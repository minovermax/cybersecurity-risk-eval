{"cik": "883569", "company": "Fossil Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the risks described elsewhere in this report, set forth below is a summary of the material risks related to an investment in our securities. These risks, some of which have occurred and/or are occurring and any of which could occur in the future, are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted, which might cause the value of our securities to decline.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse impact on our business, operations, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has continued to cause global uncertainty and disruption throughout the geographic regions in which we run our business and where our suppliers, third-party manufacturers, retail stores, wholesale customers and consumers are located. The total impact of the pandemic on us will depend on developments outside of our control, including, among other factors, the duration, spread, severity and impact of the outbreak, including the emergence of more contagious or lethal variants, availability of effective vaccines and vaccination rates, continuing and new actions that may be taken by governmental authorities to contain the outbreak or mitigate its impact, including effects of vaccine mandates, restrictions on movement and commercial activities and further stimulus and unemployment benefits, the economic or other impacts on our wholesale customers, the impact on our supply chain and manufacturing delays. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, we could experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of an economic recession or depression that may occur. In addition, any continued erosion in consumer sentiment or the effect of high unemployment on our consumer base would likely impact the financial condition of our customers and vendors, which may result in a decrease in discretionary\nconsumer spending and lower store traffic and sales, and an increase in bankruptcies or insolvencies with respect to our suppliers or wholesale customers.\nIn addition, the effects of COVID-19 could affect our ability to successfully operate in many ways, including, but not limited to, the following factors:\n\u2022 the impact of the pandemic on the economies and financial markets of the countries and regions in which we operate, including a potential global recession, a decline in consumer confidence and spending, inflationary pressures or a further increase in unemployment levels, has resulted, and could continue to result, in consumers having less disposable income and, in turn, decreased sales of our products;\n\u2022 delays or reductions in manufacturing capability at our supply partners;\n\u2022 delays in shipping products or key components, which increases costs or reduces inventory availability, especially during the third and fourth quarters;\n\u2022 \u201cshelter in place\u201d and other similar mandated or suggested isolation protocols, which have disrupted, and could continue to disrupt, our retail locations and wholesale customers\u2019 stores, as a result of store closures or reduced operating hours and decreased retail traffic;\n\u2022 the acceleration in a shift in our core customer\u2019s behaviors, expectations and shopping trends, which could result in lost sales and market share if we are not able to successfully increase the pace of our strategic initiatives development, particularly our digital strategic initiatives, and if our current digital shopping offerings do not continue to compete effectively;\n\u2022 the failure of, or delay by, our wholesale customers or third-party distributors to whom we extend credit to pay invoices, particularly our major wholesale accounts and third-party distributors that are significantly impacted by COVID-19;\n\u2022 COVID-19 and remote-work oriented phishing and similar cybersecurity attack attempts;\n\u2022 operating challenges with a fully or part time remote workforce and the effectiveness of health and safety measures;\n\u2022 retaining and attracting employees, as a result of a decrease in the number of potential employees in the workforce, including the impact of the \u201cGreat Resignation\u201d;\n\u2022 the risk that even after the pandemic has initially subsided, fear of a COVID-19 re-occurrence or new variants could cause consumers to avoid public places where our stores and those of our wholesale customers are located, such as malls and outlets; and\n\u2022 we may be required to revise certain accounting estimates and judgments such as, but not limited to, those related to the valuation of long-lived assets and deferred tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nStrategic Risks\nOur success depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond to changing fashion, functionality and product trends.\nOur success depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond to changing fashion, functionality and product trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner, especially in the wearable technology market. The purchasing decisions of consumers are highly subjective and can be influenced by many factors, such as brand image, marketing programs, functionality, product and technology features and product design. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate, gauge and respond to these changing consumer preferences in a timely manner while preserving the authenticity and the quality of our brands. Although we attempt to stay abreast of emerging lifestyle and fashion trends and technology advances affecting\naccessories, any failure by us to identify and respond to such trends could adversely affect consumer acceptance of our existing brand names and product lines, which in turn could result in inventory valuation reserves and adversely affect sales of our products. If we misjudge the market for our products, we may be faced with a significant amount of unsold finished goods inventory, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In recent years, we have experienced decreasing net sales across most product categories; in particular, net sales of watches have declined, reflecting the decline in the traditional watch market partly offset by smartwatches. If we are unable to adjust our product offerings and reverse the decrease in net sales, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends upon our ability to continue to develop innovative products, including new generation wearable technology.\nOur success depends upon our ability to continue to develop innovative products in the respective markets in which we compete. Wearable technology is a growing category of fashion that offers customers functionality with accessories, including in our hybrid and display smartwatch offerings. Our ability to respond to consumer preferences for wearable technology will depend in part on establishing successful partnerships with or acquiring companies that are involved in developing wearable technology. If we are unable to establish such partnerships or make meaningful acquisitions, this could negatively impact our ability to meet customer demands for wearable technology. Additionally, we may be unable to enhance and develop our products to satisfy consumer demands for wearable technology or we may fail to do so in a timely manner or at competitive prices. We may also fail to understand or estimate correctly the dynamics of this market, such as allowances for sales returns, warranty liabilities, inventory reserves or the allowance for bad debts attributable to this product category. The process of developing new products, particularly technology products, is complex and uncertain, and involves time, substantial costs and risks, which are further magnified when the development process involves integrating new technology or operating systems. Our inability or the inability of our partners, for technological or other reasons, some of which may be beyond our or our partners' control, to enhance, develop, manufacture, distribute and monetize wearable technology products in a timely manner, or at all, in response to changing consumer preferences for wearable technology, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or could result in our products not achieving market acceptance or becoming obsolete. If we are unable to successfully introduce new products, or if our competitors introduce new or superior products, customers may purchase increasing amounts of products from our competitors, which could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to effectively execute our e-commerce business strategy and provide a reliable digital experience for our customers, our reputation and operating results may be harmed.\nIn recent years, e-commerce has increasingly comprised a larger portion of our net revenues and has been particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to acceleration in the shift to online shopping. The success of our e-commerce business depends, in part, on third parties and factors over which we have limited control, including changing consumer preferences, both domestically and abroad, and promotional or other advertising initiatives employed by our wholesale customers or other third parties on their e-commerce sites. Any failure on our part, or on the part of our third-party digital partners, to provide attractive, reliable, secure and user-friendly e-commerce platforms could negatively impact our consumers\u2019 shopping experience, resulting in reduced website traffic, diminished loyalty to our brands and lost sales.\nThe success of our business also depends on our ability to continue to develop and maintain a reliable digital experience for our customers. We strive to give our customers a seamless omni-channel experience both in stores and through digital technologies, such as computers, mobile phones, tablets, and other devices. We also use social media to interact with our customers, enhance their shopping experience and potentially provide additional purchasing options. Our inability to develop and continuously improve our digital brand engagement and social engagement could negatively affect our ability to compete with other brands, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, we must keep up to date with competitive technology trends, including the use of new or improved technology, creative user interfaces and other e-commerce marketing tools such as paid search and mobile applications, among others, which may increase our costs and which may not succeed in increasing sales or attracting consumers. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties might adversely affect the sales in our e-commerce business, as well as damage our reputation and brands.\nAdditionally, the success of our e-commerce business and the satisfaction of our consumers depend on their timely receipt of our products. The efficient flow of our products requires that our distribution facilities have adequate capacity to support the current level of e-commerce operations and any anticipated increased levels that may follow from the growth of our e-commerce business. If we encounter difficulties with our distribution facilities, or if any such facilities were to shut down or be limited in capacity for any reason, including as a result of fire, other natural disaster, labor disruption, or pandemic\n(including as a consequence of public health directives, quarantine policies or social distancing measures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic), we could face shortages of inventory, and we could experience disruption or delay, or incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times for distributing our products to our consumers which could result in customer dissatisfaction. Any of these issues could have an adverse effect on our business and harm our reputation.\nWe regularly develop new products, features and technology, and new products introduced by us may not achieve consumer acceptance comparable to that of our existing product lines.\nWe regularly update our product offerings, particularly in the wearable technology space. As is typical with new products, market acceptance of new designs, features, technology and products is subject to uncertainty. In addition, we generally make decisions regarding product designs and technology development several months in advance of the time when consumer acceptance can be measured. If trends shift away from our products, if our wearable technology becomes outdated, if we are not able to develop and introduce new products that incorporate new technologies or if we misjudge the market for our product lines, including demand for older generation technology products, we may be faced with significant amounts of unsold inventory or other conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe failure of new product designs, technology or next generation wearable products or new product lines to gain market acceptance could also adversely affect our business and the image of our brands. Achieving market acceptance for new products or technology may also require substantial marketing efforts and expenditures to generate consumer demand. These requirements could strain our management, financial and operational resources. If we do not continue to develop innovative products that provide better design, technology and performance attributes than the products of our competitors and that are accepted by consumers, or if our future product lines misjudge consumer demands, we may lose consumer loyalty, which could result in a decline in our sales and market share.\nOur ability to grow our sales is dependent upon the implementation of our business strategy, which we may not be able to achieve.\nOur ability to grow our sales is dependent on the successful implementation of our business strategy. This includes diversification and innovation of our product offerings, continuing to develop next generation wearable technology, improving our omni-channel and digital capabilities and strategic acquisitions. If we are not successful in the expansion or development of our product offerings, our new products are not profitable or do not generate sales comparable to those of our existing businesses or we are unable to achieve our digital transformation goals, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nWe also operate FOSSIL brand stores and other watch stores globally to further strengthen our brand image. As of January 1, 2022, we operated 370 stores worldwide. The costs associated with leasehold improvements to current stores and the costs associated with opening new stores and closing low performing stores, particularly those stores that have seen a significant reduction in traffic, could materially increase our costs of operation and result in impairment charges.\nIncreased scrutiny from investors and others regarding our corporate social responsibility initiatives, including environmental, social and other matters of significance relating to sustainability, could result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation.\nInvestor advocacy groups, large and influential institutional investors, investment funds, other market participants, shareholders and customers have increasingly focused on the environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") or \u201csustainability\u201d practices of companies. These parties have placed increased importance on the implications of the social cost of their investments. If our ESG practices do not meet investor or other industry stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our brand, reputation and customer and employee retention may be negatively impacted. Any sustainability report that we publish or other sustainability disclosure we make may include our policies, practices, metrics or targets on a variety of social and ethical matters, including corporate governance, environmental compliance, employee health and safety practices, human capital management, product quality, supply chain management, and workforce inclusion and diversity. It is possible that stakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG practices or the speed of adoption. We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report and comply with various ESG practices. Also, our failure, or perceived failure, to meet the standards included in any sustainability disclosure could negatively impact our reputation, employee retention and the willingness of our customers and suppliers to do business with us.\nThe risks associated with climate change and other environmental impacts and increased focus by stakeholders on corporate responsibility issues, including those associated with climate change, could negatively affect our business and operations.\nOur business is susceptible to risks associated with climate change, including through disruption to our supply chain, potentially impacting the production and distribution of our products and availability and cost of raw materials. Increased frequency and intensity of weather events due to climate change could increase the risk of a significant disruption to our operations, including at our global offices and warehouses and transportation and manufacturing partners. There is also increased focus from our stakeholders, including large institutional investors, consumers and employees, on corporate responsibility matters. While we are addressing climate-related issues impacting our business, there can be no assurance that our stakeholders will agree with our strategy or that we will be successful in achieving our goals. In addition, concern over climate change may result in new or additional legal, legislative and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. Failure to implement our strategy or achieve our goals could damage our reputation, causing our investors, consumers or employees to lose confidence in our Company and brands, and negatively impact our operations.\nOperational Risks\nWe face risks associated with increased political uncertainty.\nThe recent invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the sanctions, bans and other measures taken by governments, organizations and companies against Russia and certain Russian citizens in response thereto has increased the political uncertainty in Europe and has strained the relations between Russia and a significant number of governments, including the U.S. The duration and outcome of this conflict, any retaliatory actions taken by Russia and the impact on regional or global economies is unknown, but could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of our operations.\nIn the U.S., the change in the U.S. government to the Biden administration has resulted in uncertainty regarding potential changes in regulations, fiscal policy, social programs, domestic and foreign relations and international trade policies. In addition, potential changes in relationships among the U.S. and China and other countries could have significant impacts on global trade and regional economic conditions, among other things. In addition, changes in the relationships between the U.S. and its neighbors, such as Mexico, could have significant, potentially negative, impacts on commerce. Further, anti-American sentiment could harm the reputation and success of U.S. companies doing business abroad.\nOur business is dependent upon its international operations, particularly in Asia and Europe. During fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, we generated 63.5%, 66.1% and 63.0%, respectively, of our net sales outside the U.S. In addition, we source the vast majority of our products from outside the U.S.\nOur ability to respond to these developments or comply with any resulting new legal or regulatory requirements, including those involving economic and trade sanctions, could reduce our sales, increase our costs of doing business, reduce our financial flexibility and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of our operations.\nOur supply chain may be disrupted by changes in U.S. trade policy with China or as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe rely on domestic and foreign suppliers to provide us with merchandise in a timely manner and at favorable prices. Among our foreign suppliers, China is the source of a substantial majority of our imports.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, increased international transit times, particularly for our leathers products and packaging, and increased shipping costs for a majority of our products. A disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise from China or a material increase in the cost of those goods or transportation without any offsetting price increases may significantly decrease our profits.\nNew U.S. tariffs or other actions against China and any responses by China, could impair our ability to meet customer demand and could result in lost sales or an increase in our cost of merchandise. This would have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nThe loss of any of our license agreements for globally recognized fashion brand names may result in the loss of significant revenues and may adversely affect our business.\nWe have entered into multi-year, worldwide exclusive license agreements for the manufacture, distribution and sale of products bearing the brand names of certain globally recognized fashion brands. We sell products under certain licensed brands, including, but not limited to, ARMANI EXCHANGE, DIESEL, DKNY, EMPORIO ARMANI, KATE SPADE NEW YORK, MICHAEL KORS, PUMA and TORY BURCH. Sales of our licensed products accounted for 50.5% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal year 2021, including MICHAEL KORS product sales, which accounted for 20.9% of our consolidated net sales, and ARMANI product sales, which accounted for 18.4% of our consolidated net sales.\nOur significant third-party fashion brand license agreements have various expiration dates between the years 2023 and 2028. In addition, many of these license agreements require us to make minimum royalty payments, spend minimum amounts on marketing, subject us to restrictive covenants or require us to comply with certain other obligations and may be terminated by the licensor if these or other conditions are not met or upon certain events. For example, our license agreement with MICHAEL KORS provides the licensor with a right to terminate some or all of the licensing rights if we fail to meet certain net sales thresholds for two consecutive years. For fiscal year 2021, we met net sales thresholds for MICHAEL KORS. If we are unable to achieve the minimum net sales thresholds, minimum marketing spend, restrictive covenants and/or other obligations of a license in the future, we would need to seek a waiver of the non-compliance from the applicable licensor or amend the agreement to modify the thresholds, covenants or obligations or face the possibility that the licensor could terminate the license agreement before its expiration date. Though waivers may be obtained for non-compliance, we, or the licensor, may instead elect to modify or terminate the license agreement.\nIn addition, we may be unable to renew our existing license agreements beyond the current term or obtain new license agreements to replace any lost license agreements on similar economic terms or at all. The failure by us to maintain or renew one or more of our existing license agreements could result in a significant decrease in our sales and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe loss of our license for Google\u2019s WEAR OS operating system may result in the loss of significant revenues and may adversely affect our business.\nOur full display smartwatches use Google\u2019s WEAR OS operating system. We have a license for WEAR OS that expires on April 27, 2023. Sales of our full display smartwatches running the WEAR OS operating system accounted for 9.1% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal year 2021. We may be unable to renew our existing license for WEAR OS beyond the current term. The failure by us to maintain or renew our license for WEAR OS or develop or license a new operating system could result in us being unable to produce and market full display smartwatches, which could result in a significant decrease in our sales and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur inability to effectively manage our retail store operations could adversely affect our results of operations.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, our global comparable retail store sales increased 3.2% versus a decrease of 25.5% in 2020, with the results in both 2020 and 2021 impacted by reduced traffic due to COVID-19. During fiscal year 2022, we anticipate closing approximately forty to fifty stores globally, depending on lease negotiations, and not opening any additional retail stores. The success of our retail business depends, in part, on our ability to close low performing stores and renew our existing store leases on terms that meet our financial targets. Our ability to open new stores on schedule or at all, to close low performing stores and to renew existing store leases on favorable terms or to operate them on a profitable basis will depend on various factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022identify suitable markets for new stores and available store locations;\n\u2022negotiate acceptable lease terms for new locations or renewal terms for existing locations, particularly for those existing locations that have experienced a significant reduction in traffic;\n\u2022hire and train qualified sales associates;\n\u2022develop new merchandise and manage inventory effectively to meet the needs of new and existing stores on a timely basis; and\n\u2022maintain favorable relationships with major developers and other landlords.\nOur plans to manage our store base may not be successful and the opening of new stores in the future may not result in an increase in our net sales even though they increase our costs. Our inability to effectively manage our retail store base could have a material adverse effect on the amount of net sales we generate and on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain key components in our products come from limited sources of supply, which exposes us to potential supply shortages that could disrupt the manufacture and sale of our products.\nWe and our contract manufacturers currently purchase a number of key components used to manufacture our products from limited sources of supply for which alternative sources may not be readily available. Any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these components could significantly harm our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and cause us to lose sales. Interruptions or delays in supply may be caused by a number of factors that are outside of our and our contract or manufacturers' control. In addition, the purchase of these components on a limited source basis subjects us to risks of price increases and potential quality assurance problems. An increase in the cost of components could make our products less competitive and result in lower gross margins. In the event that we can no longer obtain materials from these limited sources of supply, we might not be able to qualify or identify alternative suppliers in a timely fashion. Any extended interruption in the supply of any of the key components currently obtained from a limited source or delay in transitioning to a replacement supplier could disrupt our operations and significantly harm our business in any given period. If our supply of certain components is disrupted, our lead times are extended or the cost of our components increases, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially affected.\nSeasonality of our business may adversely affect our net sales and operating income.\nOur quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including seasonal cycles, timing of new product introductions, timing of orders by our customers and mix of product sales demand. Our business is seasonal by nature. A significant portion of our net sales and operating income are generated during the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year, which includes the \"back to school\" and holiday seasons. The amount of net sales and operating income generated during our fiscal fourth quarter depends upon the anticipated level of retail sales during the holiday season, as well as general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control. In addition, the amount of net sales and operating income generated during our fiscal first quarter depends in part upon the actual level of retail sales during the holiday season. The seasonality of our business may adversely affect our net sales and operating income during the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year.\nThe amount of traffic to our retail stores depends heavily on the success of the shopping malls and retail centers in which our stores are located.\nThere continues to be a significant decrease in traffic in many of the shopping malls and retail centers in which our stores are located, which has been accelerated by the impact of COVID-19, and has resulted in a significant decrease in traffic to our stores. The resulting decrease in customers for our retail stores has had an adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, several national department store anchors have closed or will be closing a number of their locations in shopping malls, which is likely to further decrease traffic and put increasing financial strain on the operators of those shopping mall locations. The loss of an anchor or other significant tenant in a shopping mall in which we have a store, continued declines in traffic to shopping malls or the closure of a significant number of shopping malls in which we have stores, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe have key facilities in the U.S. and overseas, the loss or shut down of any of which could harm our business.\nOur administrative, information technology and distribution operations in the U.S. are conducted primarily from two separate facilities located in the Dallas, Texas area. Our operations internationally are conducted from various administrative, distribution and assembly facilities outside of the U.S., particularly in China, Germany, Hong Kong, Switzerland and Vietnam. The complete or temporary loss of use of all or part of these facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur warehouse and distribution facilities in the Dallas, Texas area are operated in a special purpose sub-zone established by the U.S. Department of Commerce Foreign Trade Zone Board. Although the sub-zone allows us certain tax advantages, the sub-zone is highly regulated by the U.S. Customs Service. This level of regulation may cause disruptions or delays in the distribution of our products out of these facilities. Under some circumstances, the U.S. Customs Service has the right to shut down the entire sub-zone and, therefore, our entire warehouse and distribution facilities. During the time that the sub-zone is shut down, we may be unable to adequately meet the supply requests of our customers and our Company-owned retail stores, which could have an adverse effect on our sales, relationships with our customers, and results of operations, especially if the shutdown were to occur during our third or fourth quarter.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials could cause delays and increase costs.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of the raw materials used in our products could have a material adverse effect on our cost of sales or ability to meet our customers' demand. The price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly, depending on many factors, including natural resources, increased freight costs, increased labor costs, especially in China, increased component costs and weather conditions. Recent inflation rates in the U.S. and certain international markets have reached historical highs. While we have recently increased the prices of a number of our products as a result and may implement other price increases in the future, we may not be able to pass on all, or a significant portion of, such higher raw materials prices to our customers or such price increases may not be accepted by our customers, which could impact our margins or result in lost revenues.\nWe rely on third-party assembly factories and manufacturers; and problems with, or loss of, our assembly factories or manufacturing sources could harm our business and results of operations.\nThe majority of our watch and jewelry products are currently assembled or manufactured to our specifications by independent entities in China. All of our handbags, small leather goods, belts and soft accessories are produced by independent manufacturers. We have no long-term contracts with these independent assembly factories or manufacturers and compete with other companies for production facilities. All transactions between us and our independent assembly factories or manufacturers are conducted on the basis of purchase orders. We face the risk that these independent assembly factories or manufacturers may not produce and deliver our products on a timely basis, or at all. As a result, we cannot be certain that these assembly factories or manufacturers will continue to assemble or manufacture products for us or that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers, such as reductions in the availability of production capacity, errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control, shortages of raw materials, failures to meet production deadlines, increases in manufacturing costs or pandemic-related delays. Our future success will depend upon our ability to maintain close relationships with our current assembly factories and manufacturers and to develop long-term relationships with other manufacturers that satisfy our requirements for price, quality and production flexibility. Our ability to establish new manufacturing relationships involves numerous uncertainties, including those relating to payment terms, costs of manufacturing, adequacy of manufacturing capacity, quality control and timeliness of delivery. Any failure by us to maintain long-term relationships with our current assembly factories and manufacturers or to develop relationships with other manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture and distribute our products.\nWe do not maintain long-term contracts with our customers and are unable to control their purchasing decisions.\nWe do not maintain long-term purchasing contracts with our customers and therefore have no contractual leverage over their purchasing decisions. A decision by a major department store or other significant customer to decrease the amount of merchandise purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and operating strategy.\nWe face intense competition in the specialty retail and e-commerce industries and the size and resources of some of our competitors are substantially greater than ours, which may allow them to compete more effectively.\nWe face intense competition in the specialty retail and e-commerce industry where we compete primarily with specialty retailers, department stores and e-commerce businesses that engage in the retail sale of watches and accessories. We believe that the principal basis upon which we compete is the quality and design of merchandise and the quality of customer service. We also believe that price is an important factor in our customers' decision-making processes. Many of our competitors are, and many of our potential competitors may be, larger and have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have and therefore may be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly, devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and generate greater national brand recognition than we can, especially in the developing area of omni-channel retailing. Omni-channel retailing may include retail stores, e-commerce sites, mobile channels and other direct-to-consumer points of contact that enhance the consumer\u2019s ability to interact with a retailer in the research, purchase, returning and serving of products. The intense competition and greater size and resources of some of our competitors could have a material adverse effect on the amount of net sales we generate and on our results of operations.\nWe face competition from traditional competitors as well as new competitors in the wearable technology category.\nThere is intense competition in each of the businesses in which we compete. In all of our businesses, we compete with numerous manufacturers, importers and distributors who may have significantly greater financial, distribution, advertising and marketing resources than us. Our competitors include distributors that import watches and accessories from abroad, U.S. companies that have established foreign manufacturing relationships and companies that produce accessories domestically. In addition, we face continuing competition from technology companies that have launched smartwatch products and other wearable technology. These new competitors have not historically competed with us, and many have significantly greater financial, distribution, advertising and marketing resources than us. In addition, the impact of wearable technology products on sales of our traditional product lines may be materially adverse. Our results of operations and market position may be adversely affected by our competitors and their competitive pressures in the watch, wearable technology and fashion accessory industries.\nAny material disruption of our information systems could disrupt our business and reduce our sales.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information systems to operate our websites, process transactions, manage inventory, monitor sales and purchase, sell and ship goods on a timely basis. We utilize SAP ERP in our U.S. operations and throughout most of our European operations to support our human resources, sales and distribution, inventory planning, retail merchandising and operational and financial reporting systems of our business, and Navision in our Asian operations to support many of the same functions on a local country level. We also use tools provided by salesforce.com, inc. in our CRM initiatives. In fiscal year 2022, we also plan to implement a new global point of sale system beginning with our European retail stores. We may experience operational problems with our information systems as a result of system failures, viruses, ransomware, computer \"hackers\" or other causes. These risks may be heightened as a result of our workforce that works remotely. Any material disruption or slowdown of our systems could cause information, including data related to customer orders, to be lost, unavailable or delayed, which could result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores and customers or lost sales, which could reduce demand for our merchandise and cause our sales to decline. Moreover, the failure to maintain, or a disruption in, financial and management control systems could have a material adverse effect on our ability to respond to trends in our target markets, market our products and meet our customers' requirements.\nIn addition, we have e-commerce and other websites in the U.S. and internationally. In addition to changing consumer preferences and buying trends relating to Internet usage, we are vulnerable to certain additional risks and uncertainties associated with the Internet, including changes in required technology interfaces, website downtime and other technical failures, security breaches, and consumer privacy concerns. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could reduce e-commerce sales, increase costs and damage the reputation of our brands.\nFactors affecting international commerce and our international operations may seriously harm our financial condition.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we generated 63.5% of our net sales from outside of the U.S., and we anticipate that revenue from our international operations could account for an increasingly larger portion of our net sales in the future. Our international operations are directly related to, and dependent on, the volume of international trade and foreign market conditions. International commerce and our international operations are subject to many risks, some of which are discussed in more detail below, including:\n\u2022recessions in foreign economies;\n\u2022the adoption and expansion of trade restrictions or the occurrence of trade wars;\n\u2022limitations on repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022difficulties in protecting our intellectual property or enforcing our intellectual property rights under the laws of other countries;\n\u2022longer receivables collection periods and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022difficulties in managing foreign operations;\n\u2022social, political and economic instability;\n\u2022restrictions on travel to and from international locations;\n\u2022political tensions between the U.S. and foreign countries;\n\u2022compliance with, changes in or adoption of current, new or expanded regulatory requirements, particularly in the areas of wearable technology and data privacy;\n\u2022our ability to finance foreign operations;\n\u2022tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022U.S. government licensing requirements for exports; and\n\u2022the continuing impact of COVID-19, including any \u201cshelter in place\u201d or other similar mandated or suggested isolation protocols, which have disrupted, and could continue to disrupt, our retail locations and wholesale customers\u2019 stores, as a result of store closures or reduced operating hours and decreased retail traffic.\nThe occurrence or consequences of any of these risks may restrict our ability to operate in the affected regions and decrease the profitability of our international operations, which may seriously harm our financial condition.\nBecause we depend on foreign manufacturing, we are vulnerable to changes in economic and social conditions in Asia, particularly China, and disruptions in international travel and shipping.\nBecause a substantial portion of our watches and jewelry and certain of our handbags, sunglasses and other products are assembled or manufactured in China, our success will depend to a significant extent upon future economic and social conditions existing in China. If the factories in China are disrupted for any reason, we would need to arrange for the manufacture and shipment of products by alternative sources. While we do have initiatives in place to diversify certain of our manufacturing outside of China, because the establishment of new manufacturing relationships involves numerous uncertainties, including those relating to payment terms, costs of manufacturing, adequacy of manufacturing capacity, quality control and timeliness of delivery, we are unable to predict whether such new relationships would be on terms that we regard as satisfactory. Any significant disruption in our relationships with our manufacturing sources located in China would have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture and distribute our products. In addition, restrictions on travel to and from this and other regions, such as the travel restrictions that have occurred with COVID-19, and any delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products, including on account of the COVID-19 pandemic or other health crises, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer deadlines and timely distribute our products in order to match consumer expectations.\nThe loss of key senior management personnel or our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could negatively affect our business.\nWe depend on our senior management and other key personnel, particularly Kosta N. Kartsotis, our Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") and Chairman. We do not have \"key person\" life insurance policies for any of our personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the fashion industry is intense. Our ability to attract and retain employees, especially in the competitive market for employees with digital experience, is influenced by our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefits, employee morale, our reputation, recruitment by other employers, perceived internal opportunities, non-competition and non-solicitation agreements and macro unemployment rates. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business.\nWe must also attract, develop, motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified retail and distribution center personnel. Historically, competition for talent has been intense and the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high, which has recently further been exacerbated by the \u201cGreat Resignation\u201d and a significant number of people leaving the workforce. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain a sufficient number of qualified employees in future periods to execute on our business objectives. Additionally, our ability to meet our labor needs while also controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation and overtime regulations. If we are unable to attract, develop, motivate and retain talented employees with the necessary skills and experience, or if changes to our organizational structure, operating results, or business model, including as a result of COVID-19, adversely affect morale, hiring and/or retention, we may not achieve our objectives and our results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nOur debt agreements subject us to certain covenants, which may restrict our ability to operate our business and to pursue our business strategies. Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in our debt agreements or any agreement under which we have incurred other indebtedness, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.\nOn September 26, 2019, the Company and Fossil Partners L.P., as the U.S. borrowers, and Fossil Group Europe GmbH, Fossil Asia Pacific Limited, Fossil (Europe) GmbH, Fossil (UK) Limited and Fossil Canada Inc., as the non-U.S. borrowers, certain other subsidiaries of the Company from time to time party thereto designated as borrowers, and certain subsidiaries of the Company from time to time party thereto as guarantors, entered into a $275.0 million, subsequently reduced to $225 million, secured asset-based revolving credit agreement (the \u201cRevolving Facility\u201d) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent, J.P. Morgan AG, as French collateral agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Citizens Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as joint bookrunners and joint lead arrangers, and Citizens Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as co-syndication agents and each of the lenders from time to time party thereto.\nThe Revolving Facility imposes, and future financing agreements are likely to impose, affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities. These restrictions limit or prohibit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness or issue certain types of stock;\n\u2022pay dividends or make other distributions, repurchase or redeem our stock;\n\u2022make certain investments;\n\u2022prepay, redeem, or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022sell assets and issue capital stock of our restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022incur liens;\n\u2022enter into agreements restricting our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends, make loans to other Fossil entities or restrict the ability to incur liens;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022consolidate or merge.\nThese restrictions on our ability to operate our business, along with restrictions that may be contained in agreements evidencing or governing future indebtedness, could seriously harm our business and our ability to grow in accordance with our growth strategy by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of merger and acquisition and other corporate opportunities. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing.\nAs a result of these restrictions, we may be:\n\u2022limited in how we conduct our business;\n\u2022unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or\n\u2022unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nThe Revolving Facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests in certain circumstances. The Revolving Facility contains a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant if our Availability (as defined in the Revolving Facility) falls below a certain threshold. See Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d under the heading \u201cSources of Liquidity\u201d for an additional discussion of the financial covenants contained in the Revolving Facility.\nVarious risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants and maintain these financial tests. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. A default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. We cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers or amendments to these agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, an event of default under the Revolving Facility would permit the lenders to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under the Revolving Facility. Furthermore, the Revolving Facility is secured by liens on our assets. If we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our Revolving Facility, the applicable lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness.\nThe Revolving Facility provides the lenders considerable discretion to impose reserves or availability blocks or to determine that certain assets are not eligible for inclusion in our borrowing base, which could materially impair the amount of borrowings that would otherwise be available to us. There can be no assurance that the lenders under the Revolving Facility\nwill not take such actions during the term of that facility and, further, were they to do so, the resulting impact of such actions could materially and adversely impair our ability to meet our other obligations as they become due, among other matters.\nThe amount of borrowings permitted under our Revolving Facility may fluctuate significantly, which may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial position.\nThe amount of borrowings permitted at any time under our Revolving Facility is limited to a periodic borrowing base valuation of, among other things, our eligible accounts receivable and inventory. As a result, our access to credit under our Revolving Facility is potentially subject to significant fluctuations depending on the value of the borrowing base eligible assets as of any measurement date, as well as certain discretionary rights of the administrative agent of our Revolving Facility in respect of the calculation of such borrowing base value. Our inability to borrow at current advance rates or at all under, or the early termination of, our Revolving Facility may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial position.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.\nThe Revolving Facility provides that the lenders thereunder may extend revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $225.0 million at any time outstanding, subject to the borrowing base availability limitations. As of January 1, 2022, we did not have any amount outstanding under the Revolving Facility. The covenants under the Revolving Facility allow us to incur additional indebtedness from other sources in certain circumstances. On November 8, 2021, we sold $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our 7.00% Senior Notes due 2026 (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d). The Senior Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, and rank senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness. The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and the Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries (excluding any amounts owed by such subsidiaries to us).\nThe base and first supplemental indentures governing the Senior Notes (collectively, the \u201cIndenture\u201d) contain customary events of default and cure provisions. If an event of default (other than an event of default of the type described in the following sentence) occurs and is continuing with respect to the Senior Notes, the trustee may, and at the direction of the registered holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of the Senior Notes shall, declare the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, premium and additional amounts, if any, on the Senior Notes to be due and payable immediately. If an event of default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company occurs, the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, and premium, if any, on the Senior Notes will become immediately due and payable without any action on the part of the trustee or any holder of the Senior Notes.\nA portion of our cash flow will be required to pay interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness, and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or have future borrowings available under our Revolving Facility, to enable us to repay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. This level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022it requires us to use a meaningful percentage of our cash flow from operations for debt service and the repayment of our indebtedness, including indebtedness we may incur in the future, and such cash flow may not be available for other purposes;\n\u2022it limits our ability to borrow money or sell stock to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and debt service requirements;\n\u2022it may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and future business opportunities;\n\u2022we are more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022it may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy;\n\u2022it may increase our cost of borrowing;\n\u2022debt service requirements could make it more difficult for us to make payments on our other indebtedness; and\n\u2022there would be a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition if we were unable to service our indebtedness or obtain additional financing as needed.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our debt service obligations and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and other investments in our business will depend on our ability to generate cash from our operations in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future sources of capital under the Revolving Facility or otherwise may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we complete an acquisition, our debt service requirements could increase. We may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including the Revolving Facility, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances or restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect such actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nAny refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The Revolving Facility restricts our ability to conduct asset sales and to use the proceeds from asset sales. We may not be able to consummate these asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices and on terms that we believe are fair, and any proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. If we cannot meet our debt service obligations, the holders of our debt may accelerate our debt and, to the extent such debt is secured, foreclose on our assets. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay all of our debt.\nWe may still be able to incur significantly more debt, including secured debt. This could intensify already-existing risks related to our indebtedness.\nThe terms of the Revolving Facility contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness. However, these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Accordingly, we could incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, much of which could constitute secured, senior, or pari passu indebtedness. As of January 1, 2022, our Revolving Facility provided for unused borrowing capacity of up to $199.7 million. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nFinancial Risks\nChanges in the mix of product sales demand could negatively impact our gross profit margins.\nOur gross profit margins are impacted by our sales mix as follows:\nSales channel mix: sales from our direct retail and e-commerce channels typically provide gross margins in excess of our historical consolidated gross profit margins, while sales from our distributor, mass market and off-price channels typically provide gross margins below our historical consolidated gross profit margins.\nProduct mix: traditional watch and jewelry sales typically provide gross margins in excess of historical consolidated gross profit margins, while leather goods and private label products typically provide gross margins below our historical consolidated gross profit margins. In addition, sales of our wearable technology products have produced gross profit margins below our historical consolidated gross profit margins.\nGeographic mix: international sales typically produce gross margins in excess of our historical consolidated gross profit margins, while domestic sales typically provide gross margins below our historical consolidated gross profit margins.\nIf future sales from our higher gross margin businesses do not increase at a faster rate than our lower gross margin businesses, our gross profit margins may grow at a slower pace, cease to grow, or decrease relative to our historical consolidated gross profit margin.\nU.S. tax legislation enacted in December 2017 and potential changes to tax rates under the Biden Administration may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nOn December 22, 2017, then President Trump signed into law Public Law No. 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"), following its passage by the United States Congress. The Tax Act made significant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws, including changing the corporate tax rate to a flat 21% rate, introducing a capital investment deduction in certain circumstances, placing certain limitations on the interest deduction, modifying the rules regarding the usability of certain net operating losses, and making extensive changes to the U.S. international tax system. The new Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) provisions of the Tax Act requiring the inclusion of certain foreign earnings in U.S. taxable income increased our effective tax rate in post-Tax Act fiscal years and will continue to increase it in future years. Technically, corporate shareholders of foreign corporations generating GILTI are generally entitled to a 50% deduction against such income, lowering the effective rate of tax from 21% to 10.5%. Furthermore, they are able to recognize a foreign tax credit for 80% of local taxes paid on GILTI income. Therefore, as long as the GILTI average effective rate is 13.125% or more, the tax associated with GILTI should be fully offset by foreign tax credits. However, when a corporate group has a domestic source loss, the GILTI absorbs this loss, eliminating any ability to carry the loss forward to offset future income and also generates excess foreign tax credits which cannot be carried forward. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent foreign losses, we were not impacted by GILTI in fiscal year 2020; however in fiscal year 2021, GILTI absorbed the domestic source loss. We account for GILTI as incurred under the period cost method. Any increase in corporate tax rates or changes to the calculation of GILTI may be adverse to us. The impact of any such changes could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nWe have recorded impairment charges in the past and may record impairment charges in the future.\nWe are required, at least annually, or as facts and circumstances warrant, to test trade names to determine if impairment has occurred. We are also required to test property plant and equipment and other long lived assets for impairment as facts and circumstances warrant. Impairment may result from any number of factors, including adverse changes in assumptions used for valuation purposes, such as actual or projected net sales, growth rates, profitability or discount rates, or other variables. If the testing indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge. Should the value of trade names, property plant and equipment and other long lived assets become impaired, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIncreased competition from online only retailers and a highly promotional retail environment may increase pressure on our margins.\nThe continued increase in e-commerce competitors for retail sales and slowing mall traffic has resulted in significant pricing pressure and a highly promotional retail environment, which has been heightened by the impact of COVID-19. These factors may cause us to be more promotional with our sales prices to retailers and consumers, which could cause our gross margin to decline if we are unable to appropriately manage inventory levels and/or otherwise offset any price reductions with comparable reductions in our costs. If we have to reduce our sales prices for competitive purposes and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, our profitability will decline. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur license agreements may require minimum royalty commitments regardless of the level of product sales under these agreements.\nUnder our license agreements, we have in the past experienced, and could again in the future experience, instances where our minimum royalty commitments exceeded the royalties payable based upon our sales of the licensed products. Payments of minimum royalties in excess of the royalties based on our sales of the licensed products reduce our margins and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nForeign currency fluctuations could adversely impact our financial condition.\nWe generally purchase our products in U.S. dollars. However, we source a significant amount of our products overseas and, as such, the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the currencies of these countries, including the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Danish krone, euro, Hong Kong dollar, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, South Korean won, Malaysian ringgit, Mexican peso, Norwegian kroner, Singapore dollar, Swedish krona and Swiss franc. Due to our dependence on manufacturing operations in China, changes in the value of the Chinese yuan may have a material impact on our supply channels and manufacturing costs, including component and assembly costs.\nIn addition, changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the prices at which we sell products in foreign markets. For fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, 63.5%, 66.1% and 63.0% of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the U.S.\nIn general, our overall financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business. For example, due to a generally weaker U.S. dollar in fiscal year 2021, the translation of foreign-based net sales into U.S. dollars increased our reported net sales by approximately $33.4 million compared to fiscal year 2020. If the value of the U.S. dollar remains at its current levels or strengthens against foreign currencies, particularly against the euro, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee, Canadian dollar, South Korean won, British pound and Japanese yen, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted. Although we utilize forward contracts to help mitigate foreign currency risks (mostly relating to the euro, Canadian dollar, British pound, Japanese yen, Mexican peso and Australian dollar), foreign currency fluctuations may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe extend unsecured credit to our customers and are therefore vulnerable to any financial difficulties they may face.\nWe sell our merchandise primarily to department stores, specialty retail stores and distributors worldwide. We extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer's financial condition, usually without requiring collateral. Should any of our larger customers experience financial difficulties, we could curtail business with such customers or assume more credit risk relating to such customers' receivables. Our inability to collect on our trade accounts receivable relating to such customers could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nLegal, Compliance and Reputational risks\nA data security or privacy breach could damage our reputation, harm our customer relationships, expose us to litigation or government actions, and result in a material adverse effect to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on information technology systems, the Internet and computer networks for a substantial portion of our retail and e-commerce businesses, including credit card transaction authorization and processing. We also receive and store personal information about our customers and employees, the protection of which is critical to us. In the normal course of our business, we collect, retain, and transmit certain sensitive and confidential customer information, including credit card information, over public networks. Our customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. In addition, personal information is highly regulated at the international, federal and state level. While we and our third-party service providers have safeguards in place to defend our systems against intrusions and attacks and to protect our data, we cannot be certain that these measures are sufficient to counter all current and emerging technology threats. Despite the security measures we currently have in place, our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers have been, and will continue to be, vulnerable to theft of physical information, security breaches, hacking attempts, computer viruses and malware, ransomware, phishing, lost data and programming and/or human errors. To date, none of these risks, intrusions, attacks or human error have resulted in any material liability to us. While we carry insurance policies that would provide liability coverage for certain of these matters, if we experience a significant security incident, we could be subject to liability or other damages that exceed our insurance coverage, and we cannot be certain that such insurance policies will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. Any electronic or physical security breach involving the misappropriation, loss, or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information, including penetration of our network security or those of our third party service providers, could disrupt our business, severely damage our reputation and our customer relationships, expose us to litigation and liability, subject us to governmental investigations, fines and enforcement actions, result in negative media coverage and distraction to management and result in a material adverse effect to our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, as a result of security breaches at a number of prominent retailers and other companies, the media and public scrutiny of information security and privacy has become more intense and the regulatory environment related thereto has become more uncertain. As a result, we may incur significant costs in complying with new and existing state, federal, and foreign laws regarding protection of, and unauthorized disclosure of, personal information. A successful ransomware attack on our systems could make them inaccessible for a period of time pending the payment of a ransom to unlock the systems or our ability to otherwise restore our access to our systems.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations in the U.S. and the many countries in which we operate. Violations of laws and regulations, or changes to existing laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to domestic and international laws and regulations in a number of areas, including, but not limited to, labor, advertising, consumer protection, real estate, product safety, e-commerce, promotions, intellectual property, tax, import and export, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation, data privacy, anti-\ncompetition, environmental, health and safety. Compliance with these numerous laws and regulations is complicated, time consuming and expensive, and the laws and regulations may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the difficulty and cost to comply with them. New laws and regulations, or changes to existing laws and regulations, could individually or in the aggregate make our products more costly to produce, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, cause us to change or limit our business practices, or affect our financial condition and results of operations. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the numerous laws and regulations affecting our business, but there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws, regulations or our policies related thereto. Any such violations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results.\nTariffs or other restrictions placed on imports from China and any retaliatory trade measures taken by China could materially harm our revenue and results of operations.\nBeginning in July 2018, certain of our products have been subject to additional ad valorem duties imposed by the U.S. government on products of China under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. These tariffs, imposed via four successive \u201cLists\u201d were the result of an April 2018 determination by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative that China\u2019s acts, practices, and policies with respect to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation are unreasonable or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce. In particular, certain of our packaging and handbag products have been subject to an additional 25% ad valorem tariff, based on the first sale export price as imported into the U.S., since July 2018 (\u201cList 1\u201d). Certain of our handbag and wallet products were subject to an additional 10% ad valorem tariff, based on the first sale export price as imported into the U.S., beginning in September 2018, a rate that was then raised to 25% ad valorem from June 2019 to present (\u201cList 3\u201d). Finally, smart watches, certain jewelry products, and several of our traditional watch products were subject to an additional 15% ad valorem tariff, based on the first sale export price as imported into the U.S., beginning in September 2019, a rate that was lowered to 7.5% ad valorem from February 2020 to present (\u201cList 4A\u201d).\nBiden Administration officials have publically stated that, while these tariffs are under review, they are likely to remain in place for the foreseeable future. However, we have joined litigation before the U.S. Court of International Trade challenging the legality of the Section 301 List 3 and List 4A tariffs and seeking refunds of duties paid on imports that were subject to those tariffs. That litigation is ongoing with a decision possible in mid-2022 at the earliest. As a result, it is difficult to accurately estimate the impact on our business from these tariff actions or similar actions. However, assuming no further offsets from price increases, sourcing changes, or other changes to trade policy and regulatory rulings, all of which are currently under review, the estimated gross profit exposure from the Section 301 tariffs is approximately $8.7 million in fiscal year 2022.\nIf the tariffs continue or increase, we may be required to raise our prices, which may result in the loss of customers and harm our operating performance. Alternatively, we may seek to shift production outside of China or otherwise change our sourcing strategy for these products, resulting in significant costs and disruption to our operations. Even if the U.S. further modifies these tariffs, it is always possible that our business will be impacted by retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response to existing or future tariffs, causing us to raise prices or make changes to our operations, any of which could materially harm our revenue or operating results.\nThe loss of our intellectual property rights may harm our business.\nOur trademarks, patents and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and competitive position. We are devoted to the establishment and protection of our trademarks, patents and other intellectual property rights in those countries where we believe it is important to our ability to sell our products. However, we cannot be certain that the actions we have taken will result in enforceable rights, will be adequate to protect our products in every country where we may want to sell our products, will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or will be adequate to prevent others from seeking to prevent sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks, patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Additionally, we rely on the patent, trademark and other intellectual property laws of the U.S. and other countries to protect our proprietary rights. Even if we are successful in obtaining appropriate trademark, patent and other intellectual property rights, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the U.S. Because we sell our products internationally and are dependent on foreign manufacturing in China, we are significantly dependent on foreign countries to protect our intellectual property rights. The use of our intellectual property or similar intellectual property by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed, causing us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business. Further, if it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, any proceedings could be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail. The failure to obtain or maintain trademark, patent or other intellectual property rights could materially harm our business.\nOur products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling certain of our products.\nWe cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. The wearable technology space is rapidly developing with new innovation, resulting in a number of domestic and international patent filings for new technology. As a result, wearable technology companies may be subject to an increasing number of claims that their products infringe the intellectual property rights of competitors or non-practicing entities. We have been, are and may in the future be subject to legal proceedings involving claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties by us and our customers in connection with their marketing and sale of our products. Any such claims, whether or not meritorious, could result in costly litigation and divert the efforts of our personnel. Moreover, should we be found liable for infringement, we may be required to enter into agreements (if available on acceptable terms or at all) or to pay damages and cease making or selling certain products. Moreover, we may need to redesign or rename some of our products to avoid future infringement liability. Any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from manufacturing or selling certain of our products.\nIf an independent manufacturer or license partner of ours fails to use acceptable labor practices or otherwise comply with laws or suffers reputation harm, our business could suffer.\nWhile we have a code of conduct for our manufacturing partners, we have no control over the ultimate actions or labor practices of our independent manufacturers. The violation of labor or other laws by one of our independent manufacturers, or by one of our license partners, or the divergence of an independent manufacturer\u2019s or license partner\u2019s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the U.S. or other countries in which the violation or divergence occurred, could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation. In addition, certain of our license agreements are with named globally recognized fashion designers. Should one of these fashion designers, or any or our licensor companies, conduct themselves inappropriately or make controversial statements, the underlying brand, and consequently our business under that brand, could suffer. Any of these, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. As a result, should one of our independent manufacturers or licensors be found in violation of state or international laws or receive negative publicity, we could suffer financial or other unforeseen consequences.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nOur shares of common stock have experienced extreme volatility in market prices and trading volume in the past.\nOur common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cFOSL.\u201d On March 7, 2022, the last reported sale price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market was $11.91 per share. Our shares of common stock have experienced extreme volatility in market prices and trading volume. For example, during 2021, the market price of our common stock fluctuated from an intra-day low on the NASDAQ Global Select Market of $8.43 per share on January 4, 2021 to an intra-day high of $28.60 per share on January 27, 2021. In addition, on January 27, 2021, 20,207,700 shares of our common stock were traded, representing a trading volume significantly higher than our 2021 average daily trading volume. For comparison, during the month of December 2020, prior to the recent onset of extreme volatility, the market price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market fluctuated from intra-day low of $8.38 per share on December 29, 2020 to an intra-day high of $13.61 per share on December 14, 2020. Significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock have been accompanied by reports of strong and atypical retail investor interest, including on social media and online forums. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during January 2021, there were no material recent publicly disclosed changes in our financial condition or results of operations, such as our earnings or revenue, that are consistent with or related to the changes in our stock price. The trading price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe may continue to incur rapid and substantial increases or decreases in our stock price in the foreseeable future that may not coincide in timing with the disclosure of news or developments by or affecting us. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate dramatically, and may decline rapidly, regardless of any developments in our business.\nOverall, there are various factors, many of which are beyond our control, that could negatively affect the market price of our common stock or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock, including:\n\u2022the ongoing impacts and developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022actual or anticipated variations in our annual or quarterly results of operations, including our earnings estimates and whether we meet market expectations with regard to our earnings;\n\u2022our current inability to pay dividends or other distributions;\n\u2022publication of research reports by analysts or others about us or the specialty retail industry, which may be unfavorable, inaccurate, inconsistent or not disseminated on a regular basis;\n\u2022changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022market reaction to any additional equity, debt or other securities that we may issue in the future, and which may or may not dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022actions by institutional or significant stockholders;\n\u2022short interest in our stock and the market response to such short interest;\n\u2022a dramatic increase in the number of individual holders of our stock and their participation in social media platforms targeted at speculative investing;\n\u2022speculation in the press or investment community about our company or industry;\n\u2022strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or other investments;\n\u2022legislative, administrative, regulatory or other actions affecting our business, our industry, including positions taken by the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\u201d);\n\u2022investigations, proceedings, or litigation that involve or affect us;\n\u2022the occurrence of any of the other risk factors included or incorporated by reference in this prospectus; and\n\u2022general market and economic conditions.\nA \"short squeeze\u201d due to a sudden increase in demand of our common stock that largely exceeds supply may lead to additional price volatility.\nInvestors may purchase shares of our common stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our common stock. Speculation on the price of our common stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our common stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our common stock for delivery to lenders of our common stock. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of our common stock until additional shares of our common stock are available for trading or borrowing. This is often referred to as a \"short squeeze.\u201d A proportion of our common stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which may increase the likelihood that our common stock will be the target of a short squeeze. A short squeeze could lead to volatile price movements in shares of our common stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospectus and, once investors purchase the shares of our common stock necessary to cover their short positions, the price of our common stock may rapidly decline. Investors that purchase shares of our common stock during a short squeeze may lose a significant portion of their investment.\nOur CEO owns approximately 6.2% of our outstanding common stock.\nMr. Kosta Kartsotis owns approximately 6.2% of our common stock as of January 1, 2022. As a result, he is in a position to influence the outcome of elections of our directors, the adoption, amendment or repeal of our bylaws and any other actions requiring the vote or consent of our stockholders, and to otherwise influence our affairs.\nBecause the interests of Mr. Kartsotis may not coincide with the interests of other stockholders, Mr. Kartsotis may influence the Company to enter into transactions or agreements that other stockholders would not approve or make decisions with which other stockholders may disagree.\nOur organizational documents contain anti-takeover provisions that could discourage a proposal for a takeover.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging a proposal for a takeover. These include a provision in our certificate of incorporation authorizing the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock and provisions in our bylaws establishing advance notice procedures with respect to certain stockholder proposals. Our bylaws may be amended by a vote of 80% of the Board of Directors, subject to repeal by a vote of 80% of the stockholders. In addition, Delaware law limits the ability of a Delaware\ncorporation to engage in certain business combinations with interested stockholders. Finally, Mr. Kartsotis has the ability, by virtue of his stock ownership, to influence a vote regarding a change in control.\nFailure to meet our financial guidance or achieve other forward-looking statements we have provided to the public could result in a decline in our stock price.\nFrom time to time, we provide public guidance on our expected financial results or disclose other forward-looking information for future periods. We manage our business to maximize our growth and profitability and not to achieve financial or operating targets for any particular reporting period. Although we believe that public guidance may provide investors with a better understanding of our expectations for the future and is useful to our existing and potential stockholders, such guidance is subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Any such guidance or other forward-looking statements are predictions based on our then-existing expectations and projections about future events that we believe are reasonable. Actual events or results may differ materially from our expectations, and as such, our actual results may not be in line with guidance we have provided. We are under no duty to update any of our forward-looking statements to conform to actual results or to changes in our expectations, except as required by federal securities laws. If our financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of investors, or if we reduce our guidance for future periods, the market price of our common stock may decline and stockholders could be adversely affected. Investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk. In addition, our stock price may also decline if we fail to meet securities research analysts' projections. Similarly, if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline.\nGeneral Risks\nAny deterioration in the global economic environment, and any resulting declines in consumer confidence and spending, could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nUncertainty in global markets, slowing economic growth, high levels of unemployment, the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, rising interest rates and eroding consumer confidence can negatively impact the level of consumer spending for discretionary items. This can affect our business as it is dependent on consumer demand for our products. Global economic conditions remain uncertain, and the possibility remains that domestic or global economies, or certain industry sectors of those economies that are key to our sales, may slow or deteriorate, which could result in a corresponding decrease in demand for our products and negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe effects of economic cycles, terrorism, acts of war and retail industry conditions may adversely affect our business.\nOur business is subject to economic cycles and retail industry conditions. Purchases of discretionary fashion accessories, such as our watches, jewelry, handbags, sunglasses and other products, tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is low and consumers are hesitant to use available credit. In addition, acts of terrorism, acts of war and military action both in the U.S. and abroad can have a significant effect on economic conditions and may negatively affect our ability to procure our products from manufacturers for sale to our customers. Any significant declines in general economic conditions, public safety concerns or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect consumer spending habits could have a material adverse effect on consumer purchases of our products.\nRisks associated with foreign government regulations and U.S. trade policy may affect our foreign operations and sourcing.\nOur businesses are subject to risks generally associated with doing business abroad, such as foreign governmental regulation in the countries in which our manufacturing sources are located, primarily China. While we have not experienced any material issues with foreign governmental regulations that would impact our arrangements with our foreign manufacturing sources, we believe that this issue is of particular concern with regard to China due to the less mature nature of the Chinese market economy, the historical involvement of the Chinese government in the industry and recent trade tensions between China and the United States. If regulations or other factors were to render the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impracticable, or if our current foreign manufacturing sources were for any other reason to cease doing business with us, such a development could have a material adverse effect on our product sales and on our supply, manufacturing and distribution channels.\nOur business is also subject to risks associated with U.S. and foreign legislation and regulations relating to imports, including quotas, duties, tariffs or taxes, and other charges or restrictions on imports, which could adversely affect our operations and our ability to import products at current or increased levels. Substantially all of our import operations are subject to customs duties imposed by the governments where our production facilities are located on imported products,\nincluding raw materials. We cannot predict whether additional U.S. and foreign customs quotas, duties (including antidumping or countervailing duties), tariffs, taxes or other charges or restrictions, requirements as to whether raw materials must be purchased, additional workplace regulations or other restrictions on our imports will be imposed upon the importation of our products in the future or adversely modified, or what effect such actions would have on our costs of operations. For example, our products imported to the United States are subject to U.S. customs duties, and in the ordinary course of our business, we may from time to time be subject to claims by U.S. Customs and Border Protection for duties and other charges. Factors that may influence the modification or imposition of these restrictions may include determinations by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative that a country has denied adequate intellectual property rights or fair and equitable market access to U.S. firms, trade disputes between the United States and another country that leads to withdrawal of \u201cmost favored nation\u201d status for that country and economic and political changes within a country that are viewed unfavorably by the U.S. government, resulting in trade policy changes towards that country. Future quotas, duties, or tariffs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Future trade agreements could also provide our competitors with an advantage over us, or increase our costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nWe are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. These provisions provide for the identification of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, which is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our management, including our CEO and Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\"), does not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, in our Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions, such as growth of the Company or increased transaction volume, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nIn addition, discovery and disclosure of a material weakness, by definition, could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements. Such an occurrence could discourage certain customers or suppliers from doing business with us, result in higher borrowing costs and affect how our stock trades. This could in turn negatively affect our ability to access public debt or equity markets for capital.", "PERMNO": 79089, "SIC": 3873, "TIC": "FOSL"}
