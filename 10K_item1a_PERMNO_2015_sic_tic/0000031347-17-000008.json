RISK FACTORS\nInterested persons should carefully consider the risks described below in evaluating our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently consider immaterial, may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock would likely decline. Before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described in this section. This section should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto, and Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThere can be no guarantee that the IIoT market in general, and the lighting market segment in particular, will develop as expected, or that we will be successful in pursuing these market opportunities.\nWe have devoted and will continue to devote significant effort and resources to leverage our technology and develop and launch our platform to customers within the IIoT market. However, to date, the market for our products has not developed as quickly as anticipated, and our efforts to capitalize on these opportunities have not produced the results we anticipated. Our efforts to capitalize on these opportunities may not be successful in the near term, or at all. Furthermore, for the last several years, revenues from our legacy embedded systems products have been declining, and we anticipate that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future.\nWe have decided to focus predominantly on lighting controls within the IIoT as our targeted market. As we have a limited operating history in this market segment, we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may impact our ability to gain market acceptance for our lighting control products.\nIn recent years, we have invested substantial resources in the development and commercialization of control networking solutions for the lighting market. However, we have a limited operating history in this market segment, and we may not recognize a meaningful amount of revenues from these efforts in the near future, or at all. Our efforts to gain market acceptance for our lighting control products and solutions are subject to considerable risk and uncertainty, including:\n\u2022\nthe risk of competition and emerging technologies (see \u201cIf we do not develop and maintain adequate distribution channels, our revenues will be harmed\u201d for additional information on the risks associated with competing for market share);\n\u2022\nthe risk that we will not be able to develop adequate sales channels for these new products and services (see \u201cOur IIoT revenues may not meet expectations, which could cause volatility in the price of our stock\u201d for additional information on the risks associated with establishing new sales channels);\n\u2022\nthe risk that we misjudge the market and fail to develop solutions that meet the requirements of our existing or potential customers;\n\u2022\nthe risk that our solutions will suffer security breaches or unintended releases of private data;\n\u2022\nthe risk that our products will not perform adequately due to defect or misuse by customers (see \u201cLiabilities resulting from defects in or misuse of our products, whether or not covered by insurance, may delay our revenues and increase our liabilities and expenses\u201d for additional information on the risks associated with defective or misused products);\n\u2022\nthe risk that our supply chain for components is unable to meet our demand (see \u201cBecause we depend on a limited number of key suppliers and in certain cases, a sole supplier, the failure of any key supplier to produce timely and compliant products could result in a failure to ship products, or could subject us to higher prices, which would harm our results of operations and financial position\u201d for additional information on the risks associated with manufacturing).\nWe have changed our business model significantly in recent years, which makes it difficult to evaluate our prospects and forecast our future operating results.\nAlthough we commenced our business in 1988, we have made significant changes to our business model in recent years. Historically, we derived all of our revenues from our embedded systems and Grid businesses. However, in 2014, we sold our Grid business, and over the last several years, we have experienced a decline in revenues from our legacy embedded systems products and services. In addition, we expect to see further reductions in our shipments to Enel.\nIn recent years, we have shifted our focus to networking solutions for the outdoor lighting market. Unlike our legacy embedded systems products, which are typically sold to OEMs for incorporation into their products, which are then sold to their commercial and industrial customers, our lighting solutions products are more project based, being sold through energy services companies and distributors to municipalities, enterprise and educational campuses, retailers, and other end users. In addition, our outdoor lighting solutions typically generate lower overall gross margins than do our embedded systems products.\nAs we have a limited operating history with our lighting solutions, our ability to forecast our future operating results and effectively assess our future prospects is subject to a number of uncertainties that may impact our ability to plan for and model future growth. Our historical revenue growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance. Further, in future periods, our revenues could decline for a number of reasons, including the failure to offset the expected decline in revenues from our embedded systems products by an increase in sales of our lighting solutions, changes in our pricing structure, increased competition in the IIoT market generally or in the lighting market in particular, or our failure, for any reason, to capitalize on growth opportunities. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by companies in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations, and our business could suffer.\nOur revenues may not meet expectations, and our operating expenses may be higher than we anticipate, which could cause volatility in the price of our stock.\nAs we attempt to grow our IIoT business, we will commit significant resources developing new products in emerging markets. In addition, our IIoT business operates in nascent markets, such as outdoor lighting and controls, in which we have yet to build a reliable customer base. As a result, sales of our products are unpredictable and yet to be proven, and sales and marketing costs related to our products may be significant. These factors could have a negative impact on our revenues and make it difficult to project our financial results, which could cause declines and volatility in our stock price. Additionally, because we are operating\nin an emerging market, risks that we are not currently able to identify are likely to materialize and could negatively impact our operations and financial condition.\nEmerging markets are particularly dynamic and highly competitive, and we may lose sales to our competitors, which would harm our revenues and results of operations.\nCompetition in the IIoT market is intense and involves rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions, industry consolidations, effective management of distribution channels, rapid changes in customer or regulatory requirements, and localized market requirements. In each of our existing and target markets, we compete with a wide array of manufacturers, vendors, strategic alliances, systems developers and other businesses. The future of our IIoT business depends significantly on our ability to react to changing customer needs by enhancing our existing products and developing new products. There can be no guarantee, however, that new products and product enhancements will be accepted by businesses and consumers. If we make investments in technologies that do not gain market acceptance, our business may not grow as anticipated. In addition, future product offerings by our competitors can render our products obsolete. Any failure to evolve with emerging technologies and our competitors could cause a loss of market share and result in declining revenues.\nThe principal competitive factors that affect the markets for our products include the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to anticipate changes in customer or regulatory requirements and to develop, or improve, our products to meet these requirements in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nthe price and features of our products such as adaptability, scalability, functionality, ease of use, and the ability to integrate with other products;\n\u2022\nour product reputation, quality, performance, and conformance with established industry standards;\n\u2022\nour ability to expand our product line to address our customers\u2019 requirements;\n\u2022\nour ability to effectively manage and expand our distribution channels to address new markets for current and future products;\n\u2022\nour ability to meet a customer\u2019s required delivery schedules;\n\u2022\na customer\u2019s willingness to do business with us because of our size and perceived concerns regarding our liquidity and financial strength relative to our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe risk of industry consolidation, which is particularly high in emerging markets such as the IIoT;\n\u2022\nour customer service and support;\n\u2022\nwarranties, indemnities, and other contractual terms; and\n\u2022\ncustomer relationships and market awareness.\nCompetitors for our IIoT products include some of the largest companies in the electronics industry, operating either alone or together with trade associations and partners. Key company competitors include companies such as Cimcon Lighting, Inc., Cree Inc., Digi International, General Electric, LED Roadway Lighting, Maxim Integrated Products, Philips, Siemens, Silver Spring Networks, STMicroelectronics, Telensa, Texas Instruments, and Tridium. Key industry standard and trade group competitors include BACnet, DALI, DeviceNet, HART, Konnex, Profibus, ZigBee, and the ZWave Alliance in the IIoT market. Each of these standards and/or alliances is backed by one or more competitors. For example, the ZigBee alliance includes over 300 member companies with promoter members, such as Ember, Emerson, Freescale, Kroger, Landis+Gyr (a subsidiary of Toshiba), Philips, Reliant Energy, Schneider Electric, STMicroelectronics, Tendril, and Texas Instruments. Additionally, because we are operating in an emerging market, it is likely that additional competitors could surface and rapidly gain market share.\nMany of our competitors, alone or together with their trade associations and partners, have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, service and other resources, significantly greater name recognition, and broader product offerings, all of which may impact the willingness of customers and potential customers to do business with us. If we are unable to compete effectively in any of the markets we serve, our revenues, results of operations, and financial position would be harmed.\nThe sales cycle for our products is often lengthy and unpredictable.\nThe sales cycle between initial customer contact and execution of a contract or license agreement with a customer or purchaser of our products can vary widely. Initially, we must educate our customers about the potential applications of and cost savings associated with our products.\nIf we are successful in this effort for our embedded systems products, OEMs will typically conduct extensive and lengthy product evaluations before making a decision to design our products into their offerings. Once the OEM decides to incorporate our products, volume purchases of our products are generally delayed until the OEM\u2019s product development, system integration,\nand product introduction periods have been completed. In addition, changes in our customers\u2019 budgets, or the priority they assign to control network development, could also affect the sales cycle.\nFor our outdoor lighting controls products, the sales cycle can also be extended. As a nascent market, many of our sales channel partners, as well as end use customers, are not aware of the benefits our controls technology can bring to their lighting systems. This requires extensive educational efforts on our part, which, if successful, can lead to one or more projects that deploy our lighting control solution. For larger projects, this typically commences with a trial deployment of relatively low value to us. If the trial is successful, the end use customer may commence a full scale deployment that could take months or years to complete.\nIn addition, potential customers for our products, both embedded systems and outdoor lighting controls, include local, state and federal government authorities. For several reasons, sales to government authorities can be extended and unpredictable. Government authorities generally have complex budgeting, purchasing, and regulatory processes that govern their capital spending, and their spending is likely to be adversely impacted by economic conditions. In addition, in many instances, sales to government authorities may require field trials and may be delayed by the time it takes for government officials to evaluate multiple competing bids, negotiate terms, and award contracts. We further face the risk of cancellation during development and production due to regulatory, government and geopolitical changes, and delays in installing, operating, and evaluating the results of any field trials before full implementation of our products.\nFor these reasons, the sales cycle associated with our IIoT products is subject to a number of significant risks that are beyond our control. Consequently, if our forecasted customer orders are not realized, our revenues could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the extended sales cycle may result in our inability to recognize revenue from existing or new projects until the end of several fiscal quarters. This may also make it difficult to predict our financial results and increase the volatility of our stock price.\nIf we are not able to develop or enhance our products in a timely manner, our revenues will suffer.\nDue to the nature of development efforts in general, we can experience delays in the introduction of new or improved products beyond our original projected shipping date for such products. Historically, when these delays have occurred, we experienced an increase in our development costs and a delay in our ability to generate revenues from these new products. In addition, such delays could cause us to incur penalties if our deliveries are delayed, could otherwise impair our relationship with any of our customers that were relying on the timely delivery of our products in order to complete their own products or projects, or could cause the customer to cancel orders or to seek alternate sources of supply or other remedies. Any delay in the introduction of new products could impact future revenue targets or forecasts.\nWe are sometimes required to modify our products to meet local rules and regulations. We may not be able to increase the price of such products to reflect the costs of such modifications, given competitive markets. In addition, given the long-term nature of development activities, we may be required to undertake such modifications prior to receiving firm commitments or orders from our customers. In either of these or other similar scenarios, we may not be able to recover our costs attributable to required product modifications.\nWe intend to continue investing resources in our development activities, which will expose us to risks, such as protection of intellectual property, investment risk, and labor costs and other matters. We could also be adversely affected by delays or cost increases experienced by third parties that are developing products on our behalf.\nIf we do not develop and maintain adequate distribution channels, our revenues will be harmed.\nThe market for our products is new and unproven, and we cannot rely solely on our existing distributors to sell our products. Therefore, we are focused on expanding our distribution channel to include new distributors in order to generate revenue from product sales. We expect that the distribution channel for our products will be dispersed and it is difficult to predict how long it will take and how costly it will be to develop. We may not be successful in developing and maintaining adequate distribution channels within our expected timeframe and cost expectations, if at all. In addition, if any of our new or existing distributor partners fail to dedicate sufficient resources to market and sell our products, our revenues would suffer. Furthermore, if our existing distributor partners were to significantly reduce their inventory levels for our products, we could expect a decrease in service levels to our end-use customers.\nSales of our products may fail to meet our financial targets, which would negatively impact our results of operations and expected return on investment in the IIoT market.\nWe have invested and intend to continue to invest significant resources in the development and sales of products in the emerging IIoT market, particularly in the outdoor lighting market segment. If we are unable to receive orders for, ship, and recognize revenue for our products in a timely manner, and in the quantities and at prices in line with our targets, our financial results will be harmed. Our long-term financial goals include expectations for a return on these investments, but we may or may not ever realize any return whatsoever on this investment of resources.\nOur market share in our existing embedded systems business has declined due to increased competition, reduced levels of investment in our LONWORKS product line, and pricing pressures faced around the world. Moreover, recent revenues generated from our embedded systems business have failed to meet our expectations. We expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future, which could cause our operating results to suffer to the extent we are not able to generate offsetting revenues and gross profit through the sale of our control networking solutions for the outdoor lighting market. If this market share loss were to accelerate, our ability to continue funding our entry into the outdoor lighting segment could be harmed.\nIn order to achieve our financial targets, we believe that we must meet the following objectives:\n\u2022\nAchieve acceptance of our products in the IIoT market, particularly the outdoor lighting market, in order to increase our revenues;\n\u2022\nManage our operating expenses to a reasonable percentage of revenues; and\n\u2022\nManage our cash resources prudently.\nEven if we meet these objectives, there can be no assurance that we will meet our overall financial targets and objectives.\nA significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed. Therefore, if we cannot achieve our revenue targets, our use of cash balances would increase, our losses would increase, and/or we would be required to take additional actions necessary to reduce expenses. We cannot assure you that we will meet any or all of these objectives to the extent necessary to achieve our financial goals and, if we fail to achieve our goals, our results of operations are likely to be harmed.\nIn our legacy embedded systems business, we may be unable to promote and expand acceptance of our open, interoperable control systems over competing protocols, standards, or technologies.\nLONWORKS and IzoT technology are open, meaning that many of our technology patents are broadly licensed without royalties or license fees. As a result, our IIoT customers are able to develop hardware and software solutions that compete with some of our products. Because some of our customers are OEMs that develop and market their own control systems, these customers, in particular, could develop competing products based on our open technology. For instance, we have published all of the network management commands required to develop software that competes with our LNS software.\nIn addition, many of our IIoT competitors are dedicated to promoting closed or proprietary systems, technologies, software and network protocols or product standards that differ from or are incompatible with ours. We also face strong competition from large trade associations that promote alternative technologies and standards for particular vertical applications or for use in specific countries. These include BACnet, DALI, and KNX in the buildings market; DeviceNet, HART, and ProfiBus in the industrial controls market; TCN in the rail transportation market; and Echonet, ZigBee, and Z-Wave in the home control markets.\nThe ability of our IIoT products to interoperate with multiple standards is important to our success. Our technologies, protocols, or standards may not be successful or we may decide not to invest our resources at the levels required in order to compete with new or enhanced products or standards introduced by our IIoT product line competitors, which would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are increasingly dependent on third-party developers.\nWe are increasingly reliant on various third parties for the development of software used in our products. There is a risk that the software provided by these third parties could contain errors or defects that could adversely impact the quality of our products. In addition, these third parties may use open source or other code that contains security flaws, which may cause our products to be more prone to hacking or other security attacks. We may also be negatively impacted by employee turnover or other challenges that these third-party developers face in their own businesses. The materialization of any of these risks would impact our ability to deliver quality products on a timely basis, which could adversely impact our reputation and brand and harm our business and operating results.\nIn addition, many of these third-party developers are located in markets that are subject to political risk, intellectual property misappropriation, corruption, infrastructure problems and natural disasters in addition to country specific privacy and data security risks, given current legal and regulatory environments. The failure of these third parties to meet their obligations and adequately deploy business continuity plans in the event of a crisis and/or the development of significant disagreements, natural or man-made disasters or other factors that materially disrupt our ongoing relationship with these developers could negatively affect our operations.\nBecause we depend on a limited number of key suppliers and, in certain cases, a sole supplier, the failure of any key supplier to produce timely and compliant products could result in a failure to ship products, or could subject us to higher prices, which would harm our results of operations and financial position.\nOur future success will depend significantly on our ability to timely manufacture our products cost effectively, in sufficient volumes, and in accordance with quality standards. For most of our products requiring assembly, we rely on a limited number of contract electronic manufacturers (CEMs), principally Bel-Fuse. These CEMs procure material and assemble, test, and inspect the final products to our specifications. This strategy involves certain risks, including reduced control over quality, costs, delivery schedules, availability of materials, components, finished products, and manufacturing yields. For example, an extended delay in the supply of a key component could disrupt the manufacturing of our products. Any such interruption in the supply of key components could therefore have a material adverse effect on our customer relationships and revenues. As a result of these and other risks, our CEMs could demand price increases for manufacturing our products. The Bel-Fuse factories, where our products are manufactured, are located in China. The Chinese government maintains programs, whereby labor rates for the manufacture of our products will increase over time. In addition, our agreements with our CEMs make us responsible for components and subassemblies purchased by the CEMs when based on our forecasts or purchase orders. Accordingly, we will be at risk for any excess and obsolete inventory purchased by our CEMs. Lastly, CEMs can experience turnover, instability, and lapses in manufacturing or component quality, exposing us to additional risks as well as missed commitments to our customers.\nWe also maintain manufacturing agreements with a limited number of semiconductor manufacturers for the production of key products. Cypress Semiconductor is the sole licensee, manufacturer and distributor for the Cypress Neuron, which is an important part of the LONWORKS portfolio. As a result, we or our customers may experience longer lead times and higher pricing for these parts, which could result in reduced orders for our products from these same customers. In addition, Cypress Semiconductor could decide to reduce or cease production of the Neuron chip in the future, at any time, with or without advance notice to us.\nThe FT 5000 free topology transceiver and the Neuron 5000 are sole sourced from the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) foundry through our aggregator Open Silicon. In addition, we currently purchase several key products and components from sole or limited source suppliers with which we do not maintain signed agreements that would obligate them to supply to us on negotiated terms. Any sole source relationship could make us vulnerable to price increases, particularly where we do not maintain long-term supply agreements with the supplier, or to supply disruptions that would result if the supplier issued an end of life notice with respect to a key product.\nWe are continuing to review the impact that economic factors are having on our suppliers. Some of these suppliers are large, well-capitalized companies, while others are smaller and more highly leveraged. In order to mitigate these risks, we may take actions such as increasing our inventory levels and/or adding additional sources of supply. Such actions may increase our costs and increase the risk of excess and obsolete inventories. Even if we undertake such actions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent any disruption in the supply of goods and services we receive from these suppliers.\nWe may also elect to change any of these key suppliers. As part of such a transition, we may be required to purchase certain raw material and in-process inventory from the existing supplier and resell it to the new source. In addition, if any of our key suppliers were to stop manufacturing our products or supplying us with our key components, it could be expensive and time consuming to find a replacement. Also, as our business grows, we will be required to expand our business with our key suppliers\nor find additional sources of supply. There is no guarantee that we would be able to find acceptable alternative or additional sources. Additional risks that we face if we must transition between CEMs include:\n\u2022\nmoving raw material, in-process inventory, and capital equipment between locations, some of which may be in different parts of the world;\n\u2022\nreestablishing acceptable manufacturing processes with a new work force; and\n\u2022\nexposure to excess or obsolete inventory held by contract manufacturers for use in our products.\nThe failure of any key manufacturer to produce a sufficient number of products on time, at agreed quality levels, and fully compliant with our product, assembly and test specifications could result in our failure to ship products in a timely manner or at all, which would adversely affect our revenues and gross profit, and could result in claims against us by our customers, which could harm our results of operations and financial position. Any such failures could also have a negative impact on our ability to project our financial results, which could result in volatility in our stock price.\nOur business depends on the Internet and its continued access and development.\nThe Internet is crucial to the operations of many of our IIoT products and is a key component of the IIoT market as a whole. Our reliance on the Internet exposes us to a number of risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control, including risks related to privacy and data security. It is difficult to quantify the impact that any future security or performance problems associated with the Internet may have on our products and revenues.\nIn addition, state, federal and foreign regulators could adopt laws and regulations that impose additional burdens on companies that conduct business over the Internet. The growth and development of the market for online services may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws or laws that may inhibit the use of Internet-based communications or the information contained in these communications. The adoption of any additional laws or regulations may impact the growth of the IIoT market. Any new legislation or regulations, application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business, or application of existing laws and regulations to the IIoT and other related services could increase our costs and harm our growth. In particular, there is increasing focus on privacy and data security regulations applicable to the IoT. For example, the Federal Trade Commission released a report on January 27, 2015 with recommendations for privacy and data security recommendations applicable to connected devices, objects and sensors. In addition, the EU intends to adopt new, stricter standards around privacy and data security. We may be required to re-engineer our products and incur additional costs to comply with new regulations, any of which would negatively impact our business.\nIf our IIoT solutions become subject to cyber-attacks, or if public perception is that they are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, our reputation and business would suffer.\nWe have designed our IIoT products, including our outdoor lighting solutions products, to interoperate with other third-party products and systems. Although we attempt to safeguard our products and solutions from cybersecurity threats, the potential for cyber security attacks continues to evolve in scope and frequency.\nAdvances in and expanding availability of technical tools to enable cybersecurity attacks, and increasing sophistication of the threats, deepen the risk of potential security failures. This risk expands as new protocols and devices are implemented into our products and systems, and as customer requirements evolve. Should our products, or the combination of our products into third party systems, fail to prevent or be unable to withstand any such threats or cyber-attacks, or if our partners or customers fail to safeguard the technologies, products or the systems with adequate security policies or otherwise, our business and reputation may be harmed.\nWe have attempted to design certain of our products to prevent and monitor unauthorized access, misuse, modification or other activities related to those products and the systems into which the products are intended to be placed. Despite our security measures, our products or systems may be subject to unauthorized break ins, viruses, disruptions, high-jacking, cyber terrorism, misuse, or other unauthorized tampering or modification. Should our products fail to perform, or be unable to withstand a cyber-attack, we could face legal liability, and encounter material adverse financial and reputational harm.\nIn addition, we believe that there could be incidents of security breaches in the future which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility, regardless of whether or not the problem is due or related to the performance of our particular products or systems. Any such publicity could have a negative effect on public confidence, or cause a perception that our solutions are or could be subject to similar attacks or breaches, and our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock, independent of the direct effects on our business.\nFurthermore, because some of the information collected by some of our solutions, is or could be considered confidential consumer information in some jurisdictions, a cyber-attack could cause a violation of applicable privacy, consumer or security laws, which could cause our company to face financial or legal liability, should a security breach occur, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nWe are dependent on technology systems and third-party content that are beyond our control.\nOur success in the IIoT market will depend in part on the availability of online services and Internet connections to facilitate data transmission. In most instances, these services will be provided by third parties and will be outside of our control. Even when we are not responsible for connectivity or other problems, users of our products may attribute the problem to us. For example, many of our customers rely on the capacity, reliability and security of wireless networks owned and controlled by third parties to use our IIoT products. However, the price of access and operational integrity of online services, wireless networks and Internet connections are beyond our control. As a result, it may be difficult to identify the source of problems if they occur. This could diminish our brand and harm our business, divert the attention of our technical personnel from our product development efforts or cause significant customer relations problems.\nInformation Technology system security failures, cyber-attacks, and other technological breaches could cause harms to our business.\nWe also rely on the security of our third party providers to protect our proprietary information and information of our customers. Information technology system failures, including a breach of our or our third party providers\u2019 data security, could disrupt our ability to function in the normal course of business by potentially causing, among other things, an unintentional disclosure of customer information. Despite our implementation of security measures or those of our third party providers, information systems may be vulnerable to threats such as computer hacking, cyber-terrorism or other unauthorized attempts by third parties to access, modify or delete our or our customers\u2019 data or otherwise disrupt our systems. Any such breach could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and our reputation as a provider of data collection, and secure and reliable device connection, collaboration and communications solutions, including legal claims for damages or injunctive relief under state, federal and foreign laws, reputational damage, and decreased revenues.\nWe have designed our IIoT products and solutions products to interoperate with other third party products and systems. Although we attempt to safeguard our products and solutions from cybersecurity threats, the potential for cyber security attacks continues to evolve in scope and frequency.\nBecause our products use components or materials that may be subject to price fluctuations, shortages, interruptions of supply, or discontinuation, we may be unable to ship our products in a timely fashion, which would adversely affect our revenues, harm our reputation and negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe may be vulnerable to price increases for products, components, or materials, such as silver, copper, and cobalt. We generally do not enter into forward contracts or other methods of hedging against supply risk for these items. In addition, we have in the past and may in the future experience shortages or interruptions in supply for certain of these items, including products or components that have been or will be discontinued, which can cause us to delay shipments beyond targeted or announced dates. We have also recently reduced our inventory levels, which could impact our ability to supply our customers with products in a timely manner if there was an unexpected increase in demand. Such shortages or interruptions could result from events outside our control, as was the case with the earthquake and tsunami in Japan in March 2011. To help address these issues, we may decide from time to time to purchase quantities of these items that are in excess of our estimated requirements. As a result, we could be forced to increase our excess and obsolete inventory reserves to provide for these excess quantities, which could harm our operating results. In addition, if a component or other product goes out of production, we may be required to requalify substitute components or products, or even redesign our products to incorporate an alternative component or product.\nIf we experience any shortage of products or components of acceptable quality, or any interruption in the supply of these products or components, or if we are not able to procure them from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable period of time, our revenues, gross profits or both could decrease. In addition, under the terms of some of our contracts with our customers, we may also be subject to penalties if we fail to deliver our products on time.\nWe face operational and other risks associated with our international operations.\nRisks inherent in our international business activities include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\ntiming of and costs associated with localizing products for foreign countries and lack of acceptance of non-local products in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nthat the nature and composition of our products may subject us to any number of additional legal requirements, which might include, but are not limited to, data privacy regulations, import/export regulations and other similar requirements;\n\u2022\ninherent challenges in managing international operations;\n\u2022\nthe burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and any related implementation costs; the applicability of foreign laws that could affect our business or revenues, such as laws that purport to require that we return payments that we received from insolvent customers in certain circumstances; and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs, and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\ninherent cultural differences that could make it more difficult to sell our products or could result in allegations that sales activities have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws that prohibit improper payments in connection with efforts to obtain business;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of tariffs or other trade barriers on the importation of our products;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\neconomic and political conditions in the countries where we do business;\n\u2022\ndiffering vacation and holiday patterns in other countries, particularly in Europe;\n\u2022\nincreased costs of labor, particularly in China;\n\u2022\nlabor actions generally affecting individual countries, regions, or any of our customers, which could result in reduced demand for, or could delay delivery or acceptance of, our products; and\n\u2022\ninternational terrorism.\nAny of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations, and our financial condition.\nAdverse changes in general economic or political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our business or operating results.\nOur business can be affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control, such as general geopolitical, economic, and business conditions. In addition, political uncertainty in the countries where we seek to do business may impact the timing, as well as our ultimate ability, of obtaining new customers and implementing new systems.\nIn addition, there could be a number of follow-on effects from the credit crisis on our business, such as the insolvency of certain of our key customers, which could impair our distribution channels or result in the inability of our customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products.\nThis uncertainty about future economic and political conditions continues to make it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. We continue to see the effects of the tentative economy on our IIoT revenues.\nIf economic activity in the U.S. and other countries\u2019 economies remains weak, many customers may continue to delay, reduce, or even eliminate their purchases of networking technology products. This could result in reductions in sales of our products, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of our technologies, increased price competition, and increased exposure to excess and obsolete inventory. For example, distributors could decide to reduce inventories of our products. If conditions in the global economy, U.S. economy or other key vertical or geographic markets we serve remain uncertain or continue to be weak, we would experience material negative impacts on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources, and liquidity.\nOur executive officers and technical personnel are critical to our business.\nOur success depends substantially on the performance of our executive officers and key employees. Due to the specialized technical nature of our business, we are particularly dependent on our Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers, as well as our technical personnel. Our future success will depend on our ability to attract, integrate, motivate and retain qualified executive, managerial, technical, sales, and operations personnel, particularly given the overall economic climate and the emphasis on reducing expenses at our company.\nCompetition for qualified personnel in our business areas is intense, and we may not be able to continue to retain qualified executive officers and key personnel and attract new officers and personnel when necessary. Our product development and marketing functions are largely based in Silicon Valley, which is a highly competitive marketplace. It may be particularly difficult\nto recruit, relocate and retain qualified personnel in this geographic area. Moreover, the cost of living, including the cost of housing, in Silicon Valley is known to be high. Because we are legally prohibited from making loans to executive officers, we will not be able to assist potential key personnel as they acquire housing or incur other costs that might be associated with joining our company. In addition, if we lose the services of any of our key personnel and are not able to find suitable replacements in a timely manner, our business could be disrupted, other key personnel may decide to leave, and we may incur increased operating expenses in finding and compensating their replacements.\nIf we are unable to obtain additional funds when needed, our business could suffer.\nFor the last several years, our combined cash, cash equivalent, and short-term investment balance has declined. As we continue to implement our long-term strategic focus on the IIoT business, including the outdoor lighting controls market, this trend may continue.\nAs our cash balances decline, customers or potential customers may become less interested in doing business with us, or we may not satisfy the financial criteria they have established for their suppliers. In addition, from time to time we may also decide to use a portion of our cash balances to settle alleged warranty issues that may arise with our customers or\u00b8 as noted under the heading \"Legal Proceedings,\" in connection with litigation. We may do so even if we do not believe we have liability to our customers or in connection with such litigation, in order to limit our risk, reduce outlays to third party providers, and for administrative convenience. In the future, to the extent that our revenues grow or as we may determine necessary to maintain adequate supply levels, we may experience higher levels of inventory and accounts receivable, which will also use our cash balances. In addition, to the extent we plan to make alternate uses of our facilities, we may incur additional cash expenditures. We may also use our cash reserves to strategically acquire or invest in other companies, products, or technologies that are complementary to our business. Lastly, our combined cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment balances could be negatively affected by the various risks and uncertainties that we face, especially in light of our focus on the nascent and emerging IIoT things market, and any changes in our planned cash outlay could negatively affect our existing cash reserves.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing in the future, including, but not limited to, being able to draw on funds under our existing credit facilities or being able to incur indebtedness or sell equity if that became necessary or desirable. In addition, if we do not meet our revenue targets, our use of our cash balances would increase due to the fact that a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed. If we were not able to obtain additional financing when needed, or on acceptable terms, our ability to invest in additional research and development resources and sales and marketing resources could be adversely affected, which could hinder our ability to sell competitive products into our markets on a timely basis and harm our business.\nOur current stock price and corresponding market valuation could give rise to stockholder activism or hostile takeover attempts, which could be harmful to our business.\nBecause the current trading price of our common stock and aggregate market capitalization are low, there is a risk that we could face stockholder activism or hostile takeover attempts, which could divert management\u2019s attention from its strategic plan to build stockholder value through the expansion of our lighting solutions business. If the IIoT market in general, and the outdoor lighting market segment in particular, do not materialize as anticipated, if our control networking solutions and other product offerings are not accepted and utilized, or if we are subject to a hostile takeover at a depressed valuation, we may have to devote a significant amount of time and resources without any return on our investment. This could cause us to suffer significant financial losses and could also have a negative impact on our reputation and results of operations, any of which would likely cause our stock price to decline.\nVoluntary and/or industry standards and governmental regulatory actions in our markets could limit our ability to sell our products.\nStandards bodies, which are formal and informal associations that attempt to set voluntary, non-governmental product standards, are influential in many of our target markets. We participate in many voluntary and/or industry standards organizations around the world in order to help prevent the adoption of exclusionary standards as well as to promote standards for our products. However, we do not have the resources to participate in all standards processes that may affect our markets, and our efforts to influence the direction of those standards bodies in which we do participate may not be successful. Many of our competitors have significantly more resources focused on standards activities and may influence those standards in a way that would be disadvantageous to our products and thereby make it difficult for us to achieve our business and financial objectives.\nMany of our products and the industries in which they are used are subject to U.S. and foreign regulation. In addition, the markets for our IIoT products may experience a movement towards standards based protocols driven by governmental action,\nsuch as those being considered in the U.S. by NIST. To the extent that we do not adopt such protocols or do not succeed in achieving adoption of our own protocols as standards or de facto standards, sales of our IIoT products may be adversely affected. Moreover, even if our own protocols are adopted as standards, we run the risk that we could lose business to competing implementations.\nThe adoption of voluntary and/or industry standards or the passage of governmental regulations, for example by state utility commissions or national regulatory bodies such as FERC in the United States and PTB or BSI in Germany, that are incompatible with our products or technology could limit the market opportunity for our products or result in increased costs, which could harm our revenues, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to numerous governmental regulations concerning the manufacturing and use of our products. We must stay in compliance with all such regulations and any future regulations. Any failure to comply with such regulations, and the unanticipated costs of complying with future regulations, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe manufacture and sell products incorporating electronic components that may contain materials that are subject to government regulation in the locations in which our products are manufactured and assembled, as well as the locations where we sell our products. Since we operate on a global basis, maintaining compliance with regulations concerning the materials used in our products is a complex process that requires continual monitoring of regulations and ongoing compliance procedures. For example, in 2012 the European Union issued recast regulations regarding the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (\"RoHS\"), and in 2014, the SEC rules requiring companies to publicly disclose their use of \"conflict minerals\" that originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or an adjoining country also become effective. The adoption of any unanticipated new regulations that significantly impact the various components we use or require that we use more expensive components would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur reliance on third-party manufacturers exposes us to the risk that conflict minerals that are contained in our products have originated in the DRC or an adjoining country. We have incurred and expect to incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements. Moreover, the implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products to the extent that there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d minerals that can be used in our products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such minerals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. We may also encounter customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free. If we are not able to meet customer requirements, such customers may choose to not purchase our products, which could impact our sales.\nOur manufacturing processes, including the processes used by our suppliers, are also subject to numerous governmental regulations that cover both the use of various materials as well as environmental concerns. Since we and our suppliers operate on a global basis, maintaining compliance with regulations concerning our production processes is also a complex process that requires continual monitoring of regulations and ongoing compliance procedures. For example, environmental issues such as pollution and climate change have seen significant legislative and regulatory interest on a global basis. Changes in these areas could directly increase the cost of energy, which may have an impact on the way we or our suppliers manufacture products or use energy to produce our products. In addition, any new regulations or laws in the environmental area might increase the cost of raw materials we use in our products. We are currently unable to predict how any such changes will impact us and if any such impact could be material to our business. Any new law or regulation that significantly increases our costs of manufacturing or causes us or our suppliers to significantly alter the way that our products are manufactured would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLiabilities resulting from defects in or misuse of our products, whether or not covered by insurance, may delay our revenues and increase our liabilities and expenses.\nOur products are manufactured with highly complex electronic components and may, as a result, contain or may be alleged to contain errors or failures, including those relating to actual or potential security breaches. In addition, our customers or their installation partners may improperly install or implement our products, which could delay completion of a deployment or hinder our ability to win a subsequent award. Furthermore, because of the low cost and interoperable nature of our IIoT products, LONWORKS technology could be used in a manner for which it was not intended.\nEven if we determine that an alleged error or failure in our products does not exist, we may incur significant expense and shipments and revenues may be delayed while we analyze the alleged error or failure. If errors or failures are found in our products, we may not be able to successfully correct them in a timely manner, or at all, and our reputation may suffer. Such errors or failures could delay our product shipments and divert our engineering resources while we attempt to correct them. In addition, we could decide to extend the warranty period, or incur other costs outside of our normal warranty coverage, to help address any known\nerrors or failures in our products and mitigate the impact on our customers. For example, we could decide to replace defective products at a cost that is significantly higher than the value of the original products. This could delay our revenues and increase our expenses.\nTo address these issues, the agreements we maintain with our customers may contain provisions intended to limit our exposure to potential errors and omissions claims as well as any liabilities arising from them. However, our customer contracts may not effectively protect us against the liabilities and expenses associated with errors or failures attributable to our products.\nDefects in our products may also cause us to be liable for losses in the event of property damage, harm or death to persons, claims against our directors or officers, and the like. For example, our outdoor lighting control products operate in a variety of settings under diverse conditions that may present the risk of product failure, which could subject us to liability. For instance, a failure of our automated smart lighting product used by a customer to enhance security could subject us to liability in the event of unlawful activity by third parties. Moreover, our IIoT products may present risks beyond our control such as operational misuse that could ultimately subject us to liability. Such liabilities could harm our reputation, expose our company to liability, and adversely affect our operating results and financial position.\nTo help reduce our exposure to these types of liabilities, we currently maintain property, general commercial liability, errors and omissions, directors and officers, and other lines of insurance. However, it is possible that such insurance may not be available in the future or, if available, may be insufficient in amount to cover any particular claim, or we might not carry insurance that covers a specific claim. In addition, we believe that the premiums for the types of insurance we carry will continue to fluctuate from period to period. Significant cost increases could also result in increased premiums or reduced coverage limits. Consequently, if we elect to reduce our coverage, or if we do not carry insurance for a particular type of claim, we will face increased exposure to these types of claims.\nWe may be unable to realize the benefits of our net operating loss carry-forwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d).\nNOLs may be carried forward to offset federal and state taxable income in future years and eliminate income taxes otherwise payable on such taxable income, subject to certain adjustments. Based on current federal and state corporate income tax rates, our NOLs and other carry-forwards could provide a benefit to us, if fully utilized, of significant future tax savings. However, our ability to use these tax benefits in future years will depend upon the amount of our otherwise federal and state taxable income. If we do not have sufficient federal and state taxable income in future years to use the tax benefits before they expire, we will lose the benefit of these NOLs permanently. Consequently, in addition to dependence on the generation of future business profits, our ability to use the tax benefits associated with our substantial NOLs will depend significantly on our success in identifying suitable acquisition or investment candidates, and once identified, successfully consummating an acquisition of or investment in these candidates.\nAdditionally, federal NOLs are subject to annual limitations under the change of ownership rules within Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. In general, an ownership change occurs when the percentage of stock held by one or more 5-percent shareholders increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest stock ownership held by such shareholders at any time within a prescribed period, usually three years. If an ownership change were to occur, we may be unable to use a significant portion of our NOLs to offset taxable income. As discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, on April 22, 2016, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors adopted a Tax Benefit Preservation Plan (\u201cTax Plan\u201d) intended to reduce the likelihood that changes in the Company\u2019s investor base have the unintended effect of limiting the Company\u2019s use of its tax benefits. The Tax Plan is intended to require any person acquiring shares of the Company\u2019s securities equal to or exceeding 4.99% of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares to obtain the approval of the Board of Directors. This would protect the tax benefits because changes in ownership by a person owning less than 4.99% of the Company\u2019s stock are considered and included in one or more public groups in the calculation of \u201cownership change\u201d for purposes of Section 382 of the Code. However, there can be no assurance that the Tax Plan would be effective under all circumstances. Moreover, the Tax Plan will expire on April 25, 2017, unless renewed by our Board of Directors.\nThe amount of NOLs that we have claimed has not been audited or otherwise validated by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d). The IRS could challenge our calculation of the amount of our NOLs or our determinations as to when a prior change in ownership occurred, and other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code may limit our ability to carry forward our NOLs to offset taxable income in future years. If the IRS was successful with respect to any such challenge, the potential tax benefit of the NOLs to us could be substantially reduced.\nWe have limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights.\nOur success depends significantly upon our intellectual property rights, which can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to establish, maintain and protect these intellectual property rights, all of which afford only limited protection, particularly in those countries that lack robust or accessible enforcement mechanisms. For example, we have in the past and may in the future form joint ventures with foreign companies, including those in China, where intellectual property mechanisms are generally less stringent than those found in the U.S. We have also outsourced certain development activities to third parties. If any of our patents fail to protect our technology, or if we do not obtain patents in certain countries, our competitors may find it easier to offer equivalent or superior technology. In addition, our trade secrets or other intellectual property that we license to third parties could be used improperly or otherwise in violation of the license terms.\nWe have also registered or applied for registration for certain trademarks, and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate. If we fail to properly register or maintain our trademarks, or to otherwise take all necessary steps to protect our trademarks, the value associated with the trademarks may diminish. In addition, if we fail to protect our trade secrets or other intellectual property rights, we may not be able to compete as effectively in our markets.\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or services or use information that we regard as proprietary, or it may not be economically feasible to enforce them. Any of our patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, or intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, we cannot assure you that we have taken or will take all necessary steps to protect our intellectual property rights. Third parties may also independently develop similar technology without breach of our trade secrets or other proprietary rights. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries, including several in which we operate or sell our products, do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States, and it may take longer to receive a remedy from a court outside of the United States. Also, some of our products are licensed under shrink-wrap license agreements that are not signed by licensees and therefore may not be binding under the laws of certain jurisdictions.\nFrom time to time, litigation may be necessary to defend and enforce our proprietary rights. As a result, we could incur substantial costs and divert management resources, which could harm our business, regardless of the final outcome. Despite our efforts to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights both in the United States and abroad, we may be unsuccessful in doing so. Also, the steps that we take to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights may be inadequate to deter third parties from infringing, misusing, misappropriating, or independently developing our technology or intellectual property rights, or to prevent an unauthorized third party from misappropriating our products or technology.\nOur business may suffer if it is alleged or found that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others, or if we are unable to secure rights to use the intellectual property rights of others on reasonable terms.\nWe may be contractually obligated to indemnify our customers or other third parties that use our products in the event our products are alleged to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. From time to time, we may also receive notice that a third party believes that our products may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of that third party. Responding to those claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, and cause us to incur significant expenses. We do not insure against infringement of a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights.\nAs the result of such a claim, we may elect or be required to redesign our products that are alleged to infringe the third party\u2019s patents or other intellectual property rights, which could cause those product offerings to be delayed. Or we could be required to cease distributing those products altogether. In the alternative, we could seek a license to the third party\u2019s intellectual property. Even if our products do not infringe, we may elect to take a license or settle to avoid incurring litigation costs. However, it is possible that we would not be able to obtain such a license or settle on reasonable terms, or at all.\nIn some cases, even though no infringement has been alleged, we may attempt to secure rights to use the intellectual property rights of others that would be useful to us. We cannot guarantee that we would be able to secure such rights on reasonable terms, or at all.\nLastly, our customers may not purchase our products if they are concerned our products may infringe third party intellectual property rights. This could reduce the market opportunity for the sale of our products and services.\nAny of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe face currency risks associated with our international operations.\nWe have operations located in seven countries and our products are sold in many more countries around the world. Revenues from international sales, which include both export sales and sales by international subsidiaries, accounted for about 68.2%, 71.3% and 72.4%, of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. We expect that international sales will continue to constitute a significant portion of our total revenues. Given our high dependency on sales of our products into Europe, the ongoing financial crisis in that region, which may be adversely impacted by the \"Brexit\" vote in the United Kingdom, could adversely affect our financial results.\nChanges in the value of currencies in which we conduct our business relative to the U.S. dollar have caused and could continue to cause fluctuations in our reported financial results. The three primary areas where we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations are revenues, cost of goods sold, and operating expenses.\nIn general, we sell our products to foreign customers primarily in U.S. dollars. As such, fluctuations in exchange rates have had, and could continue to have, an impact on revenues. If the value of the dollar rises, our products will become more expensive to our foreign customers, which could result in their decision to postpone or cancel a planned purchase.\nWith respect to the relatively minimal amount of our revenues generated in foreign currencies, our historical foreign currency exposure has been related primarily to the Japanese Yen and has not been material to our consolidated results of operations. However, we will face increased exposure to foreign currency risk if, in the future, our foreign customers require us to price our products in a local currency.\nIn addition, for our cost of goods sold, our products are generally assembled by CEMs in China. Although our transactions with these companies are presently denominated in U.S. dollars, in the future they may require us to pay in their local currency, or demand a U.S. dollar price adjustment or other payment to address a change in exchange rates, which would increase our cost to procure our products. This is particularly a risk in China, where any future revaluations of the Chinese currency against the U.S. dollar could result in significant cost increases. In addition, increases in labor costs in the markets where our products are manufactured could also result in higher costs to procure our products. For example, China has recently experienced overall wage increases, which our CEMs have generally passed along to us.\nWe use the local currency to pay for our operating expenses in the various countries where we have operations. If the value of the U.S. dollar declines as compared to the local currency where the expenses are incurred, our expenses, when translated back into U.S. dollars, will increase.\nTo date, we have not hedged any of our foreign currency exposures and currently do not maintain any hedges to mitigate our foreign currency risks. Consequently, any resulting adverse foreign currency fluctuations could significantly harm our revenues, cost of goods sold, or operating expenses.\nFluctuations in our operating results may cause our stock price to decline.\nOur quarterly and annual results have varied significantly from period to period, and we have sometimes failed to meet market expectations. Moreover, we have a history of losses and negative cash flow and cannot assure you that we will achieve sustained profitability in the future. Our future operating results will depend on many factors, many of which are outside of our control, including the following:\n\u2022\norders may be cancelled;\n\u2022\nthe mix of products and services that we sell may change to a less profitable mix;\n\u2022\nshipment, payment schedules, and product acceptance may be delayed;\n\u2022\nour products may not be purchased by OEMs, systems integrators, service providers and end-users at the levels we project;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop products that comply with future regulations and trade association guidelines;\n\u2022\nthe revenue recognition rules relating to certain of our products could require us to defer some or all of the revenue associated with product shipments until certain conditions, such as delivery and acceptance criteria for our software and/or hardware products, are met in a future period;\n\u2022\nour CEMs may not be able to provide quality products on a timely basis, especially during periods where capacity in the CEM market is limited;\n\u2022\nour products may not be manufactured in accordance with specifications or our established quality standards, or may not perform as designed;\n\u2022\ndownturns in any customer\u2019s or potential customer\u2019s business, or declines in general economic conditions, could cause significant reductions in capital spending, thereby reducing the levels of orders from our customers;\n\u2022\nwe may incur costs associated with any future business acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nany future impairment charges related to our intangible assets that are required to be recorded under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States may negatively affect our earnings and financial condition.\nAny of the above factors could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe may be unable to anticipate or fail to adequately mitigate against increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal or fraudulent activities against us.\nDespite any defensive measures we take to manage threats to our business, our risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of such threats in light of advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, new and sophisticated methods used by criminals including phishing, social engineering or other illicit acts, or other events or developments that we may be unable to anticipate or fail to adequately mitigate. If such efforts against us were to be successful, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFuture acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships or alliances could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of management, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nAs opportunities present themselves, we may from time to time evaluate and enter into strategic partnerships or transactions involving acquisitions of or investments in other businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our services, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential transactions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable opportunities, whether or not transactions are ultimately completed. If we acquire businesses, we may not be able to integrate successfully the acquired personnel, operations and technologies, or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We may not be able to find and identify desirable opportunities or be successful in entering into an agreement with respect to the opportunities that we do identify. Acquisitions and other transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities, use of our existing cash reserves or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if a transaction fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business and financial condition may suffer.\nNatural disasters, power outages, and other factors outside of our control such as widespread pandemics could disrupt our business.\nWe must protect our business and our network infrastructure against damage from earthquake, flood, hurricane and similar events, as well as from power outages. A natural disaster, power outage, or other unanticipated problem could also adversely affect our business by, among other things, harming our primary data center or other internal operations, limiting our ability to communicate with our customers, limiting our ability or our partners\u2019 or customers\u2019 ability to sell or use our products, affecting our third party developer\u2019s ability to complete developments on schedule or at all, or affecting our suppliers\u2019 ability to provide us with components or products. For example, the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan adversely impacted our revenues from customers located in Japan and/or our ability to source parts from companies located in Japan. Shortly after the earthquake, we received notice from Toshiba (one of two manufacturers of the Neuron Chip - an important component that we and our customers use in control network devices), that they would no longer be able to manufacture Neuron Chips due to earthquake damage suffered at the semiconductor manufacturing facility that produced the Neuron Chips. However, the abrupt termination of Toshiba\u2019s Neuron Chip manufacturing capability caused a disruption in supply and an increase in prices from the remaining supplier, Cypress Semiconductor. We do not insure against several natural disasters, including earthquakes.\nAny outbreak of a widespread communicable disease pandemic, such as the outbreak of the H1N1 influenza virus in 2009, could similarly impact our operations. Such impact could include, among other things, the inability for our sales and operations personnel located in affected regions to travel and conduct business freely, the impact any such disease may have on one or more of the distributors for our products in those regions, and increased supply chain costs. Additionally, any future health-related disruptions at our third-party contract manufacturers or other key suppliers could affect our ability to supply our customers with products in a timely manner, which would harm our results of operations.", "PERMNO": 86260, "SIC": 3576, "TIC": "ELON"}
