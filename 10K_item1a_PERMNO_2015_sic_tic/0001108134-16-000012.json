RISK FACTORS\nThe risks set forth below, in addition to the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition to the risks set forth below and the other risks described in this annual report, there may also be additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. As a result, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors set forth below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us.\nOverall Business Risks\nThe Company\u2019s Business May Be Adversely Affected by Conditions in the Financial Markets and Economic Conditions Generally and Locally.\nNational and international markets continue to recover from the aftermath of the severe recession. Numerous fiscal and monetary policy measures address the evolving conditions related to the uneven conditions of economic and financial recovery. National and international economic and financial events pose risks to the financial services industry and to the Company and its markets. A deterioration of business and economic conditions, particularly in our local markets, could adversely affect the credit quality of the Company\u2019s loans, results of operations and financial condition.\nLending\nDeterioration in the Housing Sector, Commercial Real Estate, and Related Markets May Adversely Affect Business and Financial Results.\nReal estate lending is a major business activity for the Company. Real estate market conditions affect the value and marketability of real estate collateral, and they also affect the cash flows, liquidity, and net worth of many borrowers whose operations and finances depend on real estate market conditions. Adverse conditions in our market areas could reduce our growth rate, affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans and generally affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s Emphasis on Commercial Lending May Expose the Company to Increased Lending Risks, Which Could Hurt Profits.\nBerkshire plans to continue to emphasize the origination of commercial loans, which generally exposes us to a greater risk of nonpayment and loss because repayment of such loans often depends on the successful operations and income stream of the borrowers. Commercial loans are historically more sensitive to economic downturns. Such sensitivity includes potentially higher default rates and possible reduction of collateral values. Commercial lending involves larger loan sizes and larger relationship exposures, which can have a greater impact on profits in the event of adverse loan performance. The majority of the Company\u2019s commercial loans are secured by real estate and subject to the previously discussed real estate risk factors. Commercial lending sometimes involves construction or other development financing, which is dependent on the future success of new operations. The Company\u2019s commercial lending activities have extended across wider parts of its New England and New York markets into areas where the Company has less business experience. The Company\u2019s commercial lending includes asset based lending, which depends on the Company\u2019s processes for monitoring and being able to liquidate collateral on which these loans rely. The Company has expanded and re-engineered its small business loan origination process in order to accelerate growth. The acquisition of Firestone Financial and the pending acquisition of 44 Business Capital expand the Company\u2019s commercial lending outside of the Northeast and involve customers and business operations more removed from its traditional customer base and operating organization. Additionally, the Company has expanded its wholesale purchases and sales of loans and loan participations with other banks doing business in its markets, including participations in national credits. Commercial loans may increase as a percentage of total loans, and commercial lending may continue to expose the company to increased risks.\nThe Allowance for Loan Losses May Prove to be Insufficient to Absorb Losses in The Loan Portfolio.\nLike all financial institutions, the Company maintains an allowance for loan losses which is its estimate of the probable losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio as of the financial statement date. The allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses, and future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect operating results. The accounting measurements related to impairment and the loan loss allowance require significant estimates which are subject to uncertainty and changes relating to new information and changing circumstances. Additionally, the allowance can only reflect\nthose losses which are reasonably estimable. Accordingly, at any time, there may be probable losses inherent in the portfolio but which are not reasonably estimable until additional information emerges which can form the basis for a reasonable estimate.\nState and federal regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses through additional provisions for loan losses charged to expense, or to decrease the allowance for loan losses through loan charge-offs, net of recoveries. Any such additional provisions for loan losses or charge-offs, as required by these regulatory agencies, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEstimates Related to Accounting for Acquired Loans May Differ From Actual Results.\nUnder generally accepted principles for business combinations, there is no loan loss allowance initially recorded for acquired loans, which are recorded at net fair value on the acquisition date. This net fair value generally includes embedded loss estimates for acquired loans with deteriorated credit quality. These estimates are based on projections of expected cash flows for these problem loans, which in many cases rely on estimates deriving from the liquidation of collateral. If the projections are inadequate, the fair value estimates may exceed the actual collectability of the balances, and this may result in the related loans being considered by Berkshire as impaired, which would result in a reduction in interest income. The tangible book value recorded by the Company is based in part on these estimates, and if fair value estimates differ from actual collectability and subsequent earnings may differ from original estimates. Measures of tangible book value and earnings impacts of business combinations are frequently used in evaluating the merits and value of business combinations. The Company has recorded significant income resulting from collections of acquired impaired loans which exceeded the fair value estimates originally established. Additionally, accounting for acquired loans involves ongoing assessments of the timing and amount of expected loan collections. Numerous assumptions and estimates are integral to purchased loan accounting, and actual results could be different from prior estimates.\nNew Regulations Could Restrict the Company\u2019s Ability to Originate and Sell Mortgage Loans.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\") issued a rule designed to clarify for lenders how they can avoid monetary damages under the Dodd-Frank Act, which would hold lenders accountable for ensuring a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a mortgage. Loans that meet this \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d definition will be presumed to have complied with the new ability-to-repay standard. The CFPB\u2019s rule on qualified mortgages could limit our ability or desire to make certain types of loans or loans to certain borrowers, or could make it more expensive and/or time consuming to make these loans, which could limit our growth or profitability.\nOperating\nExpansion, Growth, and Acquisitions Could Negatively Impact Earnings If Not Successful.\nThe Company plans to achieve significant growth organically, by geographic expansion, through business line expansion, and through acquisitions. We have recently expanded into new geographic markets and anticipate that we will continue to expand into additional geographic markets as we grow. The success of this expansion depends on our ability to continue to maintain and develop an infrastructure appropriate to support and integrate such growth. Also, success depends on the acceptance by customers of us and our services in these new markets and, in the case of expansion through acquisitions, our success depends on many factors, including the long-term recruitment and retention of key personnel and acquired customer relationships. The profitability of our expansion strategy also depends on whether the income we generate in the new markets will offset the increased expenses of operating a larger entity with increased personnel, more branch locations and additional product offerings. In 2013, revenues decreased in the second half of the year due to changes related to loans and operations acquired in the prior two years. The Company has implemented certain expense restructuring activities, related in part to the rationalization of acquired operations. Such activities expose us to risk that revenues may be affected or that changes in operations may result in inefficiencies or control deficiencies that could contribute to financial or market share losses.\nBerkshire continues to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand through acquisition of banks, branches, finance companies, insurance agencies, and wealth management firms. Some of these opportunities could result in further geographic expansion. Merger and acquisition activities are subject to a number of risks, including lending, operating, and integration risks. Growth through acquisition requires careful due diligence, evaluation of risks, and projections of future operations and financial conditions. Actual results may differ from our expectations and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Growth through acquisition also often involves the negotiation and execution of extensive merger agreements. Such agreements may give rise to litigation, constrain us in certain ways, or expose us to other risks beyond our normal operating risks.\nThe Company has recruited executive and business line management to support its growth and expansion, and it has absorbed management of acquired operations. The integration of new management exposes the Company to retention risks, operating\nrisks, and financial risks. Such recruitment can affect the retention of new and old business, and can also be affected by competitive reactions and other relationship risks in retaining accounts.\nRegulatory examinations of existing and acquired operations may result in the identification of certain operating matters requiring remediation, undisclosed deficiencies related to regulatory compliance, deficiencies that arise as a result of integration of acquired operations and operating activities conducted by those operations subsequent to the merger date, or impacts on existing business operations which are being integrated with the acquired operations. Any identified deficiencies related to regulatory compliance may result in changes that affect operating revenues and costs, including the scope or scale of business activities and/or potential future expansion initiatives. As a privately held company, Firestone was not recently subject to bank regulatory supervision and the integration of its operations required additional compliance initiatives for existing and acquired operations. Due to the pending acquisition agreement for the operations of 44 Business Capital, which is an SBA preferred lender operating in the mid-Atlantic, additional compliance activities are anticipated to integrate these operations.\nCompetition From Financial Institutions and Other Financial Service Providers May Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Growth and Profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. Larger banking institutions have substantially greater resources and lending limits and may offer certain services that we do not. Local competitors with excess capital may accept lower returns on new business. There is increased competition by out-of-market competitors through the internet and mobile technology. Federal regulations and financial support programs may in some cases favor competitors. Competition includes competition for banking teams and talent. Competition creates risk that revenues, earnings, or market share could be adversely affected by the loss of talent.\nMarket Changes May Adversely Affect Demand For The Company\u2019s Services and Impact Revenue, Costs, and Earnings.\nChannels for servicing the Company\u2019s customers are evolving rapidly, with less reliance on traditional branch facilities, more use of online and mobile banking, and demand for universal bankers and other relationship managers who can service multiple product lines. The Company has an ongoing process for evaluating the profitability of its branch system and other office and operational facilities. The identification of unprofitable operations and facilities can lead to restructuring charges and introduce the risk of disruptions to revenues and customer relationships. The Company competes with larger providers who are rapidly evolving their service channels and escalating the costs of evolving the service process.\nThe Company is Subject to Security and Operational Risks Relating to Our Use of Technology that Could Damage Our Reputation and Our Business.\nSecurity breaches of confidential information in our internet and mobile banking activities could expose us to possible liability and damage our reputation. Any compromise of our data security could also deter customers from using our internet banking services. We rely on industry standard internet security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data. These precautions may not protect our security systems from compromises or breaches and could result in damage to our reputation and our business. We utilize third party core banking software and for some systems we have outsourced our data processing to a third party. If our third party providers encounter difficulties or if we have difficulty in communicating and/or transmitting with such third parties, it could significantly affect our ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions, which could significantly affect our business operations. We utilize file encryption in designated internal systems and networks and are subject to certain state and federal regulations regarding how we manage data security. Our enterprise governance risk and compliance function includes a framework of controls, policies and technologies to monitor and protect information from cyberattacks, mishandling, and loss, together with safeguards related to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. Natural disasters and disaster recovery risks could affect our operating systems, which could affect our reputation. Our business continuity program addresses crisis management, business impact, and data and systems recovery. Potential problems with the management of technology security and operational risks may affect regulatory compliance, which could affect operating costs and expansion plans.\nThe Company Faces Cybersecurity Risks, Including Denial of Service Attacks, Hacking and Identity Theft that Could Result in the Disclosure of Confidential Information, Which Could Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Business or Reputation and Create Significant Legal and Financial Exposure.\nThe Company\u2019s computer systems and network infrastructure are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities or identity theft. Financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means. Denial of service attacks have been launched against a number of large financial services institutions. As a growing regional bank, the Company anticipates that it may be subject to similar attacks in the future. Hacking and\nidentity theft risks could cause serious reputational harm to the Company. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and the Company may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks.\nThe Company may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize these risks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss. Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems, the Company will not be able to anticipate all security breaches of these types, and the Company may not be able to implement effective preventive measures against such security breaches. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of the Company\u2019s systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to its data or that of its clients.\nThese risks may increase in the future as the Company continues to increase its mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expands its internal usage of web-based products and applications. A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause serious negative consequences to the Company, including significant disruption of operations, misappropriation of confidential information of the Company or that of its customers, or damage to computers or systems of the Company or those of its customers and counterparties. A security breach could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to the Company or to its customers, loss of confidence in the Company\u2019s security measures, significant litigation exposure, and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nFinancial and Operating Counterparties Expose the Company to Risks.\nWe have increased our use of derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, which exposes us to financial and contractual risks with counterparty banks. We maintain correspondent bank relationships, manage certain loan participations, engage in securities transactions, and engage in other activities with financial counterparties that are customary to our industry. We also utilize services from major vendors of technology, telecommunications, and other essential operating services. There is financial and operating risk in these relationships, which we seek to manage through internal controls and procedures, but there are no assurances that we will not experience loss or interruption of our business as a result of unforeseen events with these providers. Our expanded mortgage lending and mortgage banking operations have also exposed us to more counterparty transactions including the use of third parties to participate in the management of interest rate risk and mortgage sales and hedging. Financial and operational risks are inherent in these counterparty relationships.\nThe Company May Not Be Able to Attract and Retain Skilled People.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract new employees, retain and motivate our existing employees, and continue to compensate employees competitively. Competition for the best people in our industry can be intense and we may not be able to hire or retain appropriately qualified individuals. As a result of recent revenue declines and expense restructuring activities, the Company could experience challenges in the retention of existing employees.\nControls and Procedures May Fail or Be Circumvented.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates the Company\u2019s internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRetail Lending Changes Expose the Company to Operating Risks.\nVolatile conditions in mortgage markets have been reflected in changes in the Company\u2019s mortgage operations. The Company has expanded its recruitment and re-engineered its mortgage banking activities (including a systems conversion) and changed its management of this function. Similarly, consumer indirect auto lending has varied between high growth and declines in a short amount of time. In 2015, the Company recruited new indirect auto lending leadership. These changes expose us to operating risks and expose the Bank to the risk of loan losses, losses related to interest rate risk management, compliance, litigation, and other risks common in consumer lending operations.\nDerivatives and Counterparty Risks Have Increased.\nBerkshire could experience losses if there are failures in the controls or accounting for these activities or if there are performance failures by any of these new counterparties. The risk of loss is increased when interest rates change suddenly and if the intended hedging objectives are not achieved as a result of market or counterparty behaviors. The sudden change in interest rates in 2013 contributed to lower mortgage banking profitability in 2013.\nLiquidity\nOur Wholesale Funding Sources May Prove Insufficient to Replace Deposits at Maturity and Support Our Operations and Future Growth.\nWe must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. As a part of our liquidity management, we use a number of funding sources in addition to deposit growth and repayments and maturities of loans and investments. These sources include Federal Home Loan Bank advances, proceeds from the sale of loans, and liquidity resources at the holding company. Most recently, the Company has expanded its use of brokered deposits both to support ongoing growth and to provide enhanced deposit insurance to support large dollar commercial relationships. Our financial flexibility will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable costs. Finally, if we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs. In this case, our operating margins and profitability would be adversely affected. Turbulence in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the willingness of certain counterparties and customers to do business with us.\nOur Ability to Service Our Debt, Pay Dividends and Otherwise Pay Our Obligations as They Come Due Is Substantially Dependent on Capital Distributions from the Bank, and These Distributions Are Subject to Regulatory Limits and Other Restrictions.\nA substantial source of our holding company income is the receipt of dividends from the Bank, from which we service our debt, pay our obligations, and pay shareholder dividends. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank and other factors, that the applicable regulatory authorities could assert that payment of dividends or other types of payments are an unsafe or unsound practice. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to service our debt, pay our obligations or pay dividends on our common stock. The inability to receive dividends from the Bank would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nInterest Rates\nChanges in Interest Rates Could Adversely Affect Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nNet interest income is our largest source of income. Changes in interest rates can affect the level of net interest income. The Company\u2019s interest rate sensitivity is discussed in more detail in Item 7A of this report. The Company principally manages interest rate risk by managing its volume and mix of earning assets and funding liabilities. In a changing interest rate environment, the Company may not be able to manage this risk effectively. If the Company is unable to manage interest rate risk effectively, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed. Changes in interest rates can also affect the demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, and the supply conditions in the U.S. financial and capital markets. Changes in the level of interest rates may negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to originate real estate loans, the value of its assets and its ability to realize gains from the sale of our assets, all of which ultimately affect our earnings.\nSecurities Market Values\nDeclines in the Value of Certain Investment Securities Could Require Write-Downs, Which Would Reduce Our Earnings.\nUnrealized losses on investment securities result from changes in credit spreads and liquidity issues in the marketplace, along with changes in the credit profile of individual securities issuers. A continued decline in the value of these securities or other factors could result in an other-than-temporary impairment write-down which would reduce earnings. The Company has increased its investment in equity securities and non-investment grade debt securities which may exhibit more credit risk and price volatility. Some of the Company\u2019s securities are locally originated economic development bonds. These securities could become impaired due to economic and real estate market conditions which also affect loan risk. The Company has an investment in the stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston. If the capitalization of a Federal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLBB\"), including the FHLBB, became substantially diminished it could result in a write-down which would reduce our earnings. Future regulatory pronouncements could affect the securities portfolio and its carrying value.\nTaxation\nChanges in Tax Preference Items May Affect Results of Operations.\nThe Company\u2019s effective income tax rate is lower than the statutory rate. The benefit of tax preference items increased in 2015, primarily due to the Bank\u2019s increased equity ownership in investment tax credit entities as an aspect of its overall operating and financial strategy for building customer relationships, supporting its communities, and contributing to profitability. These investments are discussed below in the Income Tax Expense section of Item 7. The availability of these benefits depends on federal and state tax legislation and on rulings by taxing authorities. Additionally, the availability of these investments depends\non the qualifying supply of eligible projects and their utility to the Company depends on risk management and regulatory factors. The Company expects that tax preference items will contribute less benefit to its future effective tax rate due to increased pre-tax profits as a result of its growth. Higher tax expense due to planned or unplanned changes in tax preference items may result in lower profitability. Quarterly results depend on the timing of investments and accounting principles for income tax expense recognition, and quarterly results may vary significantly from annual results.\nRegulatory\nLegislative and Regulatory Initiatives May Affect Business Activities and Increase Operating Costs.\nThe potential exists for additional federal or state laws and regulations regarding lending, funding practices, capital, and liquidity standards. Bank regulatory agencies are expected to be more active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, including the expected issuance of many formal enforcement orders. In addition, new laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes may also increase our compliance costs and affect our business and operations. Moreover, the FDIC sets the cost of our FDIC insurance premiums, which can affect our profitability.\nThe Company is required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. Regulatory capital requirements and their impact on the Company may change. It may need to raise additional capital in the future to support operations and continued growth. Our ability to raise capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and on our financial performance. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, it could affect operations and the execution of the strategic plan, which includes further expanding operations through internal growth and acquisitions.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act made extensive changes in the regulation of insured depository institutions. In addition to eliminating the OTS and creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, directed changes in the way that institutions are assessed for deposit insurance, mandated the imposition of more rigorous consolidated capital requirements on savings and loan holding companies, required originators of certain securitized loans to retain a percentage of the risk for the transferred loans, stipulated regulatory rate-setting for certain debit card interchange fees, repealed restrictions on the payment of interest on commercial demand deposits, and contained a number of reforms related to mortgage originations. The impact of many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act is ongoing as further regulations are promulgated. The Company expects that the Dodd-Frank Act will, at a minimum, result in increased regulatory burden, compliance costs and interest expense for the Company. New laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes, along with negative developments in the financial industry and the domestic and international credit markets, may significantly affect the markets in which the Company does business, the markets for and value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. For more information, see \u201cRegulation and Supervision\u201d in Item 1 of this report.\nThe Short-term and Long-term Impact of the Changing Regulatory Capital Requirements and New Capital Rules is Uncertain.\nThe federal banking agencies have adopted proposals that have substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bank and the Company. The amendments implemented the \u201cBasel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The new rules apply regulatory capital requirements to both the Bank and the consolidated Company. The amended rules included new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective in January 2015, with certain requirements to be phased in beginning in 2016, and refined the definition of what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for purposes of calculating those ratios.\nThe new minimum capital level requirements applicable to the Bank and the Company include: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions. The amended rules also establish a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum capital ratios, and would result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.\nThe Basel III changes and other regulatory capital requirements will result in generally higher regulatory capital standards. The application of more stringent capital requirements to the Bank and the consolidated Company could, among other things, result in lower returns on invested capital, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the\nimplementation of Basel III could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding, restructure our business models, and/or increase our holdings of liquid assets. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital and/or additional capital conservation buffers could result in management modifying its business strategy and could further limit our ability to make distributions, including paying out dividends or buying back shares.\nProvisions of Our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, and Delaware Law, as Well as State and Federal Banking Regulations, Could Delay or Prevent a Takeover of Us by a Third Party.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the corporate law of the State of Delaware, and state and federal regulations could delay, defer or prevent a third party from acquiring us, despite the possible benefit to our stockholders, or otherwise adversely affect the price of our common stock. These provisions include: limitations on voting rights of beneficial owners of more than 10 percent of our common stock; supermajority voting requirements for certain business combinations; the election of directors to staggered terms of three years; and advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors and for proposing matters that stockholders may act on at stockholder meetings. In addition, we are subject to Delaware laws, including one that prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date the person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met. These provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our Board.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nAcquisitions Have Resulted in Significant Goodwill, Which if it Becomes Impaired Would be Required to be Written Down, Resulting in a Negative Impact on Earnings.\nThe initial recording and subsequent impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets requires subjective judgments about the estimates of the fair value of assets acquired. Factors that may significantly affect the estimates include specific industry or market sector conditions, changes in revenue growth trends, customer behavior, competitive forces, cost structures and changes in discount rates. It is possible that future impairment testing could result in an impairment of the value of goodwill or intangible assets, or both. If we determine impairment exists at a given point in time, our earnings and the book value of the related intangible asset(s) will be reduced by the amount of the impairment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the results of impairment testing on goodwill and adjusted deposit intangible assets have no impact on our tangible book value or regulatory capital levels. These are non-GAAP financial measures. They are not a substitute for GAAP measures and should only be considered in conjunction with the Company\u2019s GAAP financial information.\nTrading of our Common Stock\nThe Trading History of The Company\u2019s Common Stock Is Characterized By Low Trading Volume. The Value of Your Investment May be Subject To Sudden Decreases Due To the Volatility of the Price of Our Common Stock.\nThe level of interest and trading in the Company\u2019s stock depends on many factors beyond our control. The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the factors discussed in other risk factors and the following: actual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results; changes in interest rates; changes in the legal or regulatory environment; press releases, announcements or publicity relating to the Company or its competitors or relating to trends in its industry; changes in expectations as to future financial performance, including financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts and investors; future sales of our common stock; changes in economic conditions in our marketplace, general conditions in the U.S. economy, financial markets or the banking industry; and other developments affecting our competitors or us. These factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance, and could prevent stockholders from selling their common stock at a desirable price.\nIn the past, stockholders have brought securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. We could be the target of similar litigation in the future, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nRecent Mergers\nRecent Merger Activity May Create Unforeseen Risks For the Bank and the Company.\nThe Company previously reported risk factors related to the acquisitions of Hampden and Firestone. While these business combinations have been completed, the Company continues to manage the business, compliance, and control risks of these recently acquired operations. The Company has a pending agreement to acquire the business operation of 44 Business Capital. The Company expects to complete this acquisition in the first quarter of 2016 and the consummation of this acquisition will expose the Company to risk factors similar to those related to Hampden and Firestone, including achieving the targeted benefits and investment returns. If this acquisition is not completed, the Company may face risks related to liabilities arising from the failure to complete the merger agreement and disruption of its business plans for expanding its operations and earnings.", "PERMNO": 88280, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BHLB"}
