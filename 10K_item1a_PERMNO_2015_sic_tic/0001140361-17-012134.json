In addition to the risks described below, there may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial that may become material risks. Any of these risks could materially affect our businesses, financial condition or results of operations. In such case, you may lose all or part of your original investment.\nWe have incurred substantial operating losses in the past and we may not be able to achieve profitability in the future.\nHistorically, since inception in 2007 and through 2014, we have incurred net losses. We started to report net income in 2015. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded net income of $2.2 million and $1.2 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had cash inflows from operations of $3.3 million and $3.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $98.8 million and $101.0 million, respectively. We expect development, sales and other operating expenses to increase in the future as we expand our business. If our revenue does not grow to offset these current expenses, we may not be profitable. In fact, in future quarters we may not have any revenue growth and our revenues could decline. Furthermore, if our operating expenses exceed expectations, financial performance will be adversely affected and we may continue to incur significant losses in the future.\nWe face intense competition and expect competition to increase in the future, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue, revenue growth rate, if any, and market share.\nThe global semiconductor market, in general, is highly competitive. Increased competition could result in price pressure, reduced profitability and loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, revenue, revenue growth rates and operating results. We compete in different target markets to various degrees on the basis of a number of principal competitive factors, including our products\u2019 performance, features and functionality, energy efficiency, size, ease of system design, customer support, products, reputation, reliability, price and the quality of our product roadmap. We expect competition to increase and intensify as more and larger semiconductor companies, as well as the internal resources of large, integrated original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, enter our markets.\nAlthough we believe we currently compete favorably with our competitors, we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully against either current or new competitors in the future. Our competitors range from large, international companies offering a wide range of semiconductor products to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets and internal engineering groups within device manufacturers, some of which may be our customers. Some of our competitors which are large public companies have longer operating histories and greater financial, technical, marketing resources than we have. Our primary competitors include Qorvo, Vitesse, Oki, Inphi, M/A-Com, Semtech, Microsemi, Broadcom Limited (via their merger with Avago), Finisar, MaxLinear, TE Connectivity (formerly Zarlink), Mellanox and Ambarella. We expect competition in the markets in which we participate to increase in the future as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings. In addition, we believe that a number of other public and private companies are in the process of developing competing products for various broadband communications applications. Because our products often are \u201cbuilding block\u201d semiconductors which provide functions that in some cases can be integrated into more complex integrated circuits, we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits, some of which may be existing customers that develop their own integrated circuit products.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control, including industry and general economic trends. During past periods of downturns in our industry, competition in the markets in which we operate intensified as manufacturers of semiconductors reduced prices in order to combat production overcapacity and high inventory levels. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to withstand similar adverse economic or market conditions in the future. Moreover, the competitive landscape is changing as a result of consolidation within our industry as some of our competitors have merged with or been acquired by other competitors, and other competitors have begun to collaborate with each other. These developments may materially and adversely affect our current and future target markets and our ability to compete successfully in those markets.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers and the loss of one or more of these key customers, the diminished demand for our products from a key customer, or the failure to obtain certifications from a key customer or its distribution channel could significantly reduce our revenue and profits.\nA relatively small number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenue in any particular period. One or more of our key customers may discontinue operations as a result of consolidation, liquidation or otherwise, or reduce significantly its business with us due to the current economic conditions or their current situation. Reductions, delays and cancellation of orders from our key customers or the loss of one or more key customers could significantly reduce our revenue and profits. There is no assurance that our current customers will continue to place orders with us, that orders by existing customers will continue at current or historical levels or that we will be able to obtain orders from new customers.\nFurthermore, as part of our strategy, we market and sell our products through third-party distributors in certain markets such as China, Taiwan and Japan where the ability to make sales to end-user customers is dependent upon such channels. Although we develop relationships with distributors in these markets that further our sales efforts, we do not control the activities of our distributors with respect to the marketing and sale of our products. Therefore, the reputation and performance of our distributors and their ability and willingness to sell our products, uphold our brand reputation, and expand their businesses and sales channels are essential to the growth of our business in these markets. Similarly, factors which are under our control, such as the development of our products, are essential to the growth of our business in these markets. Consistent with our relationship with individual customers, we do not have long-term purchase commitments from these distributor customers, and certain distributor agreements provide for semi-annual stock rotation privileges of 5 to 10 percent of net sales for the previous six-month period. As product sales have continued to grow in Asia, primarily in China and Taiwan, the distributors in those markets are making sales to multiple end-user customers. Maintaining distributors in these markets is necessary to our ability to make sales in such jurisdictions, however, due to the nature of our customer relationships with the distributors and the structure of the distribution market, it is possible to cease business operations with any particular distributor and put in place an alternative distribution arrangement without materially impacting our sales, provided we have an appropriately planned transition. However, we cannot provide assurances that we can adequately plan for all such needs to replace any of our distributors in these markets, or that any changes will not result in delay of shipment of our product or disruptions of distribution arrangements in the future, and loss of a key distributor could have an adverse effect on our business, revenue and operating results.\nIn addition, certain end-user customers in the United States do not make direct purchases of our products from us. Rather, purchases are made by distributors that are engaged by the end-user customers to manage their long-term inventory needs. Unlike the distributors we engage, these distributors have no stock rotation rights and, in some cases, may pay in advance of shipment. Since purchase commitments are dependent upon the purchasing decisions of the end-user customers supported by these distributors, there are no long-term purchase commitments necessary from these distributor customers, and the risks that exist with individual customers apply equally to these customer relationships.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, there were no customers or distributors who accounted for 10% or more of total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2015, one customer, Alcatel-Lucent, now Nokia, and three distributors, Pangaea (H.K.) Limited, in China, 3A, Inc., in the United States, and Litrax Technology Co., Ltd, in Taiwan, accounted for 23%, 16%, 11% and 10% of our total revenue, respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue.\nAverage selling prices of our products could decrease rapidly, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and gross margins.\nWe may experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices. From time to time, we have reduced the average unit price of our products in anticipation of competitive pricing pressures, new product introductions by us or our competitors and for other reasons. We expect that we will have to do so again in the future. If we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes or introducing new products with higher operating margins, our revenue and gross margins will suffer. To maintain our gross margins, we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our and our customers\u2019 costs. Failure to do so could cause our revenue and gross margins to decline.\nThere may be a possible effect from the acquisition of Magnum on our future revenue recognition policy.\nHistorically, one of the primary revenue recognition models used by Magnum is to recognize license royalty revenue based upon reports received by customers during the quarter, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. The customers generally report shipment information typically within 45 days following the end of their respective quarters. If there is a reliable basis upon which we can estimate royalty revenue prior to obtaining the customers\u2019 reports, we will recognize the royalty revenues in the quarter in which they are earned. If there is not a reliable basis for estimating royalties, we will recognize revenue in the following quarter when the shipment report is received. Because we have not previously sold software or had license royalty revenue, this is a different type of revenue and revenue recognition policy than previously used by us. The application of revenue recognition or other accounting methodologies, assumptions, and estimates that are different from those we have historically used in our business could complicate our financial statements, expose us to additional accounting and audit costs, and increase the risk of accounting errors in our estimates and financial statements. In addition, this revenue recognition policy can lead to volatility from quarter to quarter in the amount of revenue recognized from license royalties.\nIf increasing use of our software fails to grow adequately such that we do not see growing license royalty revenues from our customers, our business may suffer. Our future growth and financial performance will depend in part on broad market acceptance and use of our software.\nWe could suffer unrecoverable losses on our customers\u2019 accounts receivable, which would adversely affect our financial results.\nOur operating cash flows are dependent on the continued collection of receivables. Our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2016 increased by $4.7 million or 44% compared to the balance as of December 31, 2015. Historically, we have not had significant uncollectible accounts. However, if a customer is unable or refuses to pay we could suffer additional accounting losses as well as a reduction in liquidity. A significant increase in uncollectible accounts would have an adverse impact on our business, liquidity and financial results.\nIf we fail to develop and introduce new or enhanced products on a timely basis, our ability to attract and retain customers could be impaired and our competitive position could be harmed.\nWe operate in a dynamic environment characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards and technological obsolescence. To compete successfully, we must design, develop, market and sell new or enhanced products that provide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability and meet the cost expectations of our customers. The introduction of new products by our competitors, the market acceptance of products based on new or alternative technologies, or the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing or future products obsolete. Our failure to anticipate or develop in a timely manner new or enhanced products or technologies in response to technological shifts could result in decreased revenue. In particular, we may experience difficulties with product design, manufacturing, marketing or certification that could delay or prevent our development, introduction or marketing of new or enhanced products. If we fail to introduce new or enhanced products that meet the needs of our customers or penetrate new markets in a timely fashion, we will lose market share and our operating results will be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to foreign currency risk.\nSales to customers located outside the United States comprised 54% and 70% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, we have four subsidiaries overseas (Switzerland, Japan, Canada and Korea) that record their operating expenses in a foreign currency. Since sales of our products have been denominated to date primarily in U.S. dollars, increases in the value of the U.S. dollar could increase the price of our products so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country, leading to a reduction in sales. Future international activity may result in increased foreign currency denominated sales. Gains and losses on the conversion to U.S. dollars of accounts receivable, accounts payable and other monetary assets and liabilities arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations. We currently do not have hedging or other programs in place to protect against adverse changes in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to other currencies to minimize potential adverse effects.\nIf our customers do not design our solutions into their product offerings, or if our customers\u2019 product offerings are not commercially successful, our business would suffer.\nWith the acquisition of Magnum, we sell video processing SoC solutions to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, who include our SoCs in their products, and to original design manufacturers, or ODMs, who include our SoCs in the products that they supply to OEMs. We refer to ODMs as our customers and OEMs as our end customers, except as otherwise indicated or as the context otherwise requires. Our video processing SoCs are generally incorporated into our customers\u2019 products at the design stage, which is referred to as a design win. As a result, we rely on OEMs to design our solutions into the products that they design and sell. Without these design wins, our business would be harmed. We often incur significant expenditures developing a new SoC solution without any assurance that an OEM will select our solution for design into its own product. Once an OEM designs a competitor\u2019s device into its product, it becomes significantly more difficult for us to sell our SoC solutions to that OEM because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk for the OEM. Furthermore, even if an OEM designs one of our SoC solutions into its product, we cannot be assured that the OEM\u2019s product will be commercially successful over time or at all or that we will receive or continue to receive any revenue from that OEM. If products or other product categories incorporating our SoC solutions are not commercially successful or experience rapid decline, our revenue and business will suffer.\nWe rely on a limited number of third parties to manufacture, assemble and test our products, and the failure to manage our relationships with our third-party contractors successfully could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products.\nIn addition to our in-house manufacturing facilities, we operate an outsourced manufacturing business model that utilizes third-party foundry, assembly and test capabilities. As a result, we rely on third-party foundry wafer fabrication, assembly and test capacity, including sole sourcing, for many components or products. Currently, our semiconductor devices are manufactured by foundries operated by IBM Corp., WIN Semiconductors Cayman Islands Co., Ltd., Qorvo, UMC Group, Global Communication Semiconductors LLC., Sumitomo Electric Device, Tower Semiconductor Ltd., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Limited and Northrop Grumman Space & Mission Systems. We also use third-party contractors for our assembly and test operations, which include, Bourns, SPEL Semiconductor Limited, ASE Group, and Fabrinet.\nRelying on third party manufacturing, assembly and testing presents significant risks to us, including the following:\n\u00b7\nfailure by us, or our customers or their end customers to qualify a selected supplier;\n\u00b7\ncapacity shortages during periods of high demand;\n\u00b7\nreduced control over delivery schedules and quality;\n\u00b7\nshortages of materials and potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand;\n\u00b7\nmisappropriation of our intellectual property;\n\u00b7\nlimited warranties on wafers or products supplied to us;\n\u00b7\npotential increases in prices;\n\u00b7\ninadequate manufacturing yields and excessive costs;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties selecting and integrating new subcontractors; and\n\u00b7\npolitical instability in countries where third-party manufacturers are located.\nThe ability and willingness of our third-party contractors to perform is largely outside our control. If one or more of our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fails to perform its obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, in the event that manufacturing capacity is reduced or eliminated at one or more facilities, we could have difficulties fulfilling our customer orders and our net revenue could decline. In addition, if these third parties fail to deliver quality products and components on time and at reasonable prices, we could have difficulties fulfilling our customer orders, our net revenue could decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe loss of our relationship with any third-party semiconductor foundry without adequate notice would adversely impact our ability to fill customer orders and could damage our customer relationships.\nThe loss of our relationship with or access to any of the semiconductor foundries we currently use for the fabrication of custom designed components and any resulting delay or reduction in the supply to us of semiconductor devices, would severely impact our ability to fulfill customer orders and could damage our relationships with our customers. For example, we may not be successful in forming alternative supply arrangements that provide us with a sufficient supply of GaAs devices. GaAs devices are used in many of the products we manufacture. Because there are a limited number of semiconductor foundries that use the gallium arsenide process technologies we select for our products and that have sufficient capacity to meet our needs, using alternative or additional semiconductor foundries would require an extensive qualification process that could prevent or delay product shipments and revenues. We estimate that it may take up to nine to twelve months to shift production of a given semiconductor circuit design to a new foundry.\nWe do not have long-term supply contracts with most of our contract manufacturers or suppliers, and any disruption in our supply of products or materials could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue and operating results.\nWe currently do not have long-term supply contracts with most of our third-party vendors. We make substantially all of our purchases on a purchase order basis, and our contract manufacturers are not required to supply us products for any specific period or in any specific quantity. We expect that it would take approximately nine to twelve months to transition performance of our foundry or assembly services to new providers. Such a transition would likely require a qualification process by our customers or their end customers. We generally place orders for products with some of our suppliers approximately four to five months prior to the anticipated delivery date, with order volumes based on our forecasts of demand from our customers. Accordingly, if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products, we may be unable to obtain adequate and cost-effective foundry or assembly capacity from our third-party contractors to meet our customers\u2019 delivery requirements, or we may accumulate excess inventories. Our third-party contractors have not provided any assurance to us that adequate capacity will be available to us within the time required to meet additional demand for our products. In addition, the effects of war, terrorism, natural disaster or other catastrophic events could disrupt our supply of products or materials which could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue and operating results.\nBecause of the shortages of some materials and components and our dependence on single source suppliers and custom components for our products for the optical communications, wireless and ASIC markets, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of materials and components of sufficient quality in a timely fashion, or may be required to pay higher prices or to purchase components of lesser quality.\nMany of our products for the optical communications, wireless and ASIC markets are customized and must be qualified with our customers. This means that we cannot change suppliers, materials and components used in our products easily without the risks and delays associated with requalification. Accordingly, while a number of the components we use in our products are made by multiple suppliers, we may effectively have single source suppliers for many of these materials components. Further, we have recently experienced extended lead times for some components.\nIn addition, we currently purchase a number of materials and components, some from single source suppliers, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nsemiconductor wafers;\n\u00b7\nsemiconductor devices;\n\u00b7\napplication-specific monolithic microwave integrated circuits;\n\u00b7\nvoltage regulators;\n\u00b7\npassive components;\n\u00b7\nunusual or low usage components;\n\u00b7\nsurface mount components compliant with the EU\u2019s Restriction of Hazardous Substances (\u201cRoHS\u201d),Directive;\n\u00b7\npackages, substrates, housings, component and custom metal parts;\n\u00b7\nhigh-frequency circuit boards; and\n\u00b7\ncustom connectors.\nAny delay or interruption in the supply of these or other components could impair our ability to manufacture and deliver these products, harm our reputation and cause a reduction in our revenues. In addition, any increase in the cost of the components that we use in these products could make these products less competitive and lower our margins. Shortages and quality issues could adversely impact our revenues. Our single source suppliers could enter into exclusive agreements with or be acquired by one of our competitors, increase their prices, refuse to sell their products to us, discontinue products or go out of business. Even to the extent alternative suppliers are available to us and their components are qualified with our customers on a timely basis, identifying them and entering into arrangements with them may be difficult and time consuming, and they may not meet our quality standards. We may not be able to obtain sufficient quantities of required components on the same or substantially the same terms.\nOur customers require our products and our third-party contractors to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process which does not assure product sales.\nPrior to purchasing our products, our customers require that both our products and our third-party contractors undergo extensive qualification processes, which involve testing of the products in the customer\u2019s system and rigorous reliability testing. This qualification process may continue for six months or more. However, qualification of a product by a customer does not assure any sales of the product to that customer. Even after successful qualification and sales of a product to a customer, a subsequent revision to the product, changes in our customer\u2019s manufacturing process or our selection of a new supplier may require a new qualification process, which may result in delays and in us holding excess or obsolete inventory. After our products are qualified, it can take an additional six months to a full year or even more before the customer commences volume production of components or devices that incorporate our products. Despite these uncertainties, we devote substantial resources, including design, engineering, sales, marketing and management efforts, to qualifying our products with customers in anticipation of sales. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any of our products with a customer, sales of that product to the customer may be precluded or delayed, which may impede our growth and cause our business to suffer.\nWe are subject to order and shipment uncertainties, as well as unstable and unpredicted delivery schedule commitments, and differences between our estimates of customer demand and product mix and our actual results could negatively affect our inventory levels, sales and operating results.\nOur revenue is generated on the basis of purchase orders with our customers rather than long-term purchase commitments. In addition, our customers can cancel purchase orders or defer the shipments of our products under certain circumstances. Our products are manufactured using semiconductor foundry partners according to our estimates of customer demand, which requires us to make separate demand forecast assumptions for every customer, each of which may introduce significant variability into our aggregate estimate. We have limited visibility into future customer demand and the product mix that our customers will require, which could adversely affect our revenue forecasts and operating margins. Moreover, because our target markets are relatively new, many of our customers have difficulty accurately forecasting their product requirements and estimating the timing of their new product introductions, which ultimately affects their demand for our products. In addition, the rapid pace of innovation in our industry could render significant portions of our inventory obsolete. Excess or obsolete inventory levels could result in unexpected expenses or increases in our reserves that could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Conversely, if we were to underestimate customer demand or if sufficient manufacturing capacity were unavailable, we could forego revenue opportunities, potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships. In addition, any significant future cancellations or deferrals of product orders or the return of previously sold products due to manufacturing defects could materially and adversely impact our profit margins, increase our write-offs due to product obsolescence and restrict our ability to fund our operations.\nWinning business is subject to lengthy competitive selection processes that require us to incur significant expenditures and meaningful resource allocation. Even if we begin a product design, a customer may decide to cancel or change its product plans, which could cause us to generate reduced and/or delayed revenue from a product along with unrecoverable expenses and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe selection process for obtaining new business typically is lengthy and can require us to incur significant design and development expenditures and dedicate scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. We may not win the competitive selection process and may never generate any revenue despite incurring significant design and development expenditures. These risks are exacerbated by the fact that some of our customers\u2019 products likely will have short life cycles. Failure to obtain business in a new product design could prevent us from offering an entire generation of a product, even though this has not occurred to date. This could cause us to lose revenue and require us to write off obsolete inventory, and could weaken our position in future competitive selection processes.\nAfter securing new business, we may experience delays in generating revenue from our products as a result of the lengthy development cycle typically required. Our customers generally take a considerable amount of time to evaluate our products. The typical time from early engagement by our sales force to actual product introduction could run from 12 to 24 months. The delays inherent in these lengthy sales cycles increase the risk that a customer will decide to cancel, curtail, reduce or delay its product plans, causing us to lose anticipated sales. In addition, any delay or cancellation of a customer\u2019s plans could materially and adversely affect our financial results, as we may have incurred significant expense and generated no revenue. Finally, our customers\u2019 failure to successfully market and sell their products could reduce demand for our products and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we were unable to generate revenue after incurring substantial expenses to develop any of our products, our business would suffer.\nMany of our products will have long sales cycles, which may cause us to expend resources without an acceptable financial return and which makes it difficult to plan our expenses and forecast our revenue.\nMany of our products will have long sales cycles that involve numerous steps, including initial customer contacts, specification writing, engineering design, prototype fabrication, pilot testing, regulatory approvals (if needed), sales and marketing and commercial manufacture. During this time, we may expend substantial financial resources and management time and effort without any assurance that product sales will result. The anticipated long sales cycle for some of our products makes it difficult to predict the quarter in which sales may occur.\nDelays in sales may cause us to expend resources without an acceptable financial return and make it difficult to plan expenses and forecast revenues.\nWe are subject to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry.\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. The industry experienced a significant downturn during the recent global recession. These downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, and high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. The recent downturn and any future downturns could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Furthermore, any upturn in the semiconductor industry could result in increased competition for access to third-party foundry and assembly capacity. We are dependent on the availability of this capacity to manufacture and assemble our products, and our third-party manufacturers have not provided assurances that adequate capacity will be available to us in the future. Those delivery cycles can be in some cases longer than 6 months.\nA large proportion of our products are directed at the telecom, datacom, consumer electronics and networking markets, which continue to be subject to overcapacity and seasonality.\nThe technology equipment industry is cyclical and has experienced significant and extended downturns in the past, often in connection with, or in anticipation of, maturing product cycles, and capital spending cycles and declines in general economic conditions. The cyclical nature of these markets has led to significant imbalances in demand, inventory levels and production capacity. It has also accelerated the decrease of average selling prices per unit. We may experience periodic fluctuations in our financial results because of these or other industry-wide conditions. Developments that adversely affect the telecom, datacom, consumer electronics and networking markets, including delays in traffic growth and changes in U.S. government regulation, could halt our efforts to generate revenue or cause revenue growth to be slower than anticipated from sales of electro-optic devices, semiconductors and related products. Reduced spending and technology investment by telecom companies may make it more difficult for our products to gain market acceptance. Our potential customers may be less willing to purchase new technology such as our technology or invest in new technology development when they have reduced capital expenditure budgets.\nWe may require additional capital to continue to fund our operations. If we need but do not obtain additional capital, we may be required to substantially limit operations.\nWe may not generate sufficient cash from our operations to finance our anticipated operations for the foreseeable future from such operations. We could require additional financing sooner than expected if we have poor financial results, including unanticipated expenses, or an unanticipated drop in projected revenues. Such financing may be unavailable when needed or may not be available on acceptable terms. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our current stockholders will be reduced, and these securities may have rights superior to those of its common stock. If adequate funds are not available to satisfy either short-term or long-term capital requirements, or if planned revenues are not generated, we may be required to limit our operations substantially. These limitations of operations may include a possible sale or shutdown of portions of our business, reductions in capital expenditures and reductions in staff and discretionary costs.\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception, attributable to our efforts to design and commercialize our products, and only started to report net income in 2015. We have managed our liquidity during this time through a series of cost reduction initiatives and through increasing our line of credit with our bank. We had $35.8 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016. However, while we have additional cash available, our ability to continue as a going concern may be dependent on many events some of which are outside of our direct control, including, among other things, obtaining additional financing either privately or through public markets, should this be necessary, and customers purchasing our products in substantially higher volumes.\nRestrictive covenants under our credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank may adversely affect our operations.\nIf we utilize our loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, it contains a number of restrictive covenants that will impose significant operating and financial restrictions on our ability to, without prior written approval from Silicon Valley Bank:\n\u00b7\nmerge or consolidate, or permit any of our subsidiaries to merge or consolidate, with or into any other business organization, or acquire, or permit any of our subsidiaries to acquire, all or substantially all of the capital stock or property of another person or company;\n\u00b7\nsell, lease, or otherwise transfer, or permit any of our subsidiaries to sell, lease or otherwise transfer, all or any part of our business or property, except in the ordinary course of business or in connection with certain indebtedness or investments permitted under the loan and security agreement;\n\u00b7\ncreate, incur, or assume any indebtedness, other than certain indebtedness permitted under the loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank;\n\u00b7\npay any dividends (except in the form of our equity securities) or make any distributions or payment on, or redeem, retire or repurchase any capital stock; and\n\u00b7\nmake any investment, other than certain investments permitted under the loan and security agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we did not have an outstanding balance on our line of credit, but we did owe $13.0 million on our term loan. A failure to comply with the covenants contained in our loan and security agreement could result in an event of default under the agreement that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of the indebtedness and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe spending cuts imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (\u201cBCA\u201d) could impact our operating results and profit.\nThe U.S. government continues to focus on developing and implementing spending, tax and other initiatives to stimulate the economy, create jobs, and reduce the deficit. One of these initiatives, the BCA, imposed greater constraints around government spending. In an attempt to balance decisions regarding defense, homeland security, and other federal spending priorities, the BCA immediately imposed spending caps that contain approximately $487 billion in reductions to the Department of Defense base budgets over the next ten years (2013 to 2021). Additionally, the BCA triggered an automatic sequestration process, effective March 1, 2013, that would have reduced planned defense spending by an additional $500 billion over a nine-year period that began in the U.S. government\u2019s 2013 fiscal year.\nOn November 2, 2015, the President signed into law the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (\u201cBBA 2015\u201d). BBA 2015 raises the limit on the government\u2019s debt until March 2017 and raises the sequester caps imposed by the BCA by $80 billion, split equally between defense and non-defense spending over the next two years ($50 billion in the U.S. government\u2019s 2016 fiscal year and $30 billion in the U.S. government\u2019s 2017 fiscal year). On December 18, 2015, the President signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, funding the government through September 30, 2016 and on February 9, 2016, the President submitted a budget proposal for the U.S. government\u2019s 2017 fiscal year, consistent with BBA 2015 funding levels. BBA 2015 includes discretionary funding for Department of Defense of approximately $580 billion in the U.S. government\u2019s 2016 fiscal year and $583 billion in the U.S. government\u2019s 2017 fiscal year. This funding includes a base budget for the Department of Defense of approximately $521 billion in the U.S. government\u2019s 2016 fiscal year and $524 billion in the U.S. government\u2019s 2017 fiscal year. BBA 2015 also provides approximately $59 billion for Department of Defense Overseas Contingency Operations (\u201cOCO\u201d) spending in each of the U.S. government\u2019s 2016 and 2017 fiscal years.\nThe Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (\u201cBBA 2013\u201d) passed by Congress in December 2013 alleviated some budget cuts that would have otherwise been instituted through sequestration in the U.S. government\u2019s 2014 and 2015 fiscal years. Together, BBA 2013 and BBA 2015 (collectively, the \u201cBipartisan Budget Acts\u201d) increased discretionary spending limits through the U.S. government\u2019s 2017 fiscal year. However, the Bipartisan Budget Acts retained sequestration cuts for the U.S. government\u2019s 2018 through 2021 fiscal years, including the across the- board spending reduction methodology provided for in the BCA. As a result, there remains uncertainty regarding how, or if, sequestration cuts will be applied in the U.S. government\u2019s 2018 fiscal year and beyond. Department of Defense and other agencies may have significantly less flexibility in how to apply budget cuts in future years. While the defense budget sustained the largest single reductions under the BCA, other civil agencies and programs have also been impacted by significant spending reductions. In light of the BCA and deficit reduction pressures, it is likely that discretionary spending by the U.S. government will remain constrained for a number of years. Additionally, if an annual appropriations bill is not enacted for the U.S. government\u2019s 2017 fiscal year or beyond, the U.S. government may operate under a continuing resolution, restricting new contract or program starts and government shutdowns could arise. We anticipate there will continue to be significant debate within the U.S. government over defense spending throughout the budget appropriations process for the U.S. government\u2019s 2017 fiscal year and beyond. The outcome of these debates could have long-term consequences for our industry and company.\nAlthough we cannot predict where any cuts that occur will be made or how long they may last, we believe our portfolio of product offerings are well positioned and will not be materially impacted by the Department of Defense budget cuts. However, the possibility remains that any Department of Defense budget cuts could have an impact on sales of our products which can be used downstream in military applications, and thus, the revenues which we derive from such sales.\nOur future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key senior management, design engineering, sales, marketing, and technical personnel and our ability to identify, hire and retain additional, qualified personnel.\nOur future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our senior management personnel, including our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Avi Katz, our Chief Technical Officer, Andrea Betti-Berutto and our Chief Operating Officer, Dr. Raluca Dinu. We do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our executive officers. The loss of key senior executives could have a material adverse effect on our business. There is intense competition for qualified personnel in the semiconductor industries, and we may not be able to continue to attract and retain engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business, or to replace engineers or other qualified personnel who may leave our employment in the future. There may be significant costs associated with recruiting, hiring and retaining personnel. Periods of contraction in our business may inhibit our ability to attract and retain our personnel. Loss of the services of, or failure to recruit, key design engineers or other technical and management personnel could be significantly detrimental to our product development or other aspects of our business.\nOur business, financial condition and operating results would be harmed if we do not achieve anticipated revenues.\nIn response to anticipated long lead times to obtain inventory and materials from outside contract manufacturers, suppliers and foundries, we may need to order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand. This advance ordering may result in excess inventory levels or unanticipated inventory write-downs if expected orders fail to materialize, or other factors render our products less marketable. If we are forced to hold excess inventory or incur unanticipated inventory write-downs, our financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed.\nOur expense levels are relatively fixed and are based on our expectations of future revenue. We have a limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls. Changes to production volumes and impact of overhead absorption may result in a decline in our financial condition or liquidity.\nOur strategy of growth through acquisitions and spin-outs could harm our business.\nIt is our intent to continue to grow through strategic acquisitions. Successful integration of newly acquired target companies may place a significant burden on our management and internal resources. The diversion of management\u2019s attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration processes could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, we may be unable to execute our acquisition strategy, resulting in under-utilized resources and a failure to achieve anticipated growth. Our operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected if we are unable to achieve, or achieve on a timely basis, cost savings or revenue opportunities from any future acquisitions, or incur unforeseen costs and expenses or experience unexpected operating difficulties from the integration of acquired businesses.\nOur strategy of growth through establishing joint ventures with third-parties could harm our business.\nIt is our intent to continue to grow through strategic partnerships and joint ventures. Successful inception and funding of new strategic ventures may place a significant burden on our management and internal resources. The diversion of management\u2019s attention and any difficulties encountered in the establishment of any joint venture could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Furthermore, a joint venture involves certain risks including:\n\u00b7\nIt may not be possible to maintain good relationships with a joint venture partner;\n\u00b7\nOur joint venture partners may in the future have economic or business interests that are inconsistent with our interests;\n\u00b7\nFunding, planned for or otherwise, may not come to fruition or be sufficient for operation of a joint venture;\n\u00b7\nParties to a joint venture may fail to fulfill commitments, including providing accurate and timely accounting and financial information;\n\u00b7\nIt is possible that a joint venture may experience operating difficulties and financial losses, which may lead to asset write-downs or impairment charges that could negatively impact the operating results of the joint venture or us, or impose unforeseen costs and expenses to remedy; and\n\u00b7\nIt is possible that a joint venture could lose key personnel.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing risks or other failure of a joint venture may mean that we are unable to execute our partnership strategy or achieve on a timely basis revenue opportunities from a joint venture or anticipated growth, or may result in under-utilized resources.\nWe have made and continue to make strategic investments and enter into strategic licensing and collaborative partnerships and relationships with third parties. The anticipated benefits of these investments, partnerships and relationships may never materialize and these investments, partnerships and relationships may instead disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.\nWe have made and will continue to make strategic investments (most recently in January 2016 into Anagog Ltd.) in and enter into strategic licensing and collaborative partnerships and relationships with third parties with the goal of acquiring or gaining access to new and innovative semiconductor products and technologies, as well as other technologies which can be used to add to the differentiation of our emerging products, on a timely basis. Negotiating and performing under these arrangements involves significant time and expense, and we cannot assure you that the anticipated benefits of these arrangements will ever materialize or that the products or technologies involved will ever be commercialized or that, as a result, we will not have write down a portion or all of our investment. We may end up with investments in, or owing various obligations and commitments to, third parties related to these arrangements. Such arrangements can magnify several risks for us, including loss of control over the development and development timeline of products being developed with third parties. Accordingly, we face increased risk that development activities may result in products that are not commercially successful or that are not available in a timely fashion. In addition, any third party with whom we enter into a development, product collaboration or technology licensing arrangement may fail to commit sufficient resources to the project, change its policies or priorities and abandon or fail to perform its obligations related to the collaboration. The failure to timely develop commercially successful products through our development projects or strategic investment activities as a result of any of these and other challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Other challenges and risks presented by use of strategic partnerships include:\n\u00b7\nThe acquisition of a partner with which we have an investment or strategic relationship by an unaffiliated\n\u00b7\nthird party that either delays or jeopardizes the original intent of the partnering relationship or investment; and\n\u00b7\nOur inability to liquidate an investment in a privately held company when we believe it is prudent to do so which results in a significant reduction in value or loss of our entire investment.\nWe are subject to the risks frequently experienced by small public companies.\nThe likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the risks frequently encountered by small public companies, especially those formed to develop and market new technologies. These risks include our potential inability to:\n\u00b7\nestablish product sales and marketing capabilities;\n\u00b7\nestablish and maintain markets for our potential products;\n\u00b7\nidentify, attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel;\n\u00b7\ncontinue to develop and upgrade our technologies to keep pace with changes in technology and the growth of markets using semiconductors;\n\u00b7\ndevelop expanded product production facilities and outside contractor relationships;\n\u00b7\nmaintain our reputation and build trust with customers;\n\u00b7\nimprove existing and implement new transaction processing, operational and financial systems;\n\u00b7\nscale up from small pilot or prototype quantities to large quantities of product on a consistent basis;\n\u00b7\ncontract for or develop the internal skills needed to master large volume production of our products; and\n\u00b7\nfund the capital expenditures required to develop volume production due to the limits of available financial resources.\nOur future growth will suffer if we do not achieve sufficient market acceptance of our products.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our ability to maintain and gain market acceptance of our products. To be accepted, these products must meet the quality, technical performance and price requirements of our existing customers and potential new customers. The optical communications industry is currently fragmented with many competitors developing different technologies. Some of these technologies may not gain market acceptance. Our products may not be accepted by OEMs and systems integrators of optical communications networks and consumer electronics. In addition, even if we achieve some degree of market acceptance for our potential products in one industry, we may not achieve market acceptance in other industries for which we are developing products, where market acceptance is critical to meeting our financial targets.\nMany of our current products are either in the final stages of development or are being tested by potential customers. We cannot be assured that our development efforts or customer tests will be successful or that they will result in actual material sales, or that such products will be commercially viable.\nAchieving market acceptance for our products will require marketing efforts and the expenditure of financial and other resources to create product awareness and demand by customers. It will also require the ability to provide excellent customer service. We may be unable to offer products that compete effectively due to our limited resources and operating history. Also, certain large corporations may be predisposed against doing business with a company of our limited size and operating history. Failure to achieve broad acceptance of our products by customers and to compete effectively would harm our operating results.\nSuccessful commercialization of current and future products will require us to maintain a high level of technical expertise.\nTechnology in our target markets is undergoing rapid change. To succeed in these target markets, we will have to establish and maintain a leadership position in the technology supporting those markets. Accordingly, our success will depend on our ability to: accurately predict the needs of target customers and develop, in a timely manner, the technology required to support those needs;\n\u00b7\naccurately predict the needs of target customers and develop, in a timely manner, the technology required to support those needs;\n\u00b7\nprovide products that are not only technologically sophisticated but are also available at a price acceptable to customers and competitive with comparable products;\n\u00b7\nestablish and effectively defend our intellectual property; and\n\u00b7\nenter into relationships with other companies that have developed complementary technology into which our products may be integrated.\nWe cannot be certain that we will be able to achieve any of these objectives.\nThe failure to compete successfully could harm our business.\nWe face competitive pressures from a variety of companies in our target markets. The telecom, datacom, and consumer opto-electronics markets are highly competitive and we expect that domestic and international competition will increase in these markets, due in part to deregulation, rapid technological advances, price erosion, changing customer preferences and evolving industry standards. Increased competition could result in significant price competition, reduced revenues or lower profit margins. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have or may have substantially greater research and product development capabilities, financial, scientific, marketing, and manufacturing and human resources, name recognition and experience than we do. As a result, these competitors may:\n\u00b7\nsucceed in developing products that are equal to or superior to our products or that will achieve greater market acceptance than our products;\n\u00b7\ndevote greater resources to developing, marketing or selling their products;\n\u00b7\nrespond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or scientific advances and changes in customer requirements, which could render our technologies or potential products obsolete;\n\u00b7\nintroduce products that make the continued development of our potential products uneconomical;\n\u00b7\nobtain patents that block or otherwise inhibit our ability to develop and commercialize potential products;\n\u00b7\nwithstand price competition more successfully than us;\n\u00b7\nestablish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that enhance their ability to address the needs of prospective customers better than us; and\n\u00b7\ntake advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities more readily than us.\nCompetitors may offer enhancements to existing products, or offer new products based on new technologies, industry standards or customer requirements that are available to customers on a much timelier basis than comparable products from our company or that have the potential to replace or provide lower cost alternatives to our products. The introduction of enhancements or new products by competitors could render our existing and future products obsolete or unmarketable. Each of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to obtain effective intellectual property protection for our trade secrets, potential products, technology and know-how.\nAny intellectual property that we have or may acquire, license or develop in the future may not provide meaningful competitive advantages. Our patents and patent applications, including those we license, may be challenged by competitors, and the rights granted under such patents or patent applications may not provide meaningful proprietary protection. For example, there are patents held by third parties that relate to electro-optic devices. These patents could be used as a basis to challenge the validity or limit the scope of our patents or patent applications. A successful challenge to the validity or limitation of the scope of our patents or patent applications could limit our ability to commercialize the technology and, consequently, reduce revenues. Moreover, competitors may infringe our patents or those that we license, or successfully avoid these patents through design innovation. To combat infringement or unauthorized use, we may need to resort to litigation, which can be expensive, time-consuming and may not succeed in protecting our proprietary rights. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that our patents or other intellectual property rights are not valid or are unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the intellectual property at issue on the grounds that it is non-infringing. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and expensive, and we may not be able to, or have the resources to, prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect these rights as fully as the laws of the United States.\nWe also rely on the law of trade secrets to protect unpatented technology and know-how. We protect this technology and know-how by limiting access to those employees, contractors and strategic partners with a need to know this information and by entering into confidentiality agreements with these parties. Any of these parties could breach the agreements and disclose our trade secrets or confidential information to competitors, or such competitors might learn of the information in other ways. Disclosure of any trade secret not protected by a patent could materially harm our business.\nWe may be subject to patent infringement claims, or we may be required to defend or indemnify claims of patent infringements by others, which could result in substantial costs and liability and prevent us from commercializing potential products.\nThird parties may claim that our potential products or related technologies infringe their patents. Any patent infringement claims brought against us may cause us to incur significant expenses, divert the attention of management and key personnel from other business concerns and, if successfully asserted, require us to pay substantial damages. In addition, as a result of a patent infringement suit, we may be forced to stop or delay developing, manufacturing or selling potential products that are claimed to infringe a patent covering a third party\u2019s intellectual property unless that party grants us rights to use its intellectual property. We may be unable to obtain these rights on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if we are able to obtain rights to a third party\u2019s patented intellectual property, these rights may be non-exclusive, and therefore competitors may obtain access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we may be unable to commercialize our potential products or may have to cease some business operations as a result of patent infringement claims, which could severely harm our business.\nIf our potential products infringe the intellectual property rights of others, we may be required to indemnify customers for any damages they suffer. Third parties may assert infringement claims against our current or potential customers. These claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of customers, regardless of the merits of these claims. If any of these claims succeed, we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of these customers or may be required to obtain licenses for the products they use. If we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, we may be unable to continue selling such products.\nThe technology that we license from various third parties may be subject to government rights and retained rights of the originating research institution.\nWe license technology from various companies and entities. Many of these partners and licensors have obligations to government agencies or universities. Under their agreements, a government agency or university may obtain certain rights over the technology that we have developed and licensed, including the right to require that a compulsory license be granted to one or more third parties selected by the government agency.\nIn addition, our partners often retain certain rights under their licensing agreements, including the right to use the technology for noncommercial academic and research use, to publish general scientific findings from research related to the technology, and to make customary scientific and scholarly disclosures of information relating to the technology. It is difficult to monitor whether such partners limit their use of the technology to these uses, and we could incur substantial expenses to enforce our rights to this licensed technology in the event of misuse.\nIf we fail to develop and maintain the quality of our manufacturing processes, our operating results would be harmed.\nThe manufacture of our products is a multi-stage process that requires the use of high-quality materials and advanced manufacturing technologies. Manufacturing must occur in a highly controlled, clean room environment to minimize particles and other yield- and quality-limiting contaminants. In spite of stringent quality controls, weaknesses in process control or minute impurities in materials may cause a substantial percentage of the product in a lot to be defective. If we are unable to develop and continue to improve on our manufacturing processes or to maintain stringent quality controls, or if contamination problems arise, our operating results would be harmed.\nThe complexity of our products may lead to errors, defects and bugs, which could result in the necessity to redesign products or even recall them after shipment and could negatively impact our reputation with customers and our financial performance.\nProducts as complex as ours may contain errors, defects and bugs when first introduced or as new versions are released. Delivery of products with production defects, reliability, quality, or compatibility problems could significantly delay or hinder market acceptance of our products or result in a costly recall and could damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and to attract new customers, as well as create a material financial harm. In particular, certain products are customized or designed for integration into specific network systems. If our products experience defects, we may need to undertake a redesign of the product, a process that may result in significant additional expenses.\nWe may also be required to make significant expenditures of capital and resources to resolve such problems. There is no assurance that problems will not be found in new products after commencement of commercial production, despite testing by us, our suppliers and our customers.\nOur products may contain component, manufacturing or design defects or may not meet our customers\u2019 performance criteria, which could cause us to incur significant expenses to repair, harm our customer relationships and industry reputation, and reduce our revenues and profitability.\nOur product warranties typically last twelve months. As a result of component, manufacturing or design defects, we may be required to repair or replace a substantial number of products under our product warranties, incurring significant expenses as a result. Further, our customers may discover latent defects in our products that were not apparent when the warranty period expired. These latent defects may cause us to incur significant repair or replacement expenses beyond the normal warranty period. In addition, any component, manufacturing or design defect could cause us to lose customers or revenues or damage our customer relationships and industry reputation.\nWe could be exposed to significant product liability claims that could be time-consuming and costly and impair our ability to obtain and maintain insurance coverage.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims if any of our products are alleged to be defective or harmful. Product liability claims or other claims related to our potential products, regardless of their outcome, could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation, divert management\u2019s time and attention from other business concerns, require us to pay significant damages, harm our reputation or hinder acceptance of our products. Any successful product liability claim may prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability insurance in the future on commercially reasonable terms. Any inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could impair our ability to commercialize our products. In addition, certain of our products are sold under warranties. The failure of our products to meet the standards set forth in such warranties could result in significant expenses to us.\nOur data and information systems and network infrastructure may be subject to hacking or other cyber security threats. If our security measures are breached and an unauthorized party obtains access to our customer data or our proprietary business information, our information systems may be perceived as being unsecure, which could harm our business and reputation, and our proprietary business information could be misappropriated which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn our operations, we store and transmit our proprietary information and that of our customers. We have offices, research and development, and production facilities throughout the world, including key research and development facilities outside of the United States. Our operations are dependent upon the connectivity and continuity of our facilities and operations throughout the world. Despite our security measures, our information systems and network infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks or could be breached due to an employee error or other disruption that could result in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information which has the potential to significantly interfere with our business operations. Breaches of our security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation and potential liability. Since techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures in advance of such an attack on our systems. In addition, we use a vendor that uses cyber or \u201cCloud\u201d storage of information as part of their service or product offerings, and despite our attempts to validate the security of such services, our proprietary information may be misappropriated by third parties. In the event of an actual or perceived breach of our security, or the security of one of our vendors, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could suffer damage to our reputation or our business, or lose existing customers and lose our ability to obtain new customers. Additionally, misappropriation of our proprietary business information could prove competitively harmful to our business.\nOur video processing SoC product strategy, which is targeted at markets demanding superior video quality, may not address the demands of our target customers and may not lead to increased revenue in a timely manner or at all, or even may deteriorate significantly, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and limit our ability to grow.\nWe have adopted a product strategy for our video processing SoCs that focuses on our core competencies in video processing and delivering high levels of video quality. With this strategy, we continue to make further investments in the development of our video processor architecture. This strategy is designed to address the needs of customers in the market for video processing SoCs. Such markets may not develop, may take longer to develop than we expect, or may change direction altogether. We cannot assure you that the products we are currently selling and developing will adequately address the demands of our target customers, or that we will be able to produce our new products at costs that enable us to price these products competitively.\nRapidly changing industry standards could make our video processing solutions obsolete, which would cause our operating results to suffer.\nWe design our video processing solutions to conform to video compression standards, including MPEG-2, H.264 and H.265, set by industry standards setting bodies such as ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group and the ISO/IEC Moving Picture Experts Group. Generally, our solutions comprise only a part of a camera or broadcast infrastructure equipment device. All components of these devices must uniformly comply with industry standards in order to operate efficiently together. We depend on companies that provide other components of the devices to support prevailing industry standards. Many of these companies are significantly larger and more influential in driving industry standards than we are. Some industry standards may not be widely adopted or implemented uniformly, and competing standards may emerge that may be preferred by our customers or by consumers. If our customers or the suppliers that provide other device components adopt new or competing industry standards with which our solutions are not compatible, or if the industry groups fail to adopt standards with which our solutions are compatible, or adopt free open source codecs, our existing solutions would become less desirable to our customers. As a result, our sales would suffer or even completely vanish, and not only would we lose a major source of revenue, but we could be required to make significant expenditures to develop new SoC solutions. For example, if the new H.265 video compression standard is not broadly adopted by our customers or potential customers, sales of our H.265 compliant solutions would suffer and we may be required to expend substantial resources to comply with an alternative video compression standard. In addition, existing standards may be challenged as infringing upon the intellectual property rights of other companies or may be superseded by new innovations or standards.\nProducts for communications applications are based on industry standards that are continually evolving. Our ability to compete in the future will depend on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with these evolving industry standards, including any new video compression standards, and our ability to deliver superior products against potential open source free products that will be made available in the market. The emergence of new industry standards could render our solutions incompatible with products developed by other suppliers. As a result, we could be required to invest significant time and effort and to incur significant expense to redesign our solutions to ensure compliance with relevant standards. If our solutions are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards for a significant period of time, we could miss opportunities to achieve crucial design wins, which could harm our business.\nThe complexity of our video processing SoC solutions could result in unforeseen delays or expenses from undetected defects, errors or bugs in hardware or software which could reduce the market adoption of our new solutions, damage our reputation with current or prospective customers and adversely affect our operating costs.\nHighly complex video processing SoC solutions such as ours frequently contain defects, errors and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions are released. We have in the past and may in the future experience these defects, errors and bugs. If any of our solutions have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, we may not be able to successfully correct these problems in a timely manner or at all. In addition, if any of our proprietary features contain defects, errors or bugs when first introduced or as new versions of our solutions are released, we may be unable to timely correct these problems. Consequently, our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our solutions, which could harm our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers, and could adversely affect our financial results. In addition, these defects, errors or bugs could interrupt or delay sales to our customers. If any of these problems are not found until after we have commenced commercial production of a new product, we may incur significant additional development costs and product recall, repair or replacement costs. These problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others.\nUnknowing use of open source software in our products, processes and technology may expose us to additional risks and compromise our proprietary intellectual property.\nWe may unknowingly utilize and incorporate software that is subject to an open source license in our products, processes and technology in a manner that could create unintended risks. Open source software is typically freely accessible, usable and modifiable. Certain open source software licenses, such as the GNU General Public License, require a user who distributes the open source software as a component of the user\u2019s software to disclose publicly part or all of the source code to the user\u2019s software. In addition, certain open source software licenses require the user of such software to make any derivative works of the open source code available to others on terms unfavorable to us or at no cost. This can subject previously proprietary software to open source license terms.\nWhile we monitor the use of open source software in our products, processes and technology and try to ensure that no open source software is used in such a way as to require us to disclose the source code to the related product, processes or technology when we do not wish to do so, such use could inadvertently occur. Additionally, if a third-party software provider has incorporated certain types of open source software into software we license from such third-party for our products, processes or technology, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to disclose the source code to our products, processes or technology. This could harm our intellectual property position and our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our growth, and effectively transition from our focus on research and development activities to commercially successful products, our business could suffer.\nFailure to manage growth of operations could harm our business. To date, a large number of our activities and resources have been directed at the research and development of our technologies and development of potential related products. The transition from a focus on research and development to being a vendor of products requires effective planning and management. Additionally, growth arising from the expected synergies from future acquisitions will require effective planning and management. Future expansion will be expensive and will likely strain management and other resources.\nIn order to effectively manage growth, we must:\n\u00b7\ncontinue to develop an effective planning and management process to implement our business strategy;\n\u00b7\nhire, train and integrate new personnel in all areas of our business; and\n\u00b7\nexpand our facilities and increase capital investments.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to accomplish these tasks effectively or otherwise effectively manage our growth.\nThe industry and markets in which we compete are subject to constant consolidation, which may result in stronger competitors, fewer customers and reduced demand.\nThere has been continuous industry consolidation during the last few years among communications IC companies, network equipment companies and telecom companies. This consolidation is expected to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their positions in evolving markets. Consolidation may result in stronger competitors, fewer customers and reduced demand, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur operating results are subject to volume and price fluctuations because we have international sales.\nInternational sales account for a large portion of our revenue and may account for an increasing portion of future revenue. The revenue derived from international sales may be subject to certain risks, including:\n\u00b7\nforeign currency exchange fluctuations;\n\u00b7\nchanges in regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\ntariffs and other barriers;\n\u00b7\ntiming and availability of export licenses;\n\u00b7\npolitical and economic instability;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in accounts receivable collections;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in managing distributors;\n\u00b7\ndifferent and flexible holiday and vacation periods;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in obtaining governmental approvals for communications and other products;\n\u00b7\nreduced or uncertain protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u00b7\nlonger payment cycles to collect accounts receivable in some countries;\n\u00b7\nthe burden of complying with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties; and\n\u00b7\npotentially adverse tax consequences.\nWe are subject to regulatory compliance related to our operations.\nWe are subject to various U.S. governmental regulations related to occupational safety and health, labor and business practices. Failure to comply with current or future regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alterations of our production processes, cessation of operations, or other actions, which could harm our business.\nRegulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may force us to incur additional expenses, may result in damage to our business reputation and may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.\nIn August 2012, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC adopted new requirements for companies that use certain minerals and derivative metals (referred to as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d regardless of their actual country of origin) in their products. Some of these metals are commonly used in electronic equipment and devices, including our products. These new requirements will require companies to investigate, disclose and report whether or not such metals originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. We have a complex supply chain for the components and parts used in each of our products. We have numerous foreign suppliers, many of whom are not obligated by the new law to investigate their own supply chains. As a result, we may incur significant costs to comply with the diligence and disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant metals used in our products. In addition, because our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origin of all the relevant metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures we implement, which may harm our business reputation. We may have customers who will need to know our conflict mineral status to satisfy their own SEC reporting obligations (if any), and as a result we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers if they require that we prove or certify that our products are \u201cconflict free.\u201d Key components and parts that can be shown to be \u201cconflict free\u201d may not be available to us in sufficient quantity, or at all, or may only be available at significantly higher cost to us. If we are not able to meet customer requirements, customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier. Any of these outcomes could adversely impact our business, financial condition or operating results.\nAlthough the SEC has provided temporary relief for products deemed to be \u201cDRC Conflict Undeterminable\u201d if we are unable to determine whether the minerals in our products originated from a covered country or were used to finance or benefit armed groups in the covered countries for a temporary two year period, or in the case of smaller reporting companies such as GigPeak for a period of four years, we will still be required to file a Conflict Minerals Report and include certain disclosures similar to those required for \u201cNot DRC Conflict Free\u201d products, but we will not be required to obtain an audit of that report. We will nonetheless be required to disclose the steps we have taken or intend to take to mitigate the risk that the conflict minerals in our products are benefitting armed groups in the covered countries. This additional reporting and compliance burden may increase our expenses and costs related to our supply chain and disclosure requirements.\nWe may incur a liability arising from our use of hazardous materials.\nOur business and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation, handling, treatment, storage and disposal of certain toxic or hazardous materials and waste products that are used or generated in our operations. Many of these environmental laws and regulations subject current or previous owners or occupiers of land to liability for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous materials. In addition, these laws and regulations typically impose liability regardless of whether the owner or occupier knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of any hazardous materials and regardless of whether the actions that led to their presence were taken in compliance with the law. Our domestic facilities use various chemicals in manufacturing processes that may be toxic and covered by various environmental controls. These hazardous materials may be stored on site. The waste created by use of these materials is transported off- site by an unaffiliated waste hauler. Many environmental laws and regulations require generators of waste to take remedial actions at an off-site disposal location even if the disposal was conducted lawfully. The requirements of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future. Failure to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of production processes, cessation of operations or other actions, which could severely harm our business.\nGovernment regulation of the communications industry could limit the growth of the markets that we serve or could require costly alterations of our current or future products.\nThe markets that we serve are highly regulated. Communications service providers must obtain regulatory approvals to operate broadband wireless access networks within specified licensed bands of the frequency spectrum. Further, the Federal Communications Commission and foreign regulatory agencies have adopted regulations that impose stringent RF emissions standards on the communications industry that could limit the growth of the markets that we serve or could require costly alterations of our current or future products.\nWe may be unable to export some of our potential products or technology to other countries, convey information about our technology to citizens of other countries or sell certain products commercially, if the products or technology are subject to U.S. export or other regulations.\nWe are developing certain products that we believe the U.S. government and other governments may be interested in using for military, information gathering or antiterrorism activities. U.S. government export regulations may restrict us from selling or exporting these potential products into other countries, exporting our technology to those countries, conveying information about our technology to citizens of other countries or selling these potential products to commercial customers. We may be unable to obtain export licenses for products or technology if necessary. We currently cannot assess whether national security concerns would affect our potential products and, if so, what procedures and policies we would have to adopt to comply with applicable existing or future regulations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the imposition of legislation and regulations relating to the import or export of high technology products. We cannot predict whether quotas, duties, taxes or other charges or restrictions upon the importation or exportation of our products will be implemented by the United States or other countries.\nVarious laws and regulations potentially affect the import and export of our products, including export control, tax and customs laws. We are also at risk of being out of compliance with certain of these regulations. For example, we recently self-reported certain voluntary disclosures to the Office of Defense Trade Compliance relating to certain ITAR controlled ASICs. Furthermore, some customer purchase orders and agreements are governed by foreign laws, which may differ significantly from laws in the United States. As a result, our ability to enforce our rights under such agreements may be limited compared with our ability to enforce our rights under agreements governed by laws in the United States.\nOur worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe maintain operations around the world, including in North America, Europe and Asia. We rely on third party wafer foundries in the United States and Asia. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products that we do not perform is performed at third-party facilities in Asia. We also have international sales operations and expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. The political, legal and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include, without limitation:\n\u00b7\nexpropriation;\n\u00b7\nchanges in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions;\n\u00b7\ngeopolitical and security issues, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, crime, political instability, and terrorist activity;\n\u00b7\nchanges in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in protecting our intellectual property;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws;\n\u00b7\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions;\n\u00b7\nchanges in freight and interest rates;\n\u00b7\ndisruption in air transportation between the United States and our overseas facilities;\n\u00b7\nloss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and\n\u00b7\ncompliance with U.S. laws and regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nIn addition, our worldwide operations (or those of our business partners) could be subject to natural disasters, public health issues and other catastrophic events, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, typhoons and volcanic eruptions that disrupt manufacturing or other operations. For example, our San Jose operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. Any conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate, including public health issues (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as Avian Influenza, measles or Ebola), safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components, production delays, general business interruptions, delays from difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, tariffs and other barriers and restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWorldwide political conditions may create uncertainties that could adversely affect our business. The United States has been and may continue to be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales and our supply chain. The consequences of armed conflict, political instability or civil or military unrest are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. Terrorist attacks or other hostile acts may negatively affect our operations, or adversely affect demand for our products, and such attacks or related armed conflicts may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Furthermore, these attacks or hostile acts may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive, which could materially adversely affect us. Any of these events could cause consumer spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States economy and worldwide financial markets.\nWe face substantial political risk associated with doing business in South Korea because of tensions in the political relationship between South Korea and North Korea.\nAs we have a South Korean subsidiary, GigOptix-Terasquare-Korea (\u201cGTK\u201d) Co., Ltd., as a result of our acquisition of Terasquare in September of 2015, we face substantial political risk associated from tensions in political relationship between South Korea and North Korea. Relations between South Korea and North Korea have been tense throughout Korea\u2019s modern history. The level of tension between the two Koreas has fluctuated and may increase abruptly as a result of current and future events. In particular, since the death of Kim Jong-il, the former North Korean ruler, in mid-December 2011, there has been increased uncertainty with respect to the future of North Korea\u2019s political leadership and concern regarding its implications for political and economic stability in the region. Although Kim Jong-il\u2019s third son, Kim Jong-eun, has assumed power as his father\u2019s designated successor, the long-term outcome of such leadership transition remains uncertain. In addition, in recent years, there have been heightened security concerns stemming from North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapon and long-range missile programs and increased uncertainty regarding North Korea\u2019s actions and possible responses from the international community. Some of the significant incidents in recent years include the following:\n\u00b7\nIn August 2015, two Korean soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion near the Korean demilitarized zone. Claiming the landmines were set by North Koreans, the Korean army re-initiated its propaganda program toward North Korea utilizing loudspeakers near the demilitarized zone.\n\u00b7\nIn January 2016, North Korea claimed that it had successfully conducted a nuclear bomb test. In February 2016, North Korea launched what it claimed was a satellite rocket, but what is viewed by others as a front for a ballistic missile test that could ultimately be used to carry a nuclear bomb. In response to the launch, it has been reported that Korea and the United States are discussing the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (\u201cTHAAD\u201d) missile defense system to United States forces stationed in Korea. It has been reported that the United Nations Security Council adopted a unanimous resolution condemning the missile launch.\n\u00b7\nFollowing North Korea\u2019s nuclear bomb test and rocket launch, in February 2016, the Korean government announced that it will shut down Kaesong Industrial Complex, a joint venture area with North Korea where over 100 South Korean companies run manufacturing facilities. North Korea responded by declaring Kaesong Industrial Complex a military control zone, ordering South Koreans to leave the complex, and forbidding them to take assets other than personal belongings. The shutdown is the second one since operations commenced at Kaesong Industrial Complex in 2005; the complex had been shut down once before, for five months in 2013. In addition, North Korea cut off all 48 telephone lines between North Korean and South Korean agencies.\n\u00b7\nIn March 2016, South Korea announced unilateral sanctions against North Korea for North Korea\u2019s missile and nuclear programs, and North Korean cyberattacks against South Korean officials and agencies. The sanctions were issued after North Korea threatened pre-emptive nuclear strikes against both the United States and South Korea.\n\u00b7\nIn February 2017, Kim Jong-nam, the estranged older brother of Kim Jong-eun, was assassinated with VX nerve agent at an airport in Malaysia. Since taking power in 2011, Kim Jong-eun has executed at least 140 senior officials, often through the use of anti-aircraft artillery, most recently with the execution of five senior officials on February 27, 2017.\n\u00b7\nIn March 2017, North Korea for the first time simultaneously launched four missiles into the Sea of Japan successfully in what may have been an attempt at simulating a \u201csaturation attack\u201d to overwhelm existing or planned missile defense capabilities in the region.\nNorth Korea\u2019s economy also faces severe challenges, and any adverse economic developments may further aggravate social and political tensions within North Korea. North Korea has also historically sought to test new presidential administrations in the United States. Although we do not derive any revenue from, nor sell any products in, North Korea, any future increase in tensions between South Korea and North Korea that may occur, for example, if North Korea experiences a leadership crisis, high-level contacts between South Korea and North Korea break down further, or if military hostilities occur between North Korea, South Korea, Japan and/or the United States, these could have a material adverse effect on the South Korean economy and on our business, financial condition, results of operations and the market value of our common stock.\nThere may be a limited public market for our common shares, and the ability of our stockholders to dispose of their common shares may be limited.\nOur common shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. We cannot foresee the degree of liquidity that will be associated with our common shares. A holder of our common shares may not be able to liquidate his, her or its investment in a short time period or at the market prices that currently exist at the time the holder decides to sell. The market price for our common stock may fluctuate in the future, and such volatility may bear no relation to our performance.\nSubstantial future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nThe sale of our outstanding common stock or shares issuable upon exercise of options or warrants, or the perception that such sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. As of March 1, 2017, we had approximately 67,641,585 shares of common stock outstanding, 1,781,142 treasury shares, options to purchase 6,894,399 shares of our common stock, restricted stock units to issue 5,470,038 shares of our common stock outstanding, 3,770,516 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans an warrants to purchase 161,554 shares of our common stock outstanding. These shares of common stock, including shares of common stock issued upon exercise of options and warrants, have either been registered under the Securities Act, and as such are freely tradable without further restriction, or are otherwise freely tradable without restriction (subject to the requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act), unless the shares are purchased by \u201caffiliates\u201d as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Any shares purchased by an affiliate may not be resold except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from registration, including an exemption under Rule 144 of the Securities Act. We may issue additional shares of our common stock in the future in private placements, public offerings or to finance mergers or acquisitions.\nThe exercise of options and warrants and other issuances of shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock would dilute the interest of our stockholders.\nAs of March 1, 2017, there were outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 6,894,399 shares of our common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $2.26. As of March 1, 2017, there were outstanding restricted stock units to issue an aggregate of 5,470,038 shares of our common stock. As of March 1, 2017, there were warrants outstanding to purchase 161,554 shares of our common stock, at a weighted-average exercise price of $3.57 per share. The exercise of options and warrants at prices below the market price of our common stock could adversely affect the price of shares of our common stock. Additional dilution may result from the issuance of shares of our capital stock in connection with vesting of restricted stock units, acquisitions or in connection with other financing efforts.\nAny issuance of our common stock that is not made solely to then-existing stockholders proportionate to their interests, such as in the case of a stock dividend or stock split, will result in dilution to each stockholder by reducing his, her or its percentage ownership of the total outstanding shares. Moreover, if we issue options or warrants to purchase our common stock in the future and those options or warrants are exercised, or if we issue restricted stock, stockholders may experience further dilution.\nOur stockholder rights agreement may deter or adversely affect an attempt to acquire us or otherwise prevent a change in control.\nOn December 16, 2014, we entered into an Amended and Restated Rights Agreement (the \u201cAmended Rights Agreement\u201d) to extend the expiration date of our initial stockholder rights plan that was put in place on December 16, 2011. The Amended and Restated Rights Agreement amends the Rights Agreement previously adopted by us by (i) extending the expiration date by three years to December 16, 2017, (ii) decreasing the exercise price per right issued to stockholders pursuant to the stockholder rights plan from $8.50 to $5.25, and (iii) making certain other technical and conforming changes. Under the Rights Agreement, we issued a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each share of our common stock held by stockholders of record as of January 6, 2012, and we will issue one preferred stock purchase right to each share of common stock issued by us between January 6, 2012 and the earlier of either the rights\u2019 exercisability or the expiration of the Rights Agreement, as amended by the Amended Rights Agreement. Each right entitles stockholders to purchase one one-thousandth of our Series A Junior Preferred Stock. In addition, in connection with the Amended Rights Agreement, on December 15, 2014, we adopted an Amended and Restated Certificate of Designation of Series A Junior Preferred Stock, which increased the number of authorized shares of Series A Junior Preferred Stock from 300,000 shares to 750,000 shares, and sets forth the rights, preferences and privileges of the Series A Junior Preferred Stock. Each share of Series A Junior Preferred Stock retains the rights, preferences and privileges set forth above from the Original Certificate of Designation regarding redemption, dividends, voting rights, and liquidation preference.\nIn general, the exercisability of the rights to purchase preferred stock will be triggered if any person or group, including persons knowingly acting in concert to affect our control, is or becomes a beneficial owner of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock after the adoption date of the rights plan. Stockholders or beneficial ownership groups who owned 10% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock on or before the adoption date will not trigger the preferred share purchase rights unless they acquire an additional 1% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Each right entitles a holder with the right upon exercise to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of preferred stock at an exercise price that is currently set at $5.25 per right, subject to purchase price adjustments as set forth in the Amended Rights Agreement. Each share of preferred stock has voting rights equal to one thousand shares of common stock. In the event that exercisability of the rights is triggered, each right held by an acquiring person or group would become void. As a result, upon triggering of exercisability of the rights, there would be significant dilution in the ownership interest of the acquiring person or group, making it difficult or unattractive for the acquiring person or group to pursue an acquisition of us. These rights expire in December of 2017, unless earlier redeemed or exchanged by us.\nIn connection with our entry into the Merger Agreement, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Rights Agreement, dated February 10, 2017 (the \u201cRights Amendment\u201d), amending the Amended Rights Agreement. The effect of the Rights Amendment is to permit the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The Rights Amendment provides that: (i) neither IDT nor the Purchaser nor any of their respective affiliates shall be deemed to be an Acquiring Person (as such term is defined in the Amended Rights Agreement), (ii) neither a Distribution Date nor a Stock Acquisition Date (as each such term is defined in the Amended Rights Agreement) shall be deemed to have occurred, and the Rights (as such term is defined in the Amended Rights Agreement) will not detach from the shares of common stock or become non-redeemable, as a result of the execution, delivery or performance of the Merger Agreement, the Offer and/or the Merger, including the acquisition of shares of common stock pursuant thereto, the Tender and Support Agreements entered into in conjunction with the Merger Agreement or any other transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (iii) the Rights (as such term is defined in the Amended Rights Agreement) and the Amended Rights Agreement shall expire and terminate immediately prior to the acceptance time for the Offer.\nOur quarter-to-quarter performance may vary substantially, and this variance, as well as general market conditions, may cause our stock price to fluctuate greatly and potentially expose us to litigation.\nThe revenues for our product lines and our quarterly operating results may vary significantly based on many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nadditions of new customers or loss of existing customers;\n\u00b7\nfluctuating demand for our products and technologies;\n\u00b7\nannouncements or implementation by competitors of technological innovations or new products;\n\u00b7\nthe status of particular development programs and the timing of performance under specific development agreements;\n\u00b7\ntiming and amounts relating to the expansion of operations;\n\u00b7\ncosts related to possible future acquisitions of technologies or businesses;\n\u00b7\ncommunications, information technology and semiconductor industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in the timing and amount of customer requests for product shipments;\n\u00b7\nthe reduction, rescheduling or cancellation of orders by customers, including as a result of slowing demand for our products or our customers\u2019 products;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the mix of products that our customers buy;\n\u00b7\ncompetitive pressures on selling prices;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our customers to obtain components from their other suppliers;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in manufacturing output, yields or other problems or delays in the fabrication, assembly, testing or delivery of our products or our customers\u2019 products;\n\u00b7\nincreases in the costs of products or discontinuance of products by suppliers; and\n\u00b7\nchange in product and technology trends and demands by the market.\nWe base our current and future expense estimates, in large part, on estimates of future revenue, which is difficult to predict. We expect to continue to make significant operating and capital expenditures in the area of research and development and to invest in and expand production, sales, marketing and administrative systems and processes. We may be unable to, or may elect not to, adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall. If our increased expenses are not accompanied by increased revenue in the same quarter, our quarterly operating results would be harmed.\nIn future quarters, our results of operations may fall below the expectations of investors and the trading price of our common stock may decline as a consequence. We believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results will not be a good indication of future performance and should not be relied upon to predict the future performance of our stock price. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have often been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may prevent takeover attempts that could be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage a takeover of our company even if a change of control would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders. These charter provisions include the following:\n\u00b7\na requirement that our Board of Directors (our \u201cBoard\u201d of our \u201cBoard of Directors\u201d) be divided into three classes, with approximately one-third of the directors to be elected each year; and\n\u00b7\nsupermajority voting requirements (two-thirds of outstanding shares) applicable to the approval of any merger or other change of control transaction that is not approved by our continuing directors. The continuing directors are all of the directors as of the effective time of a merger or who are elected to the board upon the recommendation of a majority of the continuing directors.\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all available funds and future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be our stockholders\u2019 sole source of potential gain for the foreseeable future.\nAlthough we expect to realize certain benefits as a result of the acquisition of Magnum, there is the possibility that we may be unable to successfully integrate the business of our historical acquisitions and in particular that of last year\u2019s Magnum acquisition, realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of Magnum or do so within the intended timeframe.\nWe devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of all of our acquired entities with ours. We are still determining the exact nature of how the business and operations of in particular Magnum will be run. Potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include the following:\n\u00b7\nthe costs of integration and compliance and the possibility that the full benefits anticipated to result from the acquisition of Magnum will not be realized;\n\u00b7\nlack of going forward commitment of Magnum customers, based on fatigue, loss of trust, or disapproval of the directions of Magnum pre-acquisition, or GigPeak post-acquisition;\n\u00b7\nloss of customers that will consider GigPeak to be a competitor post-acquisition, or due to the acquisition of a customer by a competitor to GigPeak;\n\u00b7\ndifferences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies that may delay successful integration;\n\u00b7\ndifferences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies that may delay successful integration;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to create and enforce uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems\u037e and\n\u00b7\nthe disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, our ongoing businesses.\nAny of these factors could adversely affect the ability of GigPeak following the acquisition of Magnum to benefit financially from the acquisition, maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition or could reduce or even completely diminish the earnings or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of GigPeak after the acquisition.\nWe may not have discovered undisclosed liabilities and product deficiencies of Magnum.\nOur due diligence review of Magnum may not have discovered undisclosed liabilities and product deficiencies of Magnum. If Magnum has undisclosed liabilities or product deficiencies, we as a successor owner may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities. we have tried to control its exposure to undisclosed liabilities by obtaining certain protections under the merger agreement for the acquisition of Magnum, including representations and warranties from Magnum regarding undisclosed liabilities, however, such representations and warranties expired by their terms on the completion of the Merger. There can be no assurance that such provisions in the merger agreement for the acquisition of Magnum will protect us against any undisclosed liabilities or product deficiencies being discovered or provide an adequate remedy for any undisclosed liabilities that are discovered. Such undisclosed liabilities could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and may adversely affect the value of our common stock after the consummation of the acquisition.\nThe conditions under the Merger Agreement to IDT\u2019s consummation of the Offer and the subsequent Merger may not be satisfied at all or in the anticipated timeframe.\nOn February 13, 2017, we entered into the Merger Agreement with IDT and the Purchaser pursuant to which, the Purchaser commenced an offer to purchase all the outstanding Shares, for $3.08 per Share and an overall transaction value of approximately $250,000,000 (the \u201cMerger Consideration\u201d). The obligation of Purchaser to purchase the Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer and not validly withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including (i) that there will have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn a number of Shares that, when added to the Shares then owned by IDT and its wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiaries, represents at least a majority of the Shares then outstanding (on a fully-diluted basis) and no less than a majority of the voting power of the shares of capital stock of GigPeak then outstanding (on a fully-diluted basis) and entitled to vote upon the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger, excluding from the number of tendered Shares, but not from the number of outstanding Shares, Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures, to the extent such procedures are permitted by Purchaser, that have not yet been delivered in settlement of such guarantee, (ii) the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) and the receipt of any approval or clearance applicable to the Offer or consummation of the Merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (iii) the accuracy of the representations and warranties and compliance with covenants contained in the Merger Agreement, subject to certain materiality standards, (iv) the absence of any law, order, injunction or decree by any government, court or other governmental entity that would make illegal or otherwise prohibit the Offer or the Merger, (v) there not having been a material adverse effect with respect to GigPeak, and (vi) other customary conditions. These conditions are described in more detail in the Merger Agreement, which we filed as Exhibit 2.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC on February 13, 2017 and which is incorporated herein by reference as Exhibit 2.4.\nWe intend to pursue all required approvals in accordance with the Merger Agreement. However, no assurance can be given that the required approvals will be obtained and, even if all such approvals are obtained, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of the approvals or that they will satisfy the terms of the Merger Agreement. In addition, there can be no assurances that our stockholders will tender their shares, or that any or all of the other conditions will be satisfied. If the Offer and Merger are not completed, or are not completed in a timely manner, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, we, and certain of our directors are named as defendants in litigation brought by purported holders of our common stock challenging our board of directors\u2019 actions in connection with the proposed Merger and seeking, among other things, injunctive relief to enjoin the defendants from completing the Merger on the agreed-upon terms. See Part I, Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for more information regarding such litigation. If a settlement or other resolution is not reached in this litigation and the plaintiffs secure injunctive or other relief prohibiting, delaying or otherwise adversely affecting our ability to consummate the Merger, then such injunctive or other relief may prevent the Merger from becoming effective within the expected timeframe or at all.\nThe announcement of, or a failure to complete, the Offer and the Merger could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations or our stock price.\nOur announcement of having entered into the Merger Agreement could cause a material disruption to our business and there can be no assurance that the conditions to the completion of the Offer and the Merger will be satisfied. The Merger Agreement also contains certain termination rights for us and IDT, including that either party may terminate the Merger Agreement if the Offer expires or is terminated or withdrawn pursuant to its terms without any Shares being purchased thereunder. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, GigPeak may be required, at IDT\u2019s option, to reimburse IDT for up to $4,000,000 of expenses related to the Transaction (the \u201cExpense Reimbursement\u201d). GigPeak may also be required to pay to IDT a termination fee of $9,250,000 in certain circumstances, including if IDT terminates the Merger Agreement due to a change in the recommendation of our Board of Directors (the \u201cBreakup Fee\u201d). The Breakup Fee would be reduced by the amount of any Expense Reimbursement previously paid to IDT.\nAccordingly, there is no assurance that the Merger will occur on the terms and timeline currently contemplated or at all, or that the conditions to the Merger will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all. We may be subject to several risks as a result of the announcement of, a failure to consummate, or a significant delay in consummating the Merger Agreement and the Offer, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nif the Offer and the Merger are not completed, the share price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects an assumption that the Offer and the Merger will be completed;\n\u00b7\ncertain costs related to the Offer and the Merger, including the fees and/or expenses of our legal, accounting and financial advisors, must be paid even if the Merger is not completed;\n\u00b7\npursuant to the Merger Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the Merger, which restrictions could adversely affect our ability to realize certain of our business strategies or take advantage of certain business opportunities;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to retain certain key employees who may have sought and obtained different employment in anticipation of the completion of the Offer and the Merger;\n\u00b7\nsales of our products may be negatively impacted if we experience sales force turnover as a result of the announcement of the Offer and the Merger;\n\u00b7\nthe announcement and pendency of the Offer and Merger may make it more difficult to establish or maintain relationships with employees, customers, vendors and other business partners;\n\u00b7\nthe attention of our management may be directed toward the completion of the Offer and the Merger, and related matters, and may be diverted from day-to-day business operations, including from other opportunities that might otherwise be beneficial to us;\n\u00b7\nstockholder litigation in connection with the Offer or the Merger may result in significant costs of defense, indemnification and liability; and\n\u00b7\na failure of the Offer and the Merger may result in negative publicity or a negative impression of us in the investment community or business community generally.\nShould any of these matters occur, they could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or stock price.\nSome of our directors and executive officers have interests in the Offer and the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of our other stockholders.\nOur stockholders should be aware that certain of our directors and executive officers have arrangements that provide them with interests in the Offer and the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of other stockholders. Our executive officers are party to existing employment agreements that provide for certain severance and bonus payments in the event of their qualifying termination in connection with the proposed Merger and certain of our executive officers have entered into agreements with IDT for the employment of such individuals by IDT contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, our directors and executive officers hold stock options and restricted stock units that will vest immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger. Our directors and executive officers also have certain rights to indemnification and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance that will remain following the completion of the proposed Merger.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us prior to the completion of the Offer and the Merger.\nThe Merger Agreement contains restrictions on our ability to obtain a third-party proposal for an acquisition of our Company. These provisions include our agreement not to solicit or initiate any additional discussions with third parties regarding other proposals to acquire us, as well as restrictions on our ability to respond to such proposals, subject to fulfillment of certain fiduciary requirements of our board of directors. The Merger Agreement also contains certain termination rights, including, under certain circumstances, a requirement for us to pay to IDT the Breakup Fee.\nThese provisions might discourage an otherwise-interested third party from considering or proposing an acquisition of our company, even one that may be deemed of greater value to our stockholders than the Offer. Furthermore, even if a third party elects to propose an acquisition, the concept of a Breakup Fee may result in that third party\u2019s offering a lower value to our stockholders than such third-party might otherwise have offered.\nThe price of our stock may be volatile during the pending acquisition by IDT, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our common stock may at times be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to other factors, these factors may include the timing and process for completion of Merger, including potential delays, such as those potentially caused by pending lawsuit(s) brought by purported holders of our common stock challenging our Board of Directors\u2019 actions in connection with the proposed Merger, which may cause significant fluctuations in the price of our stock.", "PERMNO": 13340, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "GIG.1"}
