{"cik": "95552", "company": "SUPERIOR INDUSTRIES INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-05", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains \u201cforward-looking\u201d statements, which may be important to understanding any statement in this Annual Report or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d)\u201d and Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report.\nOur business routinely encounters and addresses risks and uncertainties. Our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by the factors described below. Discussion about the important operational risks that our business encounters can also be found in the MD&A section and in the business description in Item 1, \u201cBusiness\u201d of this Annual Report. Below, we have described our present view of the most significant risks and uncertainties we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently do not consider significant, could also potentially impair our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our reactions to these risks and uncertainties as well as our competitors\u2019 and customers\u2019 reactions will affect our future operating results.\nIndustry and Economic Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted, and may continue to disrupt our business, which we expect will have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nTo date, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a widespread health crisis, resulting in an economic downturn and government imposed measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. In Europe and North America (our primary markets), federal, state and local governments have either recommended or mandated actions to slow the transmission of COVID-19. Most U.S. states and most countries have been implementing shelter-in-place orders, quarantines, significant restrictions on travel, as well as work restrictions that prohibit non-essential employees from going to work. The impact of COVID-19 and uncertainty with respect to the economic effects of the pandemic has introduced significant volatility in the financial markets and is having a widespread adverse effect on the automotive industry. Specific risks to our Company associated with the COVID-19 pandemic include the following:\n\u2022\nreductions in both consumer demand for vehicles and OEM automotive production, due to lower consumer confidence, may decrease demand for our products;\n\u2022\nOEMs may shift production to lower trim-levels or delay new product launches that result in the manufacture of less expensive light-vehicle products, which generally would decrease demand for our larger and/or premium wheel finishes that have higher average profit margins;\n\u2022\nOEMs may adjust their supply chains to eliminate reliance on certain suppliers, including Superior, based on credit rating agencies\u2019 assessments of suppliers;\n\u2022\nfurther deterioration of worldwide credit and financial markets could limit our ability to factor customer receivables, or end-consumers\u2019 ability to obtain financing to purchase new vehicles;\n\u2022\nthe uncertainties associated with COVID-19 impacts on the automotive sector coupled with our negative equity position and a NYSE de-listing notification (as described below), may result in a decrease in (or elimination of) credit insurance available to our European and North American suppliers causing adverse payment term changes with our suppliers;\n\u2022\ndisruptions to our supply chain in connection with the sourcing of materials and equipment from efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19;\n\u2022\nnegative impacts to our operations, including reductions in production volumes and production efficiency levels and increased costs resulting from our efforts and the efforts of federal, state and local governments to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and to protect our employees\u2019 health and well-being;\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of COVID-19 incidents at our customers\u2019 facilities or in our facilities may interrupt our customers\u2019 and our operations for an indeterminate period of time;\n\u2022\nthe temporary or permanent closure of our customers\u2019 facilities or our facilities.\nThe ultimate impact that COVID-19 will have on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will depend on a number of evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; the impact of recent resurgences of COVID-19 cases in North America and Europe, the efficacy and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, governmental, OEMs\u2019, suppliers\u2019, customers\u2019 and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic and the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and actions taken in response to such impact by the OEMs\u2019 suppliers and customers.\nThe automotive industry is cyclical and volatility in the automotive industry could adversely affect our financial performance.\nPredominantly, our sales are made to the European and U.S. automotive markets. Therefore, our financial performance depends largely on conditions in the European and U.S. automotive industry, which in turn can be affected significantly by broad economic and financial market conditions. Consumer demand for automobiles is subject to considerable volatility as a result of consumer confidence in general economic conditions, levels of employment, prevailing wages, fuel prices and the availability and cost of consumer credit, as well as changing consumer preferences. Demand for aluminum wheels can be further affected by other factors, including pricing and performance comparisons to competitive materials such as steel. Finally, the demand for our products is influenced by shifts of market share between vehicle manufacturers and the market penetration of the specific vehicle models being sold by our customers. Decreases in demand for automobiles in Europe and the United States could adversely affect the valuation of our productive assets, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and efforts by our competitors to gain market share could adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe global automotive component supply industry is highly competitive. Competition is based on a number of factors, including delivery, overall customer service, price, quality, technology and available capacity to meet customer demands. Some of our competitors are companies, or divisions or subsidiaries of companies, which are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we do. We cannot ensure that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of these competitors. In particular, our ability to maintain or increase manufacturing capacity typically requires significant investments in facilities, equipment and personnel. Additionally, as a result of evolving customer requirements, we may incur labor costs at premium rates, experience increased maintenance expenses or have to replace our machinery and equipment on an accelerated basis. Furthermore, the nature of the markets in which we compete has attracted new entrants, particularly from low-cost countries. As a result, our sales levels and margins continue to be adversely affected by pricing pressures reflective of significant competition from producers located in low-cost foreign markets, such as China. Such competition with lower cost structures poses a significant threat to our ability to compete internationally and domestically. These factors have led to our customers awarding business to foreign competitors in the past, and they may continue to do so in the future. In addition, any of our competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately, develop products that are superior to our products, have the ability to produce similar products at a lower cost or adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. Consequently, our products may not be able to compete successfully with competitors\u2019 products.\nRisks Relating to our Business, Strategy and Operations\nA limited number of customers represent a large percentage of our sales. The loss of a significant customer or decrease in demand could adversely affect our operating results.\nGM, VW Group, Ford, Daimler Group, Volvo, BMW and Toyota, together, represented 82 percent in 2020 and 79 percent of our sales in 2019. Increasingly global procurement practices, the pace of new vehicle introduction and demand for price reductions may make it more difficult to maintain long-term supply arrangements with our customers, and there are no guarantees that we will be able to negotiate supply arrangements with our customers on terms acceptable to us in the future. The contracts we have entered into with most of our customers provide that we will manufacture wheels for a particular vehicle model, rather than manufacture a specific quantity of products. Such contracts range from one year to the life of the model (usually three to five years), typically are non-exclusive and do not require the purchase by the customer of any minimum number of wheels from us. Therefore, a significant decrease in consumer demand for certain key models or group of related models sold by any of our major customers, or a decision by a manufacturer not to purchase from us, or to discontinue purchasing from us, for a particular model or group of models, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to successfully launch new products and/or achieve technological advances which could adversely affect our ability to compete resulting in an adverse impact on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nIn order to compete effectively in the global automotive component supply industry, we must be able to launch new products and adopt technology to meet our customers\u2019 demands in a timely manner. However, we cannot ensure that we will be able to install and certify the equipment needed for new product programs in time for the start of production, or that the transitioning of our manufacturing facilities and resources under new product programs will not impact production rates or other operational efficiency measures at our facilities. In addition, we cannot ensure that our customers will execute the launch of their new product programs on schedule. We are also subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications, including lack of market acceptance, delays in product development and failure of products to operate properly. The global automotive industry is experiencing a period of significant technological change. As a result, the success of our business requires us to develop and/or incorporate leading technologies. Such technologies are subject to rapid obsolescence. Our inability to maintain access to these technologies (either through development or licensing) may adversely affect our ability to compete. If we are unable to differentiate our products, maintain a low-cost footprint or compete effectively with technology-focused new market entrants, we may lose market share or be forced to reduce prices, thereby lowering our margins. Any such occurrences could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nIncreases in the costs and restrictions on availability of raw materials could adversely affect our operating margins and cash flow.\nGenerally, we obtain our raw materials, supplies and energy requirements from various sources. Although we currently maintain alternative sources, our business is subject to the risk of price increases and periodic delays in delivery. Fluctuations in the prices of raw materials may be driven by the supply and demand for that commodity or governmental regulation, including trade laws and tariffs. In addition, if any of our suppliers seek bankruptcy relief or otherwise cannot continue their business as anticipated, the availability or price of raw materials could be adversely affected.\nAlthough we are able to periodically pass certain aluminum cost increases on to our customers, we may not be able to pass along all changes in aluminum costs (e.g. for aftermarket), or there may be a delay in passing the aluminum costs onto our customers. Our customers are not obligated to accept energy or other supply cost increases that we may attempt to pass along to them. This inability to pass on these cost increases to our customers could adversely affect our operating margins and cash flows.\nAluminum and alloy pricing, and the timing of our receipt of payment from customers for aluminum price fluctuations, may have a material effect on our operating margins and cash flows.\nThe cost of aluminum is a significant component in the overall cost of our wheels and in our selling prices to customers. Customer prices are adjusted for fluctuations in aluminum prices based on changes in certain published market indices, but the timing of price adjustments is based on specific customer agreements and can vary from monthly to quarterly. As a result, the timing of aluminum price adjustments with customers flowing through sales rarely will match the timing of such changes in cost and can result in fluctuations to our gross profit. This is especially true during periods of frequent increases or decreases in the market price of aluminum.\nThe aluminum we use to manufacture wheels also contains additional alloy materials, including silicon. The cost of alloying materials is also a component of the overall cost of a wheel. The price of the alloys we purchase is also based on certain published market indices; however, most of our customer agreements do not provide price adjustments for changes in market prices of alloying materials. Increases or decreases in the market prices of these alloying materials could have a material effect on our operating margins and cash flows.\nWe experience continual pressure to reduce costs and if we are unable to generate sufficient cost reductions our revenues, operating margins and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nThe global vehicle market is highly competitive at the OEM level, which drives continual cost-cutting initiatives by our customers. Customer concentration, relative supplier fragmentation and product commoditization have translated into continual pressure from OEMs to reduce the price of our products. It is possible that pricing pressures beyond our expectations could intensify as OEMs pursue restructuring and cost-cutting initiatives. If we are unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset such price reductions, our operating margins and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, changes in OEMs\u2019 purchasing policies or payment practices could have an adverse effect on our business. Our OEM customers typically attempt to qualify more than one supplier for the vehicle programs we participate on and for programs we may bid on in the future. As such, our OEM customers are able to negotiate favorable pricing or may decrease wheel orders from us. Such actions may result in decreased sales volumes and unit price reductions for the Company, resulting in lower revenues, operating margins and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to successfully implement cost-saving measures or achieve expected benefits under our plans to improve operations which could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flow.\nAs part of our ongoing focus to provide high quality products, we continually analyze our business to further improve our operations and identify cost-cutting measures. We may be unable to successfully identify or implement plans targeting these initiatives or fail to realize the benefits of the plans we have already implemented, as a result of operational difficulties, a weakening of the economy or other factors. Cost reductions may not fully offset decreases in the prices of our products due to the time required to develop and implement cost reduction initiatives. Additional factors such as inconsistent customer ordering patterns, increasing product complexity and heightened quality standards are making it increasingly more difficult to reduce our costs. It is possible that the costs we incur to implement improvement strategies may negatively impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain key personnel, including our senior management team, which may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to attract, hire, train and retain qualified managerial, operational, engineering, sales and marketing personnel. We face significant competition for these types of employees in our industry. We may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining the personnel we require to conduct our operations successfully. In addition, key personnel may leave us and compete against us. Our success also depends, to a significant extent, on the continued service of our senior management team. During the last several years we have experienced significant turnover in our senior management members, additional losses of members of our senior management team or other experienced senior employees could impair our ability to execute our business plans and strategic initiatives, cause us to lose customers and experience lower revenues, or lead to employee morale problems and/or the loss of other key employees.\nPurchase of additional shares of Superior Industries Europe AG (formerly UNIWHEELS, AG) may require a higher purchase price.\nSuperior executed a Domination and Profit Loss Transfer Agreement, \u201cDPLTA\u201d, which became effective in January 2018. According to the terms of the DPLTA, we offered to purchase any outstanding shares of UNIWHEELS, AG for cash consideration of \u20ac62.18 per share. The cash consideration paid to shareholders for shares tendered under the DPTLA may be subject to change based on appraisal proceedings that the minority shareholders of UNIWHEELS, AG have initiated.\nLegal, Compliance and Regulatory Risks\nWe are from time to time subject to litigation, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to litigation in the ordinary course of our business. We are exposed to potential product liability and warranty risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of automotive products, the failure of which could result in property damage, personal injury or death. Accordingly, individual or class action suits alleging product liability or warranty claims could result. Although we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance in excess of our self-insured amounts, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or that such insurance will provide adequate protection against future liabilities. In addition, if any of our products prove to be defective, we may be required to participate in a recall. A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage, if any, or a requirement to participate in any product recall, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nOur business requires extensive product development activities to launch new products. Accordingly, there is a risk that wheels under development may not be ready by the start of production or may fail to meet the customer\u2019s specifications. In any such case, warranty or compensation claims might be raised, or litigation might be commenced, against the Company.\nMoreover, there are risks related to civil liability under our customer supply contracts (civil liability clauses in contracts with customers, contractual risks related to civil liability for causing delay in production launch, etc.). If we fail to ensure production launch as and when required by the customer, thus jeopardizing production processes at the customer\u2019s facilities, this could lead to increased costs, giving rise to recourse claims against, or causing loss of orders by the Company. This could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nInternational trade agreements and our international operations make us vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries that can affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe predominantly manufacture our products in Mexico, Germany and Poland and we sell our products internationally. Accordingly, unfavorable changes in foreign cost structures, trade protection laws, tariffs on aluminum or wheels, regulations and policies affecting trade and investments and social, political, labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region, among other factors, could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations. Legal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions worldwide. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. Although we have policies, controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors, or agents may violate our policies.\nIt remains unclear what the U.S. administration or foreign governments, including China, will or will not do with respect to tariffs or other international trade agreements and policies. The free trade agreement between the United States of America, the United Mexican States and Canada (the \u201cUSMCA\u201d) was approved, ratified and became effective July 1, 2020. The USMCA includes several provisions relating to automobile manufacturing. One provision requires that automobiles must have 75 percent of their components manufactured in Mexico, the United States, or Canada by 2023 to qualify for zero tariffs (up from 62.5 percent under NAFTA). Another provision requires vehicle producers to certify that 40 percent to 45 percent of automobile parts are made by workers who earn $16 per hour by 2023. Although this requirement applies to vehicle producers, our workers in Mexico currently earn less than $16 per hour. As a result, we will be unable to assist the vehicle producers with meeting this requirement. Mexico has also agreed to pass new labor laws that are intended to make it easier for Mexican workers to unionize. As a result, the USMCA may increase our cost of manufacturing in Mexico which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The USMCA must be reviewed by the member countries every six years and sunsets in sixteen years.\nA trade war, other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements, changes in United States social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently manufacture and sell products, and any resulting negative sentiments towards the United States, these territories and countries as a result of such changes, likely would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe cost of manufacturing our products in Mexico, Germany and Poland may be affected by tariffs imposed by any of these countries or the United States, trade protection laws, policies and other regulations affecting trade and investments, social, political, labor, or general economic conditions. Other factors that can affect the business and financial results of our Mexican, German and Polish operations include, but are not limited to, changes in cost structures, currency effects of the Mexican Peso, Euro and Polish Zloty, availability and competency of personnel and developments in tax regulations.\nThere is a risk of discontinuation of the European Union (E.U.) anti-dumping duty from China which may increase the competitive pressure from Chinese producers, including in the aftermarket.\nIn 2010, the European Commission imposed provisional anti-dumping duties of 22.3 percent on imports of aluminum road wheels from China after a complaint of unfair competition from European manufacturers. The European Commission argued that the EU manufacturers had suffered a significant decrease in production and sales, and a loss of market share, as well as price depression due to cheaper imports from China. On January 23, 2017, the European Commission decided to maintain the anti-dumping duties (Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/109) for another five-year period. The anti-dumping duties protect the EU producers until January 24, 2022. After this date, the competitive pressures from Chinese producers, which have cost advantages, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws.\nWe incur costs to comply with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the ordinary course of our business. We cannot ensure that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws and regulations. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in material fines or sanctions. Additionally, changes to such laws or regulations may have a significant impact on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, including those governing discharges into the air and water, the storage, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances or wastes and the health and safety of our employees. The nature of our current and former operations and the history of industrial uses at some of our facilities expose us to the risk of liabilities or claims with respect to environmental and worker health and safety matters which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nFurther, changes in legislation or regulation imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from, or otherwise impacting or limiting our equipment, operations, or the vehicles that use our products could adversely affect demand for those vehicles or require us to incur costs to become compliant with such regulations.\nCapital Structure Risks\nWe do not expect to generate sufficient cash to repay all of our indebtedness (including the Term Loan Facility and Notes) by their respective maturity dates and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy these obligations, which may not be successful. In addition, we may be unable to repay the redeemable preferred stock in the event the holder exercises its redemption rights.\nThe Company\u2019s capital structure is heavily leveraged as a result of debt incurred in connection with the 2017 acquisition of our European business. At December 31, 2020, our capital structure consisted of:\n\u2022\n$400.0 million Senior Secured Term Loan Facility (\u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d or \u201cTerm Loan B\u201d) due May 23, 2024 with an outstanding balance of $349.2 million (together with the Revolving Credit Facility referred to as the USD Senior Secured Credit Facility, \u201cUSD SSCF\u201d);\n\u2022\n\u20ac250.0 million original principal amount of 6.0% Senior Notes due June 15, 2025 (the \u201cNotes\u201d) with an outstanding balance of \u20ac217 million or $266.9 million;\n\u2022\nredeemable preferred stock of $179.4 million (unconditionally redeemable with a $300 million redemption value beginning in September 2025);\n\u2022\nequipment loans and finance leases of $27.1 million; and\n\u2022\nshareholders\u2019 deficit of $ 21.5 million.\nThe Company also had available unused commitments under its Revolving Credit Facility and European Senior Secured Credit Facility (\u201cEUR SSCF\u201d) of $228.5 million at December 31, 2020.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic, industry and competitive conditions and to certain other factors beyond our control. At the present time, we do not expect to generate sufficient cash to repay all principal due under our indebtedness, in full by the respective maturity dates, which will likely require us to refinance a portion or all of our outstanding debt. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital and credit markets and our financial condition at such time. We might not be able to refinance the debt on satisfactory terms. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and associated transactions costs and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations and limit our financial flexibility. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit ratings, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness or issue equity, or to refinance all or portions of these obligations.\nIn the absence of sufficient cash flows, refinancing or adequate funds available under credit facilities, we could face substantial liquidity constraints and might be required to reduce or delay capital expenditures, seek additional capital, sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. The credit agreements governing the USD SSCF and EUR SSCF, taken together the Global Senior Secured Credit Facilities (\u201cGSSCF\u201d), and the Indenture for the Notes restrict our ability to conduct asset sales and/or use the proceeds from asset sales. We may not be able to consummate these asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices and on terms that we believe are fair, and any proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. If we cannot meet our debt service obligations, the holders of our debt may accelerate our debt and, to the extent such debt is secured, foreclose on our assets. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay all of our debt.\nUnder the USD SSCF and EUR SSCF, we had available unused commitments of $155.2 million and $73.3 million (\u20ac59.6 million), respectively, as of December 31, 2020, which are critical to the Company\u2019s ability to pay its operating obligations in a timely manner. The credit lines under the USD SSCF and EUR SSFC will mature on May 23, 2022 and May 22, 2022, respectively, which is prior to the maturities of our other outstanding debt. We might not be able to extend these credit lines beyond the current due dates or may only be able to extend them for smaller amounts. This in turn might reduce our ability to refinance our other outstanding debt or other obligations in future years. It might also cause the rating agencies to downgrade our credit ratings. Additionally, it might require us to hold more cash in our bank accounts to ensure our ability to pay our obligations in a timely manner, which in turn could reduce our ability to pay down debt or other obligations.\nUnder the Certificate of Designations for our redeemable preferred stock, the holders have redemption rights that allow them to force us to redeem the preferred stock either as a result of the occurrence of an early redemption event (a change in control, recapitalization, merger, sale of substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets, liquidation or delisting of the Company\u2019s common stock from the NYSE) or unconditionally on or after September 14, 2025. The redemption obligation of our redeemable preferred stock consists of a redemption price equal to the greater of 2.0 times the then current Stated Value (defined in the Certificate of Designations as $150.0 million, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends or dividends paid-in-kind), currently $300.0 million, or the product of the number of common shares into which the redeemable preferred stock could be converted (5.3 million shares currently) and the then current market price of our common stock. Under Delaware law, any redemption payment would be limited to the \u201csurplus\u201d that our Board determines is available to fund a full or partial redemption without rendering us insolvent. The shares of preferred stock that have not been redeemed would continue to receive a dividend of 9 percent per annum on the then current Stated Value, as defined in the Certificate of Designations, until such shares of preferred stock are redeemed. The Board would have to evaluate on an ongoing basis the ability of the Company to make further payments until the full redemption amount has been paid. A redemption payment, if required, for some or all of our outstanding shares of preferred stock would negatively impact our liquidity and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur substantial indebtedness and the corresponding interest expense could adversely affect our financial condition\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, our total debt was $643.2 million ($631.6 million net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $11.6 million). Additionally, we had availability of $155.2 million under the USD SSCF, as well as $73.3 million (\u20ac59.6 million) under the EUR SSCF at December 31, 2020.\nA significant portion of our cash flow from operations will be used to pay our interest expense and will not be available for other business purposes. We cannot be certain that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that we will be able to enter into future financings that will provide sufficient proceeds to meet or pay the interest on our debt.\nSubject to the limits contained in the credit agreements governing our GSSCF and the indenture governing the Notes (with outstanding principal balance of $266.9 million (\u20ac217.0 million) at December 31 2020) and our other debt instruments, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify.\nIn addition, the indenture covering the Notes (the \u201cIndenture\u201d) and the credit agreements governing the GSSCF and our other debt instruments contain restrictive covenants that among other things, could limit our ability to incur liens, engage in mergers and acquisitions, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets, make investments or acquisitions, redeem our capital stock or pay dividends. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of the maturity of all of our debt.\nA downgrade of our credit rating or a decrease of the prices of the Company\u2019s common stock, the USD SSCF or the Notes could adversely impact our financial performance.\nThe Company, its USD SSCF, and the Notes, are rated by Standard and Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s. These ratings are widely followed by investors, customers, and suppliers, and a downgrade by one or both of these rating agencies might cause: suppliers to cancel our contracts, demand price increases, or decrease payment terms; customers to reduce their business activities with us; or investors to reconsider investments in financial instruments issued by Superior, all of which might cause a decrease of the price of our common stock, our Notes, or the price of the bilaterally traded Term Loan B which is a part of the USD SSCF.\nA decrease in our common stock, Notes and/or Term Loan B prices, in turn, might accelerate such negative trends. A reduction in the price of the Notes and Term Loan B implies an increase of the yield debt investors demand to provide us with financing, which, in turn, would make it more difficult for us to refinance our existing debt, redeemable preferred stock obligations and/or future debt or redeemable preferred stock obligations.\nThe terms of the credit agreement governing the GSSCF, the Indenture, and other debt instruments, as well as the documents governing other debt that we may incur in the future, may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.\nThe Indenture, the credit agreements governing the GSSCF and our other debt instruments, and the documents governing other debt that we may incur in the future, may contain a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur liens;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers or consolidations or sell all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nsell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets;\n\u2022\nmake investments, acquisitions, loans or advances or other restricted payments;\n\u2022\npay dividends or distributions, repurchase our capital stock or make certain other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem, or repurchase any subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022\ndesignate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements which limit the ability of our non-guarantor subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us;\n\u2022\nand enter into certain transactions with our affiliates.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants in the credit agreement governing the GSSCF and other debt instruments require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests to the extent subject to certain financial covenant conditions. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control. We may not meet those ratios and tests.\nA breach of the covenants or restrictions under the Indenture governing the Notes, under the credit agreement governing the GSSCF, or under other debt instruments could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors under such facility to accelerate the related debt, which may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the credit agreement governing our GSSCF would permit the lenders under our revolving credit facilities to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under these facilities. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the GSSCF or under other secured debt instruments, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral under the GSSCF. In the event our lenders or holders of the Notes accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness or be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms acceptable to us. As a result of these restrictions, we may be:\n\u2022\nlimited in how we conduct our business;\n\u2022\nunable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or\n\u2022\nunable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. These restrictions, along with restrictions that may be contained in agreements evidencing or governing other future indebtedness, may affect our ability to grow or pursue other important initiatives in accordance with our growth strategy.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our GSSCF are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $349.2 million of our debt was variable rate debt. Our anticipated annual interest expense on $349.2 million variable rate debt at the current rate of 4.1 percent would be $14.3 million. We have entered into interest rate swaps exchanging floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. As of December 31, 2020, we have executed interest rate swaps for $200.0 million, maturing $50 million September 30, 2022, and $150 million December 31, 2022. In the future, we may\nagain enter into interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in LIBOR reporting practices, the method in which LIBOR is determined or the use of alternative reference rates.\nThe interest rates under our USD SSCF are calculated using LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 and it is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established. ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (IBA), the administrator of LIBOR rates, had requested feedback by January 25, 2021 from the U.S. dollar LIBOR panel banks concerning the possibility of maintaining U.S. dollar LIBOR rates for certain tenors (one, three, six and twelve-month terms) through June 30, 2023. IBA is currently evaluating the feedback received and, at this time, no agreement has yet been reached regarding the extension of U.S. dollar LIBOR beyond December 31, 2021. If LIBOR ceases to exist, a comparable or successor reference rate as approved by the Administrative Agent under the USD SSCF will apply or such other reference rate as may be agreed by the Company and the lenders under the credit agreement governing the USD SSCF. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, is planning to replace U.S. dollar LIBOR with the secure overnight financing rate (SOFR), a newly created index, calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere. To the extent these interest rates increase, our interest expense will increase, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nA delisting of our common stock from the NYSE could reduce the liquidity and market price of our common stock; reduce the number of investors and analysts that cover our common stock; limit our ability to issue additional shares, and damage our reputation which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, a delisting of our common stock from the NYSE could cause a redemption of some or all of our outstanding redeemable preferred stock which would negatively impact our liquidity.\nWe are required under the NYSE continued listing standards to maintain a market capitalization of at least $50 million, over a consecutive 30 trading-day period, or maintain stockholders\u2019 equity of at least $50 million. As of March 31, 2020, our market capitalization was less than $50 million over a consecutive 30-day trading period and our stockholders\u2019 equity was less than the minimum threshold. As a result, on June 5, 2020, the NYSE sent us a formal notification that we were not in compliance with the NYSE continued listing standards. In response, on July 20, 2020, we submitted a remediation plan to the NYSE and on September 8, 2020 we publicly announced that our remediation plan had been accepted by the NYSE. The cure period effectively began on July 1, 2020 and will end on January 1, 2022, unless the Company earlier surpasses the $50 million market capitalization threshold for a period of six consecutive months at which point the Company would be in full compliance. In the event we are unable to cure the deficiency during the 18-month period, our stock may be delisted from the NYSE.\nA delisting of our common stock could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition by, among other things:\n\u2022\nreducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock;\n\u2022\nreducing the number of investors, including institutional investors, willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity;\n\u2022\ndecreasing the amount of news and analyst coverage relating to us;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to issue additional securities, obtain additional financing or pursue strategic restructuring, refinancing or other transactions; and\n\u2022\nimpacting our reputation and, as a consequence, our ability to attract new business.\nIn addition, the holder of our redeemable preferred stock has the right to redeem all of the outstanding shares of redeemable preferred stock if our common stock is delisted from the NYSE. If we are delisted from the NYSE and the holder exercises its right to redeem all of the outstanding shares of redeemable preferred stock, we would be required to: (1) increase the then carrying value of the redeemable preferred stock to the $300 million redemption value through a corresponding charge (decrease) to our retained earnings, and (2) make a redemption payment in any amount up to $300 million if our Board determined, under Delaware law, that there was a \u201csurplus\u201d to fund a full or partial redemption and such payment would not render us insolvent. The shares of preferred stock that have not been redeemed would continue to receive a dividend of 9 percent per annum on the Stated Value (defined in the Certificate of Designations as $150.0 million, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends or dividends paid-in-kind), currently $150.0 million, until such shares of preferred stock are redeemed. A redemption payment, if required, for some or all of our outstanding shares of preferred stock would negatively impact our liquidity and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nTaxation Risks\nWe are subject to taxation related risks in multiple jurisdictions.\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. While we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities, which may have a significant impact on our global provision for income taxes. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly subjective. Tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and, as a result, assess additional taxes against us. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision.\nIn addition, governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies. Many countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business. The impact of tax law changes could result in an overall tax rate increase to our business.\nWe may fail to comply with conditions of the state tax incentive programs in Poland.\nThe Company carries out its business activity in Poland in the area of Tarnobrzeg Special Economic Zone \u201cEuro-Park Wislosan,\u201d sub-zone of Stalowa Wola, Poland which provides various state income tax incentives under certain conditions. The Company conducts its business activity pursuant to permits that stipulate production, trade, and service activities relating to products and services manufactured/provided in the zone. These activities include processing of metals and applying coating on metals, tools, other finished metal products, machines for metallurgy, other parts and accessories for motor vehicles, excluding motorcycles, as well as services relating to recovery of segregated materials and recycled materials. The permits require certain conditions to be met, which include increasing the number of employees, keeping the number of employees at such level and incurring certain levels of capital expenditures. In addition, particular permits indicate deadlines for completion of respective stages of investments.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had 5 permits that are effective until 2026, and we believe all conditions of the permits have been met. As of December 31, 2020, the Company utilized Polish Zloty 139.3 million of the zone-related credit and the total amount of the remaining eligible credit available to the Company amounted to Polish Zloty 50.0 million. In the event of failure to satisfy the permit conditions, the Company must reimburse the utilized public aid received together with interest which may have a material negative impact on our assets, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nTax settlements and other areas of activity subject to specific regulations (e.g. customs or FX issues) may be inspected by administrative bodies which are entitled to impose penalties and sanctions. Tax regulations in Poland are dynamic and subject to varying interpretations, both inside state authorities and between state authorities and enterprises, which can result in a lack of clarity and consistent application. As a result, tax risks in Poland are higher than in countries with a more developed tax system. Tax settlements may be subject to inspections for five years from the end of the year in which the tax has been paid. Consequently, the Company may be subject to additional material tax liabilities, based on the result of these tax audits.\nWe are currently unable to fully deduct interest charges on German and US indebtedness.\nThe interest deduction barriers under German tax law (Zinsschranke) and US tax law limit the tax deductibility of interest expenses. If no exception to these limits apply, the net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) is deductible up to 30 percent of the EBITDA taxable in Germany and the US, respectively, in a given financial year. Non-deductible interest expenses can be carried forward. Interest carry-forwards are subject to the same tax cancellation rules as tax loss carry-forwards. Whenever interest expenses are not deductible or if an interest carry-forward is lost, the tax burden in future assessment periods could rise, which might have alone, or in combination, a material adverse effect on our assets, financial condition, results of operation or cash flows.\nWe may be exposed to risks related to existing and future profit and loss transfer agreements executed with German subsidiaries of our European operations.\nProfit and loss transfer agreements are one of the prerequisites of the taxation of Superior and its German subsidiaries as a German tax group. For tax purposes, a profit and loss transfer agreement must have a contract term for a minimum of five years. In addition, such agreement must be fully executed. If a profit and loss transfer agreement or its actual execution does not meet the prerequisites for taxation as a German tax group, Superior Industries International Germany GmbH (\u201cSII Germany\u201d), formerly known as Superior Industries International AG, and each subsidiary are taxed on their own income (and under certain circumstances even with retrospective effect). Additionally, 5 percent of dividends from the subsidiary to SII Germany, or other Superior European controlling entities within the European Union would be regarded as non-deductible expenses at the SII Germany level, or level of other Superior European controlling entities. Furthermore, the compensation of a loss of a subsidiary would be regarded as a contribution by SII\nGermany into the subsidiary and thus, would not directly reduce SII Germany\u2019s profits. As a consequence, if the profit and loss transfer agreements do not meet the prerequisites of a German tax group, this could have a future material adverse effect on our assets, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nFluctuations in foreign currencies and commodity and energy prices may adversely impact our financial results.\nDue to our operations outside of the United States, we experience exposure to foreign currency gains and losses in the ordinary course of our business. We settle transactions between currencies (i.e. U.S. dollar to Mexican Peso, Euro to U.S. dollar, U.S. dollar to Euro and Euro to Polish Zloty.) To the extent possible, we attempt to match the timing and magnitude of transaction settlements between currencies to create a \u201cnatural hedge.\u201d Based on our current business model and levels of production and sales activity, the net imbalance between currencies depends on specific circumstances. While changes in the terms of the contracts with our customers will create an imbalance between currencies that we hedge with foreign currency forward or option contracts, there can be no assurances that our hedging program will effectively offset the impact of the imbalance between currencies or that the net transaction balance will not change significantly in the future.\nAdditionally, we are exposed to commodity and energy price risks due to significant aluminum raw material requirements and the energy intensive nature of our operations. Natural gas and electricity prices are subject a to large number of variables that are outside of our control. We use financial derivatives and fixed-price agreements with suppliers to reduce the effect of any volatility on our financial results.\nThe foreign currency forward or option contracts, the natural gas forward contracts, and the fixed-price agreements we enter into with financial institutions and suppliers are designed to protect against foreign exchange risks and price risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions and forecasted future cash flows. We have a program to hedge a significant portion of our foreign exchange or commodity and energy price exposures, typically for up to 48 months. However, we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange or commodity or energy price exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations, the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, or our inability to identify willing counterparties. There is no guarantee that our hedge program will effectively mitigate our exposures to foreign exchange and commodity and energy price changes which could have material adverse effects on our cash flows and results of operations.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may also affect the USD value of assets and liabilities of our foreign operations, as well as assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies such as the Euro, and may adversely affect reported earnings and, accordingly, the comparability of period-to-period results of operations. Changes in currency exchange rates or commodity and energy prices may affect the relative prices at which we and our foreign competitors sell products in the same market. In addition, changes in the value of the relevant currencies or commodities and energy prices may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations. We cannot ensure that fluctuations in exchange rates or commodities and energy prices will not otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of operations.\nA disruption in our information technology systems, including a disruption related to cybersecurity, could adversely affect our financial condition and financial performance.\nWe rely on the accuracy, capacity and security of our information technology systems. Despite the security measures that we have implemented, including those measures related to cybersecurity, our systems, as well as those of our customers, suppliers and other service providers could be breached or damaged by computer viruses, malware, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, natural or man-made incidents or disasters or unauthorized physical or electronic access. These types of incidents have become more prevalent and pervasive across industries, including in our industry, and are expected to continue in the future. A breach could result in business disruption, theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or customer information and unauthorized access to personnel information. Although cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes, practices and training designed to protect our information technology systems from attack, damage or unauthorized access are a high priority for us, our activities and investment may not be deployed quickly enough or successfully protect our systems against all vulnerabilities, including technologies developed to bypass our security measures. In addition, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers to disclose access credentials or other sensitive information in order to gain access to our secure systems and networks. There are no assurances that our actions and investments to improve the maturity of our systems, processes and risk management framework or remediate vulnerabilities will be sufficient or completed quickly enough to prevent or limit the impact of any cyber intrusion. Moreover, because the techniques used to gain access to or sabotage systems often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate the methods necessary to defend against these types of attacks and we cannot predict the extent, frequency or impact these problems may have on us. To the extent that our business is interrupted or data is lost, destroyed or inappropriately used or disclosed, such disruptions could adversely affect our competitive position, relationships with our customers,\nfinancial condition, operating results and cash flows. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against the damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nWe are also dependent on security measures that some of our third-party customers, suppliers and other service providers take to protect their own systems and infrastructures. Some of these third parties store or have access to certain of our sensitive data, as well as confidential information about their own operations, and as such are subject to their own cybersecurity threats. Any security breach of any of these third-parties\u2019 systems could result in unauthorized access to our information technology systems, cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nCompetitors could copy our products or technologies and we could violate protected intellectual property rights or trade secrets of our competitors or other third parties.\nWe register business-related intellectual property rights, such as industrial designs and trademarks, hold licenses and other agreements covering the use of intellectual property rights, and have taken steps to ensure that our trade secrets and technological know-how remain confidential. Nevertheless, there is a risk that third parties would attempt to copy, in full or in part, our products, technologies or industrial designs, or to obtain unauthorized access and use of Company secrets, technological know-how or other protected intellectual property rights. Also, other companies could successfully develop technologies, products or industrial designs similar to ours, and thus potentially compete with us.\nFurther, there can be no assurance that we will not unknowingly infringe intellectual property rights of our competitors, such as patents and industrial designs, especially due to the fact that the interpretations of what constitutes protected intellectual property may differ. Similarly, there is a risk that we will illegitimately use intellectual property developed by our employees, which is subject in each case to relevant regulations governing employee-created innovations. If a dispute concerning intellectual property rights arises, in which the relevant court issues an opinion on the disputed intellectual property rights contrary to us, identifying a breach of intellectual property rights, we may be required to pay substantial damages or to stop the use of such intellectual property. In addition, we are exposed to the risk of injunctions being imposed to prevent further infringement, leading to a decrease in the number of customer orders.\nAll these events could have a material adverse effect on our assets, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.", "PERMNO": 52396, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "SUP"}
