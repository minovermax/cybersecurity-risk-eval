RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to various risks that could have a negative effect on us and our financial condition. These risks could cause actual operating results to differ from those expressed in certain \u201cforward looking statements\u201d contained in this Annual Report as well as in other communications.\nSummary of Risk Factors\n\u25cf\nWe have never generated any product revenues.\n\u25cf\nWe expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\n\u25cf\nWe will need substantial additional funding, and certain terms included in our financing transactions may restrict our ability to raise such capital at the times and in the manner we may require.\n\u25cf\nTo date, most of our development activities have been focused on our MS1819 product candidate, which is still under clinical development, and if MS1819 does not receive regulatory approval or is not successfully commercialized, our business will be harmed.\n\u25cf\nThe COVID-19 outbreak and global pandemic could adversely impact our business, including our clinical trials.\n\u25cf\nWe will require additional capital to fund our operations, and if we fail to obtain necessary financing, we may not be able to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\n\u25cf\nClinical trials are very expensive, time-consuming, difficult to design and implement and involve an uncertain outcome.\n\u25cf\nWe face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\n\u25cf\nWe do not have our own manufacturing capabilities and will rely on third parties to produce clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates.\n\u25cf\nWe intend to rely on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical trials, and if those third parties perform in an unsatisfactory manner, it may harm our business.\n\u25cf\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets.\n\u25cf\nWe are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act and have taken advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies; this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.\n\u25cf\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future, and consequently, any gains from an investment in our Common Stock will likely depend on appreciation in the price of our Common Stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company and have a limited operating history upon which to base an investment decision.\nWe are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company. Since inception, we have engaged primarily in research and development activities of our lead drug candidate, MS1819 and our other drug candidates. We have not generated any revenue from product sales and have incurred significant net losses. We have not demonstrated our ability to perform the functions necessary for the successful commercialization of any drug candidates. The successful commercialization of any of our products will require us to perform a variety of functions, including:\n\u25cf\ncontinuing to undertake pre-clinical development and clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nparticipating in regulatory approval processes;\n\u25cf\nformulating and manufacturing products; and\n\u25cf\nconducting sales and marketing activities.\nOur operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing, acquiring, developing and securing the proprietary rights for, and undertaking pre-clinical development and clinical trials of MS1819, the acquisition of rights to niclosamide and our other drug candidates. These operations provide a limited basis for our stockholders and prospective investors to assess our ability to complete development of or commercialize MS1819, niclosamide or any other drug candidates and the advisability of investing in our securities.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception. As of December 31, 2020, we had accumulated deficit of approximately $95.4 million and negative working capital of approximately $7.7 million. Based on our historical and anticipated rate of cash expenditures, we do not anticipate our working capital will be sufficient to sustain our business through the successful commercialization of our drug candidates. Therefore, we are dependent on obtaining, and are continuing to pursue, the necessary funding from outside sources, including obtaining additional funding from the sale of securities in order to continue our operations. We are actively working to obtain additional funding. We cannot make any assurances that additional financings will be available to us and, if available, completed on a timely basis, on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to complete an equity and/or debt offering, or otherwise obtain sufficient financing when and if needed, it would negatively impact our business and operations, which would likely cause the price of our Common Stock to decline or ultimately force us to cease our operations.\nOur product candidates are at an early stage of development and may not be successfully developed or commercialized.\nWe have no products approved for sale. MS1819, our lead drug candidate, and niclosamide , which we recently acquired, are in the early stages of clinical development and our other drug candidates are still in preclinical phase. Our drug candidates will require substantial further capital expenditures, development, testing, and regulatory clearances prior to commercialization. The development and regulatory approval process take several years, and it is not likely that any such products, even if successfully developed and approved by the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority, would be commercially available until at least 2022 or beyond. Of the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage successfully completes the regulatory approval process and is commercialized. Accordingly, even if we are able to obtain the requisite financing to fund our development programs, we cannot assure you that our drug candidates will be successfully developed or commercialized. Our failure to develop, manufacture or receive regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize any of our drug candidates, could result in the failure of our business and a loss of all of your investment in our company.\nAny product candidates we advance into and through clinical development are subject to extensive regulation, which can be costly and time consuming, cause unanticipated delays or prevent the receipt of the required approvals to commercialize our product candidates.\nThe clinical development, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing and distribution of our drug candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and by comparable health authorities in foreign markets, including Health Canada\u2019s Therapeutic Products Directorate, or the TPD, and the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA. In the United States, we are not permitted to market our drug candidates until we receive approval of an NDA (New Drug Application) or BLA (Biologic License Application) from the FDA. The process of obtaining such approval is expensive, often takes many years and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the products involved. In addition to the significant clinical testing requirements, our ability to obtain marketing approval for these drug candidates depends on obtaining the final results of required non-clinical testing, including characterization of the manufactured components of our drug candidates and validation of our manufacturing processes. The FDA may determine that our product manufacturing processes, testing procedures or facilities are insufficient to justify approval. Approval policies or regulations may change, and the FDA has substantial discretion in the pharmaceutical approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons. Despite the time and expense invested in clinical development of drug candidates, regulatory approval is never guaranteed.\nThe FDA, the TPD and/or the EMA can delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\ndisagreement with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nfailure to demonstrate to their satisfaction that a product candidate is safe and effective for any indication;\n\u25cf\nfailure to accept clinical data from trials which are conducted outside their jurisdiction;\n\u25cf\nthe results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required for approval;\n\u25cf\nwe may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u25cf\nsuch agencies may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nfailure to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we or our collaborators contract for clinical and commercial supplies; or\n\u25cf\nchanges in the approval policies or regulations of such agencies may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nAny delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing our drug candidates.\nIf we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nWe may experience difficulties in patient enrollment in our clinical trials for a variety of reasons. The timely completion of clinical trials in accordance with their protocols depends, among other things, on our ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who remain in the trial until its conclusion. The enrollment of patients depends on many factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe patient eligibility criteria defined in the protocol;\n\u25cf\nthe size of the patient population;\n\u25cf\nthe proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients;\n\u25cf\nthe design of the trial;\n\u25cf\nour ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n\u25cf\nour ability to obtain and maintain patient consents; and\n\u25cf\nthe risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the trials before completion.\nOur clinical trials will compete with other clinical trials for drug candidates that are in the same therapeutic areas as our drug candidates. This competition will reduce the number and types of patients and qualified clinical investigators available to us, because some patients who might have opted to enroll in our trials may instead opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by one of our competitors or clinical trial sites may not allow us to conduct our clinical trial at such site if competing trials are already being conducted there. Since the number of qualified clinical investigators is limited, we expect to conduct some of our clinical trials at the same clinical trial sites that some of our competitors use, which will reduce the number of patients who are available for our clinical trials in such clinical trial site. We may also encounter difficulties finding a clinical trial site at which to conduct our trials.\nDelays in patient enrollment may result in increased costs or may affect the timing or outcome of our planned clinical trials, which could prevent completion of these clinical trials and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of our drug candidates.\nBecause the results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, any product candidate we advance into clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials, if any, or receive regulatory approval.\nPharmaceutical development has inherent risk. We will be required to demonstrate through well-controlled clinical trials that our drug candidates are effective with a favorable benefit-risk profile for use in their target indications before we can seek regulatory approvals for their commercial sale. Our lead drug candidate, MS1819, has only completed two Phase 2 clinical trials in two separate indications (one Phase 2 in CF patients and one Phase 2 in CP patients). Niclosamide has completed a Phase 1b/2a study, conducted by First Wave, in patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis but has not completed a study in an indication that we intend on pursuing (ICI-AC and COVID-19 GI). Success in pre-clinical studies or early clinical trials does not mean that later clinical trials will be successful, as drug candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety or efficacy despite having progressed through initial clinical testing. We also may need to conduct additional clinical trials that are not currently anticipated. Companies frequently suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials have shown promising results.\nAny product candidate we advance into and through clinical trials may cause unacceptable adverse events or have other properties that may delay or prevent their regulatory approval or commercialization or limit their commercial potential.\nUnacceptable adverse events caused by MS1819, niclosamide and our other drug candidates in clinical trials could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications and markets. This, in turn, could prevent us from commercializing the affected product candidate and generating revenues from its sale. We have not yet completed testing of any of our drug candidates for the treatment of the indications for which we intend to seek product approval in humans, and we currently do not know the extent of adverse events, if any, that will be observed in patients who receive any of our drug candidates. If any of our drug candidates cause unacceptable adverse events in clinical trials, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval or commercialize such product or, if such product candidate is approved for marketing, future adverse events could cause us to withdraw such product from the market.\nDelays in the commencement or completion of our clinical trials could result in increased costs and delay our ability to pursue regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates.\nAlthough we commenced the ongoing Combination Trial in 2019 and the OPTION 2 Trial in 2020, the commencement and completion of clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in:\n\u25cf\nobtaining regulatory clearance to commence a clinical trial;\n\u25cf\nidentifying, recruiting and training suitable clinical investigators;\n\u25cf\nreaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation, may be subject to modification from time to time and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u25cf\nobtaining sufficient quantities of investigational product (\u201cIP \u201d) for our drug candidates for use in clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nobtaining Institutional Review Board (\u201cIRB \u201d) or ethics committee approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site;\n\u25cf\nidentifying, recruiting and enrolling patients to participate in a clinical trial, including delays and/or interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, disease or public health epidemics, such as the coronavirus, or natural disasters;\n\u25cf\nretaining patients who have initiated a clinical trial but may withdraw due to adverse events from the therapy, insufficient efficacy, changing clinical protocols, fatigue with the clinical trial process, or personal issues;\n\u25cf\nretaining patients who may not follow the clinical trial protocols due to factors including the coronavirus epidemic; and\n\u25cf\navailability of funds.\nAny delays in the commencement of our clinical trials will delay our ability to pursue regulatory approval for our drug candidates. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.\nIf we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nThe timely completion of clinical trials in accordance with their protocols depends, among other things, on our ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who remain in the trial until its conclusion. We may experience difficulties in patient enrollment in our clinical trials for a variety of reasons, including the size and nature of the patient population and the patient eligibility criteria defined in the protocol, competition from competing companies, and natural disasters or public health epidemics, such as the coronavirus impacting the U.S., Europe and elsewhere.\nOur clinical trials will likely compete with other clinical trials for drug candidates that are in the same therapeutic areas as our drug candidates, and this competition will reduce the number and types of patients available to us, because some patients who might have opted to enroll in our trials may instead opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by one of our competitors. Because the number of qualified clinical investigators and clinical trial sites is limited, we expect to conduct some of our clinical trials at the same clinical trial sites that some of our competitors may use, which will reduce the number of patients who are available for our clinical trials at such clinical trial sites. Even if we are able to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials, delays in patient enrollment may result in increased costs or may affect the timing or outcome of the planned clinical trials, which could delay or prevent completion of these trials and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of MS1819, niclosamide and our other drug candidates.\nA pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak of an infectious disease, such as COVID-19, or coronavirus, may materially and adversely affect our business and our financial results.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has affected segments of the global economy and may affect our operations, including the potential interruption of our clinical trial activities and our supply chain. Beginning in March 2020, the majority of our workforce began working from home. Disruptions caused by the continued spread of COVID-19, including the effects of stay-at-home orders and work-from-home policies, have impacted productivity and may result in further periods of business disruption, including delays in our clinical trials or delays or disruptions in our supply chain. In addition, there could be a potential effect of COVID-19 to the business at FDA or other health authorities, which could result in delays of reviews and approvals, including with respect to our drug candidates.\nThe continued spread of COVID-19 globally could adversely affect our clinical trial operations in the United States and Europe and other jurisdictions where we may decide to conduct clinical trials, including our ability to recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-19 if an outbreak occurs in their geography. We have already experienced certain delays of our clinical trials and may experience further delays as the pandemic continues. Disruptions in national or international shipments and deliveries could impede our ability to distribute product to trial sites in a timely manner. Any of the foregoing factors could delay our ability to conduct clinical trials or release clinical trial results. COVID-19 may also affect employees of third-party CROs located in affected geographies that we rely upon to carry out our clinical trials, which could result in inefficiencies due to reductions in staff and disruptions to work environments.\nThe spread of COVID-19, or another infectious disease, could also negatively affect the operations at our third-party manufacturers, which could result in delays or disruptions in the supply of our drug candidates. In addition, we have taken temporary precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, including temporarily requiring all employees to work remotely, suspending all non-essential travel worldwide for our employees, and discouraging employee attendance at industry events and in-person work-related meetings, which could negatively affect our business.\nWe have implemented business continuity plans designed to address and mitigate the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our employees and our business. We continue to operate normally with the exception of enabling all of our employees to work productively at home and abiding by travel restrictions issued by federal, state and local governments. Our current plans to return to the office remain fluid as federal, state and local guidelines, rules and regulations continue to evolve.\nWe cannot presently predict the scope and severity of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions. If we or any of the third parties with whom we engage, however, were to experience shutdowns or other business disruptions, our ability to conduct our business in the manner and on the timelines presently planned could be materially and negatively affected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and our results of operation and financial condition.\nIn addition, the global spread of COVID-19 has created significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets and may materially affect us economically and such conditions continue to persist. While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, a widespread pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. A recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our Common Stock.\nWe may be required to suspend, repeat or terminate our clinical trials if they are not conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, the results are negative or inconclusive or the trials are not well designed.\nRegulatory agencies, IRBs or data safety monitoring boards may at any time recommend the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials or request that we cease using investigators in the clinical trials if they believe that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, or that they present an unacceptable safety risk to participants. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with current cGCPs or other applicable foreign government guidelines governing the design, safety monitoring, quality assurance and ethical considerations associated with clinical studies. Clinical trials are subject to oversight by the FDA, other foreign governmental agencies and IRBs at the study sites where the clinical trials are conducted. In addition, clinical trials must be conducted with drug candidates produced in accordance with applicable cGMPs, which are the FDA\u2019s regulations governing the design, monitoring and control of manufacturing processes and facilities. Clinical trials may be suspended by the FDA, other foreign governmental agencies, or us for various reasons, including:\n\u25cf\ndeficiencies in the conduct of the clinical trials, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or clinical protocols;\n\u25cf\ndeficiencies in the clinical trial operations or trial sites;\n\u25cf\nthe product candidate may have unforeseen adverse side effects;\n\u25cf\ndeficiencies in the trial design necessary to demonstrate efficacy;\n\u25cf\nfatalities or other adverse events arising during a clinical trial due to medical problems that may not be related to clinical trial treatments;\n\u25cf\nthe product candidate may not appear to be more effective than current therapies; or\n\u25cf\nthe quality or stability of the product candidate may fall below acceptable standards.\nIf we elect or are forced to suspend or terminate a clinical trial for MS1819, niclosamide or of any other drug candidates, the commercial prospects for that product candidate will be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue from that product candidate may be delayed or eliminated. Furthermore, any of these events could prevent us or our partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our drug candidates, and impair our ability to generate revenue from the commercialization of these drug candidates either by us or by our collaboration partners.\nThe approval processes of regulatory authorities are lengthy, time consuming, expensive and inherently unpredictable. If we are unable to obtain approval for our product candidates from applicable regulatory authorities, we will not be able to market and sell those product candidates in those countries or regions and our business will be substantially harmed.\nThe time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign authorities is unpredictable, but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. We have not submitted an NDA or similar filing or obtained regulatory approval for any drug candidate in any jurisdiction and it is possible that none of our existing drug candidates or any drug candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval.\nMS1819, niclosamide and our other drug candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including any one or more of the following:\n\u25cf\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nwe may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication;\n\u25cf\nthe results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval;\n\u25cf\nwe may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u25cf\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nthe data collected from clinical trials of our drug candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA, BLA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u25cf\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to hold to previous agreements or commitments;\n\u25cf\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies;\n\u25cf\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve our drug candidates;\n\u25cf\ninvest significant additional cash in each of the above activities; and;\n\u25cf\nthe approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nThe time and expense of the approval process, as well as the unpredictability of clinical trial results and other contributing factors, may result in our failure to obtain regulatory approval to market, in one or more jurisdictions, MS1819, niclosamide or future drug candidates, which would significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nWe intend to rely on third-party collaborators to market and sell our products. Our third-party collaborators may not have the resources to pursue approvals, which in turn could severely limit our potential markets and ability to generate revenue.\nIn order to market and sell our products in any jurisdiction, we or our third-party collaborators must obtain separate marketing approvals in that jurisdiction and comply with its regulatory requirements. The approval procedure can vary drastically among countries, and each jurisdiction may impose different testing and other requirements to obtain and maintain marketing approval. Further, the time required to obtain those approvals may differ substantially among jurisdictions. Approval by the FDA or an equivalent foreign authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in any other countries or jurisdictions. As a result, the ability to market and sell a product candidate in more than one jurisdiction can involve significant additional time, expense and effort to undertake separate approval processes, and could subject us and our collaborators to the numerous and varying post-approval requirements of each jurisdiction governing commercial sales, manufacturing, pricing and distribution of MS1819, niclosamide and our other drug candidates. We or any third parties with whom we may collaborate may not have the resources to pursue those approvals, and we or they may not be able to obtain any approvals that are pursued. The failure to obtain marketing approval for MS1819, niclosamide and our other drug candidates in foreign jurisdictions could severely limit their potential markets and our ability to generate revenue.\nIn addition, even if we were to obtain regulatory approval in one or more jurisdictions, regulatory authorities may approve MS1819, niclosamide and our other drug candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may not approve the prices we may propose to charge for our products, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve a product candidate with labeling that does not include the claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate. Any of the foregoing circumstances could materially harm the commercial prospects for MS1819, niclosamide and our other drug candidates.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of the approved labeling, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.\nResults of current and future clinical trials of MS1819, niclosamide and our other drug candidates could reveal a high and/or unacceptable severity and frequency of these or other side effects. In such an event, our trials could be suspended or terminated, and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of, or deny approval of, our drug candidates for any or all targeted indications. Further, any observed drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences could materially harm our business, financial condition and prospects.\nAdditionally, if MS1819, niclosamide and our other drug candidates receive marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by our products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u25cf\nregulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product;\n\u25cf\nregulatory authorities may require additional warnings in the product\u2019s labeling;\n\u25cf\nwe may be required to create a medication guide for distribution to patients that outlines the risks of such side effects;\n\u25cf\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and;\n\u25cf\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects\nIf we are unable to execute our sales and marketing strategy for our products and are unable to gain market acceptance, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to sustain our business.\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company and have yet to begin to generate revenue from MS1819, niclosamide or any of our other drug candidates. Our drug candidates are in an early stage of clinical development, and, if we obtain marketing approval for any of products in the future, which we anticipate would not occur for several years, if at all.\nAlthough we believe that MS1819 and niclosamide represent promising commercial opportunities, we may never gain significant market acceptance and therefore may never generate substantial revenue or profits for us. We will need to establish a market for MS1819, niclosamide and our other drug candidates and build that market through physician education, awareness programs and the publication of clinical data. Gaining acceptance in medical communities requires, among other things, publication in leading peer-reviewed journals of results from our studies. The process of publication in leading medical journals is subject to a peer review process and peer reviewers may not consider the results of our studies sufficiently novel or worthy of publication. Failure to have our studies published in peer-reviewed journals could limit the adoption of MS1819, niclosamide or our other drug candidates. Our ability to successfully market our drug candidates that we may develop will depend on numerous factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nthe inability to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of a product candidate outweigh any safety or other perceived risks;\n\u25cf\nconducting clinical utility studies of our drug candidates to demonstrate economic usefulness to providers and payers;\n\u25cf\nwhether our current or future partners, support our offerings;\n\u25cf\nthe success of the sales force and marketing effort;\n\u25cf\nwhether healthcare providers believe our drug candidates provide clinical utility; and\n\u25cf\nwhether private health insurers, government health programs and other third-party payers will cover our drug candidates.\nWe currently have no commercial organization. If we are unable to establish satisfactory sales and marketing capabilities or secure a sales and marketing partner, we may not successfully commercialize any of our product candidates.\nWe have no commercial infrastructure. In order to commercialize products that are approved for marketing, we must either establish our own sales and marketing infrastructure or collaborate with third parties that have such commercial infrastructure.\nWe may not be able to enter into collaboration agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, even if we enter into such relationships, we may have limited or no control over the sales, marketing and distribution activities of these third parties. Our future revenues may depend heavily on the success of the efforts of these third parties. If we elect to establish a sales and marketing infrastructure, we may not realize a positive return on this investment. In addition, we will have to compete with established and well-funded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train and retain sales and marketing personnel. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our drug candidates without strategic partners or licensees include:\n\u25cf\nour inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u25cf\nthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe our future products;\n\u25cf\nthe lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u25cf\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nIf we are not successful in recruiting sales and marketing personnel or in building a sales and marketing infrastructure, or if we do not successfully enter into appropriate collaboration arrangements, we will have difficulty successfully commercializing our drug candidates and any we may develop or acquire, which would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Outside the United States, we may commercialize our drug candidates by entering into collaboration agreements with pharmaceutical partners. We may not be able to enter into such agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, even if we enter into such relationships, we may have limited or no control over the sales, marketing and distribution activities of these third parties. Our future revenues may depend heavily on the success of the efforts of these third parties.\nBecause we license some of our product candidates from third parties, including First Wave, any dispute with our licensors or non-performance by us or by our licensors may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidates.\nSome of our drug candidates, including MS1819 and niclosamide, including related intellectual property rights, were licensed from third parties. Under the terms of our license agreements, the licensors generally have the right to terminate such agreements in the event of a material breach by us. Our licenses require us to make annual, milestone or other payments prior to commercialization of any product and royalties on net sales following commercialization and our ability to make these payments depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. These agreements generally require us to use diligent and reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the product candidate.\nIf there is any conflict, dispute, disagreement or issue of non-performance between us and our licensing partner regarding our rights or obligations under the license or other agreements, including any conflict, dispute or disagreement arising from our failure to satisfy payment obligations under such agreement, our ability to develop and commercialize the affected product candidate may be adversely affected. Any loss of our rights under our license agreements could delay or completely terminate our product development efforts for the affected product candidate.\nWe may form or seek strategic alliances or enter into additional licensing arrangements in the future, and we may not realize the benefits of such alliances or licensing arrangements.\nFrom time to time, we may form or seek strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations or enter into additional licensing arrangements with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our development and commercialization efforts with respect to MS1819, niclosamide and our other drug candidates and any future drug candidates that we may develop. Any of these relationships may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders or disrupt our management and business. These relationships also may result in a delay in the development of MS1819, niclosamide and our other drug candidates if we become dependent upon the other party and such other party does not prioritize the development of our drug candidates relative to its other development activities. In addition, we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for our drug candidates because they may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort and third parties may not view our drug candidates as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy. If we license products or businesses, we may not be able to realize the benefit of such transactions if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture. We cannot be certain that, following a strategic transaction or license, we will achieve the revenue or specific net income that justifies such transaction. We rely completely on third parties to manufacture our preclinical and clinical pharmaceutical supplies and expect to continue to rely on third parties to produce commercial supplies of our drug candidates, and our dependence on third party suppliers could adversely impact our business.\nWe rely completely on third parties to manufacture our preclinical and clinical pharmaceutical supplies and expect to continue to rely on third parties to produce commercial supplies of any approved product candidate, and our dependence on third party suppliers could adversely impact our business.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture our drug candidates, including MS1819 and niclosamide. The proprietary yeast cell line from which the MS1819 API is derived is kept at a storage facility maintained by Charles River. MS1819 drug substance is currently manufactured at a contract facility located in Capua, Italy owned by Olon SpA, and MS1819 drug product is currently manufactured at contract facilities located in Reims, France and Craigavon, United Kingdom owned by Delpharm and Almac Pharma Services, respectively. Niclosamide API is obtained by chemical synthesis and is currently manufactured by Olon SpA at a facility in Murcia, Spain. The drug substance manufacturing for niclosamide is currently conducted at a contract facility located in Milan, Italy owned by Monteresearch. We believe there are multiple alternative contract manufacturers capable of producing the MS1819 product we need for clinical trials. We are in the process of establishing alternative manufacturers and manufacturing sites for the product; however, there is no guarantee that the processes are easily reproducible and transferrable. In December 2020, we entered into a master service agreement with Asymchem to initiate the transfer of the manufacturing process for both drug substance and drug product.\nWe are completely dependent on these third parties for product supply and our MS1819 and niclosamide development programs would be adversely affected by a significant interruption in our ability to receive such materials. We have not yet entered into long-term manufacturing or supply agreements with any third parties. Furthermore, our third-party suppliers will be required to maintain compliance with cGMPs and will be subject to inspections by the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance. In the event that the FDA or such other authorities determine that our third-party suppliers have not complied with cGMP, our clinical trials could be terminated or subjected to a clinical hold until such time as we are able to obtain appropriate replacement material. Any delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture, packaging, or storage of our products as a result of a failure of the facilities or operations of our third-party suppliers to pass any regulatory agency inspection could significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize our products.\nWe do not expect to have the resources or capacity to commercially manufacture any of our proposed products, if approved, and will likely continue to be dependent upon third party manufacturers. Our dependence on third parties to manufacture and supply us with clinical trial materials and any approved products may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our products on a timely basis or at all.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not meet our deadlines or otherwise conduct the trials as required, our clinical development programs could be delayed or unsuccessful and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates when expected or at all.\nWe do not have the ability to conduct all aspects of our preclinical testing or clinical trials ourselves. We use contract research organizations (CROs) to conduct our planned clinical trials and will rely upon such CROs, as well as medical institutions, clinical investigators and consultants, to conduct our trials in accordance with our clinical protocols. Our CROs, investigators and other third parties will play a significant role in the conduct of these trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data from the clinical trials.\nThere is no guarantee that any CROs, investigators and other third parties upon which we rely for administration and conduct of our clinical trials will devote adequate time and resources to such trials or perform as contractually required. If any of these third parties fail to meet expected deadlines, fail to adhere to our clinical protocols or otherwise perform in a substandard manner, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated. If any of our clinical trial sites terminate for any reason, we may experience the loss of follow-up information on patients enrolled in our ongoing clinical trials unless we are able to transfer the care of those patients to another qualified clinical trial site. In addition, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and receive cash or equity compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be jeopardized.\nWe will face intense competition and may not be able to compete successfully.\nWe operate in highly competitive segments of the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical markets. We face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions. MS1819, niclosamide and our other drug candidates, if successfully developed and approved, will compete with established therapies, as well as new treatments that may be introduced by our competitors. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, product development, manufacturing and marketing resources than us. Large pharmaceutical companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for drugs. We also may compete with these organizations to recruit management, scientists and clinical development personnel. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. New developments, including the development of other biological and pharmaceutical technologies and methods of treating disease, occur in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries at a rapid pace. Developments by competitors may render our drug candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. We will also face competition from these third parties in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials and in identifying and in-licensing new drug candidates. In the case of niclosamide, we may also face competition from other companies developing different formulation of niclosamide for the same indications for which we intend to develop niclosamide, or from off-label uses of niclosamide approved for other indications.\nOur success will depend upon intellectual property, proprietary technologies and regulatory market exclusivity periods, and we may be unable to protect our intellectual property.\nOur success will depend, in large part, on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection for MS1819, niclosamide and our other drug candidates and their formulations and uses, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. If we or our licensors fail to appropriately prosecute and maintain patent protection for our drug candidates, our ability to develop and commercialize these drug candidates may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products. This failure to properly protect the intellectual property rights relating to these drug candidates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe patent application process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we or our partners will be successful in protecting our drug candidates by obtaining and defending patents. These risks and uncertainties include the following:\n\u25cf\npatent applications may not result in any patents being issued;\n\u25cf\npatents that may be issued or in-licensed may be challenged, invalidated, modified, revoked, circumvented, found to be unenforceable, or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage;\n\u25cf\nour competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than we or our partners and many of which have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek, or may already have obtained, patents that will limit, interfere with, or eliminate our ability to make, use, and sell our potential products;\n\u25cf\nthere may be significant pressure on the United States government and other international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States for disease treatments that prove successful as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns;\n\u25cf\ncountries other than the United States may have patent laws less favorable to patentees than those upheld by United States courts, allowing foreign competitors a better opportunity to create, develop, and market competing products; and\n\u25cf\nwe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nIn addition to patents, we and our partners also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how. Although we have taken steps to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how, including entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and confidential information and inventions agreements with employees, consultants and advisors, third parties may still obtain this information or come upon this same or similar information independently. We may become subject to claims that we or consultants, advisors or independent contractors that we may engage to assist us in developing MS1819, niclosamide, and our other drug candidates have wrongfully or inadvertently disclosed to us or used trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers or their other clients.\nWe intend to rely on market exclusivity periods that may not be or remain available to us.\nWe intend to rely on our ability to obtain and maintain a regulatory period of market exclusivity for any of our biologic drug candidates, including MS1819 and niclosamide that are successfully developed and approved for commercialization. Although this period in the United States is currently 12 years from the date of marketing approval, reductions to this period have been proposed. This exclusivity period in Europe is currently 10 years from the date of marketing approval by the EMA. Once any regulatory period of exclusivity expires, depending on the status of our patent coverage and the nature of the product, we may not be able to prevent others from marketing products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with our products, which would materially adversely affect us.\nBecause niclosamide is a small molecule it would be subject either to three or five year exclusivity, depending on the regulatory pathway of any clinical trials. niclosamide is not entitled to the same 12-year exclusivity as our biologic drug candidates.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or fail to enter into agreements with third parties to market, distribute and sell any products we may successfully develop, we may not be able to effectively market and sell any such products and generate product revenue.\nWe do not currently have the infrastructure for the sales, marketing and distribution of any of our drug candidates, and must build this infrastructure or arrange for third parties to perform these functions in order to commercialize any products that we may successfully develop. The establishment and development of a sales force, either by us or jointly with a partner, or the establishment of a contract sales force to market any products we may develop will be expensive and time-consuming and could delay any product launch. If we, or our partners, are unable to establish sales and marketing capability or any other non-technical capabilities necessary to commercialize any products we may successfully develop, we will need to contract with third parties to market and sell such products. We may not be able to establish arrangements with third-parties on acceptable terms, if at all.\nIf any product candidate that we successfully develop does not achieve broad market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community, the revenues that it generates from their sales will be limited.\nEven if MS1819, niclosamide and our other drug candidates receive regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community. Coverage and reimbursement of our drug candidates by third-party payors, including government payors, generally is also necessary for commercial success. The degree of market acceptance of any approved products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe efficacy and safety as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nthe clinical indications for which the product is approved;\n\u25cf\nacceptance by physicians, major operators of hospitals and clinics and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u25cf\nacceptance of the product by the target population;\n\u25cf\nthe potential and perceived advantages of drug candidates over alternative treatments;\n\u25cf\nthe safety of drug candidates seen in a broader patient group, including its use outside the approved indications;\n\u25cf\nthe cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u25cf\nthe availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing by third parties and government authorities;\n\u25cf\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u25cf\nthe prevalence and severity of adverse events;\n\u25cf\nthe effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts; and\n\u25cf\nunfavorable publicity relating to the product.\nIf any product candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, hospitals, healthcare payors and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue from these products and may not become or remain profitable.\nThe First Wave License Agreement requires us to make significant developmental milestone and other payments which will require additional financing and, in the event we do commercialize niclosamide, we will be required to make royalty payments on net sales of the product which will decrease the revenues we may ultimately receive on sales. To the extent that such milestone, royalty and other payments are not timely made, First Wave, in certain cases, may terminate the First Wave License Agreement.\nUnder the First Wave License Agreement, we must pay to First Wave significant milestone payments, and royalties on net sales (as defined in the First Wave Agreement). In order to make the various milestone payments that are required, we will need to raise additional funds. In addition, our royalty obligations will reduce the economic benefits to us of any future sales of niclosamide if we do receive regulatory approval and seek to commercialize niclosamide. To the extent that such milestone payments and royalties are not timely made, under the First Wave License Agreement, First Wave has certain termination rights relating to our license of niclosamide.\nWe may incur substantial product liability or indemnification claims relating to the use of our product candidates.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure based on the use of MS1819, niclosamide and our other drug candidates in human clinical trials, or, if obtained, following marketing approval and commercialization. Claims could be brought against us if use or misuse of one of our drug candidates causes, or merely appears to have caused, personal injury or death. Although we have and intend to maintain product liability insurance relating to our clinical trials, our coverage may not be sufficient to cover claims that may be made against us and we may be unable to maintain such insurance. Any claims against us, regardless of their merit, could severely harm our financial condition, strain our management and other resources or destroy the prospects for commercialization of the product which is the subject of any such claim. We are unable to predict if we will be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance for any products that may be approved for marketing. Additionally, we have entered into various agreements where we indemnify third parties for certain claims relating to the testing and use of our drug candidates. These indemnification obligations may require us to pay significant sums of money for claims that are covered by these indemnifications.\nWe cannot predict all of the possible harms or side effects that may result from the use of our products and, therefore, the amount of insurance coverage we currently hold, or that we or our collaborators may obtain, may not be adequate to protect us from any claims arising from the use of our products that are beyond the limit of our insurance coverage. If we cannot protect against potential liability claims, we or our collaborators may find it difficult or impossible to commercialize our products, and we may not be able to renew or increase our insurance coverage on reasonable terms, if at all. The marketing, sale and use of our products and our planned future products could lead to the filing of product liability claims against us if someone alleges that our products failed to perform as designed. A product liability or professional liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time-consuming for us to defend.\nAny product liability or professional liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage. Additionally, any product liability lawsuit could damage our reputation, result in the recall of products, or cause current partners to terminate existing agreements and potential partners to seek other partners, any of which could impact our results of operations.\nIf we use biological and hazardous materials in a manner that causes injury, we could be liable for damages.\nOur activities may require the controlled use of potentially harmful biological materials, hazardous materials and chemicals and may in the future require the use of radioactive compounds. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to employees or third parties from the use, storage, handling or disposal of these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources or any applicable insurance coverage we may have. Additionally, we are subject on an ongoing basis to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations might be significant and could negatively affect our operating results. In the event of an accident or if we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could lose our permits or approvals or be held liable for damages or penalized with fines.\nWe have benefited from certain non-reimbursable subsidies from the French government that if terminated or reduced may restrict our ability to successfully develop, manufacture and commercialize our drug candidates.\nWe have benefited from certain tax advantages, including, for example, the research tax credit (Cr\u00e9dit d'Imp\u00f4t Recherche, the \u201cCIR\u201d). The CIR is a French tax credit aimed at stimulating research and development. The CIR can be offset against French corporate income tax due and the portion in excess (if any) may be refunded at the end of a three fiscal-year period (or, sooner, for smaller companies such as ours). The CIR is calculated based on our claimed amount of eligible research and development expenditures in France. The French tax authority with the assistance of the Research and Technology Ministry may audit each research and development program in respect of which a CIR benefit has been claimed and assess whether such program qualifies in its view for the CIR benefit. The French tax authorities may challenge our eligibility to, or our calculation of certain tax reductions and/or deductions in respect of our research and development activities and, should the French tax authorities be successful, we may be liable for additional corporate income tax, and penalties and interest related thereto, or we may not obtain the refunds for which we have applied, which could have a significant impact on our results of operations and future cash flows. We believe we are eligible to receive the CIR benefit through at least the end of 2021. If our research and development operations in France are terminated, we would no longer be eligible to receive the CIR. Furthermore, if the French Parliament decides to eliminate, or reduce the scope or the rate of, the CIR benefit, either of which it could decide to do at any time, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nDue to the significant resources required for the development of our drug candidates, we must prioritize development of certain drug candidates and/or certain disease indications. We may expend our limited resources on candidates or indications that do not yield a successful product and fail to capitalize on drug candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nWe plan to develop a pipeline of drug candidates to treat GI and other diseases. Due to the significant resources required for the development of drug candidates, we must focus our attention and resources on specific diseases and/or indications and decide which drug candidates to pursue and the amount of resources to allocate to each. We are currently focusing our resources on the development of our lead product candidate, MS1819, for the treatment of EPI associated with CF and CP.\nWe have also recently entered into the First Wave License Agreement with First Wave pursuant to which we were granted a worldwide, exclusive right to develop, manufacture, and commercialize First Wave\u2019s proprietary immediate release and enema formulations of niclosamide for the fields of treating ICI-AC and COVID-19 gastrointestinal infections in humans. We are now solely responsible, and have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts, for all development, regulatory and commercial activities related to the Products in the ICI-AC and COVID-19 fields.\nOur decisions concerning the allocation of research, development, collaboration, management and financial resources toward particular drug candidates or therapeutic areas may not lead to the development of any viable commercial product and may divert resources away from better opportunities. Similarly, any decision to delay, terminate or collaborate with third parties in respect of certain programs or drug candidates may subsequently prove to be suboptimal and could cause us to miss valuable opportunities. If we make incorrect determinations regarding the viability or market potential of any of our programs or drug candidates or misread trends in the GI, CF, CP, COVID-19 or biotechnology industry, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. As a result, we may fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities, be required to forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other drug candidates or other diseases and indications that may later prove to have greater commercial potential than those we choose to pursue, or relinquish valuable rights to such drug candidates through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been advantageous for us to invest additional resources to retain development and commercialization rights.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key management and clinical development personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe are dependent on our management team and clinical development personnel and our success will depend on their continued service, as well as our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. In particular, the continued development of our senior management team which now includes James Sapirstein, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel Schneiderman, our Chief Financial Officer, and James Pennington, our Chief Medical Officer, is critical to our success. The market for the services of qualified personnel in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive. The loss of service of any member of our senior management team or key personnel could prevent, impair or delay the implementation of our business plan, the successful conduct and completion of our planned clinical trials and the commercialization of any drug candidates that we may successfully develop. We do not carry key man insurance for any member of our senior management team.\nWe use biological materials and may use hazardous materials, and any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming or costly.\nWe may use hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological agents and compounds, that could be dangerous to human health and safety or the environment. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and wastes. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our product development efforts. In addition, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials or wastes. We do not carry specific biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage and our property and casualty, and general liability insurance policies specifically exclude coverage for damages and fines arising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination. Accordingly, in the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources, and our clinical trials or regulatory approvals could be suspended.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses, we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological or hazardous materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nIf we or our partners are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success also depends upon our ability and the ability of any of our future collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our drug candidates without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous United States and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing products, some of which may be directed at claims that overlap with the subject matter of our intellectual property. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that our drug candidates or proprietary technologies may infringe. Similarly, there may be issued patents relevant to our drug candidates of which we are not aware.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries generally. If a third-party claims that we or any of our licensors, suppliers or collaborators infringe the third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we may have to:\n\u25cf\nobtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u25cf\nabandon an infringing product candidate or redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement;\n\u25cf\npay substantial damages, including the possibility of treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if a court decides that the product or proprietary technology at issue infringes on or violates the third party\u2019s rights;\n\u25cf\npay substantial royalties, fees and/or grant cross licenses to our technology; and/or\n\u25cf\ndefend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources.\nHealthcare reform and restrictions on reimbursements may limit our financial returns.\nOur ability or the ability of our collaborators to commercialize any of our drug candidates that we successfully develop may depend, in part, on the extent to which government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations will reimburse consumers for the cost of these products. These third parties are increasingly challenging both the need for and the price of new drug products. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available for our drug candidates to enable us or our collaborators to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on their and our investments in research and product development.\nChanges in healthcare law and implementing regulations, including government restrictions on pricing and reimbursement, as well as healthcare policy and other healthcare payor cost-containment initiatives, may negatively impact our ability to generate revenues.\nThe potential pricing and reimbursement environment for MS1819, niclosamide and our other drug candidates and any future products may change in the future and become more challenging due to, among other reasons, policies advanced by the current or any new presidential administration, federal agencies, healthcare legislation passed by Congress, or fiscal challenges faced by all levels of government health administration authorities.\nIf we or any of our independent contractors, consultants, collaborators, manufacturers, vendors or service providers fail to comply with healthcare laws and regulations, we or they could be subject to enforcement actions, which could result in penalties and affect our ability to develop, market and sell our product candidates and may harm our reputation.\nWe are subject to federal, state, and foreign healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights. These laws and regulations include:\n\u25cf\nthe U.S. federal healthcare program anti-kickback law, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual for a healthcare item or service, or the purchasing or ordering of an item or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid;\n\u25cf\nthe U.S. federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented, claims for payment by government funded programs such as Medicare or Medicaid that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to us by virtue of statements and representations made to customers or third parties;\n\u25cf\nthe U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\u201cHIPAA \u201d), which prohibits, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud healthcare programs;\n\u25cf\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and requires notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information;\n\u25cf\nthe federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members, which is published in a searchable form on an annual basis; and\n\u25cf\nstate laws comparable to each of the above federal laws, such as, for example, anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope and also apply to commercial insurers and other non-federal payors, requirements for mandatory corporate regulatory compliance programs, and laws relating to patient data privacy and security.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any such health care laws and regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, monetary damages, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA, or exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, any of which could adversely affect our financial results. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for an alleged or suspected violation could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and could divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business, even if our defense is successful. In addition, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations may be costly to us in terms of money, time and resources.\nWe will need to grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had ten employees. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, we expect to need additional managerial, operational, research and development, sales, marketing, financial and other personnel. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including:\n\u25cf\nidentifying, recruiting, integrating, maintaining and motivating additional employees;\n\u25cf\nmanaging our internal development efforts effectively, including the clinical, FDA and international regulatory review process for our drug candidates, while complying with our contractual obligations to contractors and other third parties; and\n\u25cf\nimproving our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.\nOur future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our drug candidates will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth, and our management may also have to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from day-to-day activities in order to devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities.\nWe currently rely, and for the foreseeable future will continue to rely, in substantial part on certain independent organizations, advisors and consultants to provide certain services, including certain aspects of regulatory approval, clinical management and manufacturing. There can be no assurance that the services of independent organizations, advisors and consultants will continue to be available to us on a timely basis when needed, or that we can find qualified replacements. In addition, if we are unable to effectively manage our outsourced activities or if the quality or accuracy of the services provided by consultants is compromised for any reason, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of our drug candidates or otherwise advance our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our existing consultants and contractors or find other competent outside contractors and consultants on economically reasonable terms, or at all.\nIf we are not able to effectively expand our organization by hiring new employees and expanding our groups of consultants and contractors, we may not be able to successfully implement the tasks necessary to further develop and commercialize our drug candidates and, accordingly, may not achieve our research, development and commercialization goals.\nWe are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws with respect to our operations and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal and/or civil liability and harm our business.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and possibly other state and national anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, third-party intermediaries, joint venture partners and collaborators from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector. We engage third-party investigators, CROs, and other consultants to design and perform preclinical studies of our drug candidates and will do the same for any clinical trials. Also, once a drug candidate has been approved and commercialized, we may engage third-party intermediaries to promote and sell our products abroad and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, and other regulatory approvals. We or our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, collaborators, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities.\nNoncompliance with anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension and/or debarment from contracting with certain persons, the loss of export privileges, reputational harm, adverse media coverage, and other collateral consequences. If any subpoenas, investigations, or other enforcement actions are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management's attention and resources and significant defense and compliance costs and other professional fees. In certain cases, enforcement authorities may even cause us to appoint an independent compliance monitor which can result in added costs and administrative burdens.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of data security could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe collect and maintain information in digital form that is necessary to conduct our business, and we are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information. It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We have established physical, electronic and organizational measures to safeguard and secure our systems to prevent a data compromise, and rely on commercially available systems, software, tools, and monitoring to provide security for our information technology systems and the processing, transmission and storage of digital information. We have also outsourced elements of our information technology infrastructure, and as a result a number of third-party vendors may or could have access to our confidential information. Our internal information technology systems and infrastructure, and those of our current and any future collaborators, contractors and consultants and other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, malware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization.\nThe risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber-terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. In addition, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information or other intellectual property. The costs to us to mitigate network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and while we have implemented security measures to protect our data security and information technology systems, our efforts to address these problems may not be successful, and these problems could result in unexpected interruptions, delays, cessation of service and other harm to our business and our competitive position. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our product development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Moreover, if a computer security breach affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information, our reputation could be materially damaged.\nIn addition, such a breach may require notification to governmental agencies, the media or individuals pursuant to various federal and state privacy and security laws, if applicable, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Clinical Health Act of 2009, and its implementing rules and regulations, as well as regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission and state breach notification laws.\nUnder the EU regulation and notably the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, No. 2016/679, which entered into force on May 25, 2018 and is applicable personal data that we process in relation to our presence in the EU, the offering of products or services to individuals in the EU or the monitoring of the behavior of individuals in the EU, we have also a legal responsibility to report personal data breaches to the competent supervisory authority. The EU data protection regulation includes a broad definition and a short deadline for the notification of personal data breaches, which may be difficult to implement in practice and requires that we implement robust internal processes. Under this regulation, we have to report personal data breaches to the competent supervisory authority within 72 hours of the time we become aware of a breach \"unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the right and freedoms of natural persons\" (Article 33 of the GDPR). In addition, the GDPR requires that we communicate the breach to the Data Subject if the breach is \"likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons\" (Article 34 of the GDPR). In order to fulfil these requirements, we have to implement specific internal processes to be followed in case of a personal data breach, which will allow us to (a) contain and recover the breach, (b) assess the risk to the data subjects, (c) notify, and possibly communicate the breach to the data subjects, (d) investigate and respond to the breach. The performance of these processes implies substantial costs in resources and time.\nMoreover, as we may rely on third parties that will also process as processor the data for which we are a data controller-for example, in the context of the manufacturing of our drug candidates or for the conduct of clinical trials, we must contractually ensure that strict security measures, as well as appropriate obligations including an obligation to report in due delay any security incident are implemented, in order to allow us fulfilling our own regulatory requirements.\nWe would also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and potential liability for any security breach on personal data for which we are data controller. The costs of above-mentioned processes together with legal penalties, possible compensation for damages and any resulting lawsuits arising from a breach may be extensive and may have a negative impact on reputation and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur employees and independent contractors, including principal investigators, consultants, commercial collaborators, service providers and other vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees and independent contractors, including principal investigators, consultants, any future commercial collaborators, service providers and other vendors may engage in misconduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or other unauthorized activities that violate the laws and regulations of the FDA, EMA and other similar regulatory bodies, including those laws that require the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such regulatory bodies; manufacturing standards; healthcare fraud and abuse, data privacy laws and other similar laws; or laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use or misrepresentation of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, the creation of fraudulent data in our preclinical studies or clinical trials, or illegal misappropriation of product, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. In addition, we are subject to the risk that a person or government could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and financial results, including, without limitation, the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgements, possible exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, individual imprisonment, other sanctions, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nOur ability to compete may decline if we do not adequately protect our proprietary rights.\nOur success depends on obtaining and maintaining proprietary rights to our drug candidates for the treatment of age-related diseases, as well as successfully defending these rights against third-party challenges. We will only be able to protect our drug candidates, and their uses from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable patents, or effectively protected trade secrets, cover them. Our ability to obtain patent protection for our drug candidates is uncertain due to a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nwe may not have been the first to make the inventions covered by pending patent applications or issued patent\n\u25cf\nwe may not have been the first to file patent applications for our drug candidates or the compositions we developed or for their uses;\n\u25cf\nothers may independently develop identical, similar or alternative products or compositions and uses thereof;\n\u25cf\nour disclosures in patent applications may not be sufficient to meet the statutory requirements for patentability;\n\u25cf\nany or all of our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents;\n\u25cf\nwe may not seek or obtain patent protection in countries that may eventually provide us a significant business opportunity;\n\u25cf\nany patents issued to us may not provide a basis for commercially viable products, may not provide any competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties;\n\u25cf\nour compositions and methods may not be patentable;\n\u25cf\nhers may design around our patent claims to produce competitive products which fall outside of the scope of our patents;\n\u25cf\nothers may identify prior art or other bases which could invalidate our patents.\nEven if we have or obtain patents covering our drug candidates or compositions, we may still be barred from making, using and selling our drug candidates or technologies because of the patent rights of others. Others may have filed, and in the future may file, patent applications covering compositions or products that are similar or identical to ours. There are many issued U.S. and foreign patents relating to chemical compounds and therapeutic products, and some of these relate to compounds we intend to commercialize. These could materially affect our ability to develop our drug candidates or sell our products if approved. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications unknown to us that may later result in issued patents that our drug candidates or compositions may infringe. These patent applications may have priority over patent applications filed by us.\nObtaining and maintaining a patent portfolio entails significant expense and resources. Part of the expense includes periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees, various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications due in several stages over the lifetime of patents and/or applications, as well as the cost associated with complying with numerous procedural provisions during the patent application process. We may or may not choose to pursue or maintain protection for particular inventions. In addition, there are situations in which failure to make certain payments or noncompliance with certain requirements in the patent process can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If we choose to forgo patent protection or allow a patent application or patent to lapse purposefully or inadvertently, our competitive position could suffer.\nIn addition, it is unclear at this time what Brexit's impact will have on our intellectual property rights and the process for obtaining and defending such rights. It is possible that certain intellectual property rights, such as trademarks, granted by the EU will cease being enforceable in the UK absent special arrangements to the contrary. With regard to existing patent rights, the effect of Brexit should be minimal considering enforceable patent rights are specific to the UK, whether arising out of the European Patent Office or directly through the UK patent office.\nLegal actions to enforce our proprietary rights (including patents and trademarks) can be expensive and may involve the diversion of significant management time. In addition, these legal actions could be unsuccessful and could also result in the invalidation of our patents or trademarks or a finding that they are unenforceable. We may or may not choose to pursue litigation or other actions against those that have infringed on our patents or trademarks, or used them without authorization, due to the associated expense and time commitment of monitoring these activities. If we fail to protect or to enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our results of operations.\nRisks Relating to our Finances, Capital Requirements and Other Financial Matters\nWe are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with a history of operating losses that are expected to continue and we are unable to predict the extent of future losses, whether we will generate significant revenues or whether we will achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe are a company in the clinical stage of pharmaceutical development and our prospects must be considered in light of the uncertainties, risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of operations. We have generated operating losses since our inception, including losses of approximately $32.7 million and $15.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect to make substantial expenditures and incur increasing operating costs in the future and our accumulated deficit will increase significantly as we expand development and clinical trial activities for MS1819, niclosamide and our other drug candidates. Our losses have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our working capital, total assets and stockholders\u2019 equity. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses, whether we will ever generate significant revenues or if we will ever achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $95.4 million and negative working of approximately $7.7 million. Based on our historical and anticipated rate of cash expenditures, we do not anticipate our working capital will be sufficient to sustain our business through the successful commercialization of our drug candidates. Therefore, we are dependent on obtaining, and are continuing to pursue, the necessary funding from outside sources, including obtaining additional funding from the sale of securities, in order to continue our operations. Without adequate funding, we may not be able to meet our obligations. We believe these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nRaising additional funds by issuing securities or through licensing or lending arrangements may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, the share ownership of existing stockholders will be diluted. Any future debt financing may involve covenants that restrict our operations, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, redeem our stock, make certain investments and engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions, among other restrictions. In addition, if we raise additional funds through licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our drug candidates or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nIn the event we effect any issuance, or any of our subsidiaries, of Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents for cash consideration, or a combination of units thereof (a \u201cSubsequent Financing\u201d), each holder of our Series B Preferred Stock has the right, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Series B Certificate of Designations, at its option, to exchange (in lieu of cash subscription payments) all or some of the Series B Preferred Stock then held (with a value per share of Series B Preferred Stock equal to the Liquidation Preference) for any securities or units issued in a Subsequent Financing on dollar-for-dollar basis.\nWe will need substantial additional capital and certain terms included in our financing transactions may prohibit us from raising capital when needed, which would force us to delay, curtail or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs or commercialization efforts.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred research and development expense of approximately $19.1 million and $8.7 million, respectively. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts on product development, including conducting clinical trials for MS1819, niclosamide and our other drug candidates and manufacturing and purchasing clinical trial materials from our suppliers. We will require substantial additional funds to support our continued research and development activities, as well as the anticipated costs of preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory approvals and potential commercialization. We could spend our available financial resources much faster than we currently expect.\nFurther, pursuant to the financing transaction documents we entered into in connection with the March 2021 Offering, we have agreed, not to issue, enter into any agreement to issue or announce the issuance or proposed issuance of any shares of common stock or common stock equivalents or file any registration statement until April 29, 2021. In addition, we have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, for the one-year period commencing on the signing of the March 2021 Purchase Agreement, not to (i) issue or sell any debt or equity securities that are convertible into, exchangeable or exercisable for, or include the right to receive, additional common stock either (A) at a conversion price, exercise price or exchange rate or other price that is based upon, and/or varies with, the trading prices of or quotations for the common stock at any time after the initial issuance of such debt or equity securities or (B) with a conversion, exercise or exchange price that is subject to being reset at some future date after the initial issuance of such debt or equity security or upon the occurrence of specified or contingent events directly or indirectly related to our business or the market for the common stock or (ii) enter into, or effect a transaction under, any agreement, including, but not limited to, an equity line of credit, whereby we may issue securities at a future determined price. The March 2021 Purchase Agreement limits our ability to make sales of our Common Stock pursuant to our Equity Line Agreement (as defined below) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC until July 7, 2021.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue and achieve profitability, we expect to seek to finance future cash needs through equity and/or debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements. We currently have no other commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions and we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we will have to delay, curtail or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs. If we are able to raise additional capital, our stockholders may experience additional dilution, and as a result, our stock price may decline.\nIf we issue additional shares of Common Stock in the future, including issuances of shares upon conversion or exercise of our outstanding securities convertible and/or exercisable into shares of Common Stock, our existing stockholders will be diluted.\nThe conversion or exercise, as applicable, of outstanding securities will dilute the voting interest of the owners of presently outstanding shares of Common Stock by adding a substantial number of additional shares of our Common Stock. As of March 29, 2021, we had:\n\u25cf\n3,932,506 shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options, at a weighted average exercise price of $1.20 per share under our 2014 Plan;\n\u25cf\n387,000 shares of granted, but unissued restricted stock and restricted stock units under our 2014 Plan;\n\u25cf\n353,685 shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options, at a weighted average exercise price of $1.01 per share under our 2020 Plan;\n\u25cf\n9,646,315 shares of Common Stock that are available for future issuance under our 2020 Plan;\n\u25cf\n44,930,105 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants, with a weighted average exercise price of $1.02 per share;\n\u25cf\n12,553,791 shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of Series B Preferred Stock, including accrued and unpaid dividends thereon in the aggregate amount of approximately $207,000;\n\u25cf\nup to 347,461 shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of Series C Preferred Stock that may be issued pursuant to the Exchange Right, in excess of amounts currently underlying the Series B Preferred Stock;\n\u25cf\nup to 13,376,159 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Investor Warrants that may be issued pursuant to the Exchange Right;\nTo the extent any of these convertible securities, warrants or options are converted or exercised and any additional options are granted and exercised, there will be further dilution to stockholders and investors.\nRisks Associated with our Capital Stock\nOur failure to maintain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements could result in the delisting of our Common Stock.\nOn March 23, 2020, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department (the \u201cStaff\u201d) of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) indicating that, based upon the closing bid price of our Common Stock for the prior 30 consecutive business days, we were not in compliance with the requirement to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share for continued listing on Nasdaq, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \u201cMinimum Bid Price Requirement\u201d). The 180-day time period for us to regain compliance was subsequently extended to December 3, 2020, pursuant to certain COVID-19 related relief from price-based continued listing requirements issued by Nasdaq on April 16, 2020. On November 23, 2020, we submitted a request to Nasdaq for a 180-day extension to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. On December 4, 2020, we received a letter from Nasdaq advising that we had been granted a 180-day extension to June 1, 2021 to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A). If we do not regain compliance within the allotted compliance periods, including any extensions that may be granted by Nasdaq, Nasdaq will provide notice that our Common Stock will be subject to delisting. We would then be entitled to appeal that determination to a Nasdaq hearings panel. We will continue to monitor the closing bid price of our Common Stock and seek to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement within the allotted compliance period. If we do not regain compliance within the allotted compliance period, Nasdaq will provide notice that our Common Stock will be subject to delisting. We would then be entitled to appeal that determination to a Nasdaq hearings panel. There can be no assurance that we will regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement during the 180-day extension.\nOn February 12, 2021, we received a letter from Nasdaq indicating that the Staff had determined that, from January 21 to February 12, 2021, the closing bid price of the Common Stock had been at $1.00 per share or greater. Accordingly, the Staff determined that we had regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and that the matter is now closed.\nThe limited public market for our securities may adversely affect an investor\u2019s ability to liquidate an investment in us.\nAlthough our Common Stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, there is limited trading activity. We can give no assurance that an active market will develop, or if developed, that it will be sustained. If an investor acquires shares of our Common Stock, the investor may not be able to liquidate our shares should there be a need or desire to do so.\nThe market price of our Common Stock may be volatile and may fluctuate in a way that is disproportionate to our operating performance.\nOur stock price may experience substantial volatility as a result of a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nsales or potential sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock;\n\u25cf\ndelay or failure in initiating or completing pre-clinical or clinical trials or unsatisfactory results of these trials;\n\u25cf\nannouncements about us or about our competitors, including clinical trial results, regulatory approvals or new product introductions;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments concerning our licensors or product manufacturers;\n\u25cf\nlitigation and other developments relating to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf\nconditions in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries;\n\u25cf\ngovernmental regulation and legislation;\n\u25cf\nvariations in our anticipated or actual operating results;\n\u25cf\nchange in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our performance, or our failure to meet analysts\u2019 expectations; foreign currency values and fluctuations; and\n\u25cf\noverall economic conditions.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. The stock markets in general, and the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies in particular, have historically experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market and industry factors could reduce the market price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nWe have never paid and do not intend to pay cash dividends on our Common Stock. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on any of our capital stock and we currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. Our Series B Preferred Stock carries a cumulative dividend rate of 9.0% per year, which is cumulative and continues to accrue on a daily basis whether or not declared and whether or not we have assets legally available therefor. We may pay such dividends at our option either in cash or in kind in additional shares of preferred stock. We do not expect to pay any dividends in cash and have paid accrued dividends in kind in additional shares of preferred stock to date. In addition, the terms of existing and future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our Common Stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation, our restated by-laws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our Common Stock.\nProvisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, our restated by-laws and Delaware law may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or changes in our management, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests. These provisions include:\n\u25cf\nthe inability of stockholders to call special meetings; and\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years, has owned 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your Common Stock in an acquisition.\nWe are eligible to be treated as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, as defined in the JOBS Act, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our Common Stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including (i) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and (iii) exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our Common Stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of any June 30 before that time or if we have total annual gross revenue of $1.0 billion or more during any fiscal year before that time, after which, in each case, we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31 or, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during any three-year period before that time, we would cease to be an emerging growth company immediately.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our shares or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our shares is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our share price could decline.\nWe currently have Series B Preferred Stock outstanding. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board to create new series of preferred stock without further approval by our stockholders, which could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our Common Stock.\nOur Board has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. Our Board also has the authority to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval.\nWe currently have approximately 1,248.89 shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding with a stated value of $7,700 per share, which are currently convertible at the holder\u2019s option at any time, together with any accrued but unpaid dividends thereon, into shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of $0.77, subject to certain adjustments.\nOur Series B Preferred Stock gives its holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation and the right to receive dividend payments at 9.00% per annum before dividends are distributed to the holders of Common Stock, among other things. In addition, in the event we effect any issuance of Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents for cash consideration, or a combination of units thereof, the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock have the right, subject to certain exceptions, at their option, to exchange (in lieu of cash subscription payments) all or some of the Series B Preferred Stock then held (with a value per share of the Series B Preferred Stock equal to the Series B Stated Value plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon) for any securities or units issued in such issuance on a dollar-for-dollar basis. The holders of the Series B Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, also have customary consent rights with respect to certain corporate actions, including the issuance of an increased number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock, the establishment of any capital stock ranking senior to or on parity the Series B Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, the incurrence of indebtedness, and certain changes to our Charter or Bylaws including other actions.\nOur obligations to the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and hinder the accomplishment of our corporate goals.\nIn addition to the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, our Board could authorize the issuance of additional series of preferred stock with such rights preferential to the rights of our Common Stock, including the issuance of a series of preferred stock that has greater voting power than our Common Stock or that is convertible into our Common Stock, which could decrease the relative voting power of our Common Stock or result in dilution to our existing stockholders.\nAs a result of the \u201cmost favored nation\u201d in the Series B Certificate of Designations, we may be required to issue additional shares of Series C Preferred Stock and/or Investor Warrants which would be convertible for or exercisable into additional shares of Common Stock, to the investors who purchased shares of our Series B Preferred Stock and related warrants to purchase shares of our Common Stock in a private placement in July 2020.\nOn July 16, 2020, we consummated a private placement offering (the \u201cSeries B Private Placement\u201d) in which we issued an aggregate of approximately 2,912.58 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, at a price of $7,700.00 per share, initially convertible into an aggregate of 29,125,756 shares of Common Stock at $0.77 per share, together with warrants to purchase an aggregate of 14,562,826 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.85 per share. The Series B Preferred Stock carries a cumulative dividend at a rate of 9.0% per annum, payable at our option either in cash or in kind in additional shares of Series B Preferred Stock.\nUnder the Series B Certificate of Designations, in the event we effect any issuance of Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents for cash consideration, or a combination of units thereof (a \u201cSubsequent Financing\u201d), each holder of the Series B Preferred Stock has the right to exchange the stated value, plus accrued and unpaid dividends, of the Series B Preferred Stock for any securities issued in the Subsequent Financing, in lieu of any cash subscription payments therefor (the \u201cExchange Right\u201d). As a result, as of March 29, 2021, we may be required to issue up to 13,376.159 additional shares of Series C Preferred Stock that are currently convertible up to 13,376,159 underlying shares of Common Stock, together with Investor Warrants to purchase up to an additional 13,376,159 shares of Common Stock, to any holders of Series B Preferred Stock who elect to exercise their Exchange Right. We anticipate that we would convert any shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be issued pursuant to the Exchange Right into underlying shares of Common Stock immediately upon issuance.\nIf the holders of our Series B Preferred Stock exercise their Exchange Rights, it will result in certain dilution to our stockholders, and would afford our stockholders a smaller percentage interest in our voting power, liquidation value and aggregate book value. The sale or resale of the Common Stock issued upon conversion of the preferred stock could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline. In addition, the issuance of Common Stock upon the exercise of the Investor Warrants will result in similar dilution to our stockholders. This dilution, or the possibility that it may occur, may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and a price that we deem appropriate.", "PERMNO": 16377, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "AZRX"}
