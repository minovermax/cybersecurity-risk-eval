{"cik": "1704760", "company": "American Virtual Cloud Technologies, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-06-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully all of the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Current Report on Form 10-K, before making a decision to invest in our common stock. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nGeneral economic weakness may harm the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations are largely dependent upon the state of the economy. Global economic weakness and uncertainty may result in decreased sales, gross margin, earnings and/or growth rates from its U.S. based customers and from customers outside the U.S. In addition, material changes in trade agreements between the U.S. and other countries may, for example, negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to purchase product, and import or export product, increasing product pricing and negatively impacting availability of product. Adverse economic conditions may decrease the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 demand for its products and services or impair the ability of its customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result, the Company\u2019s sales could decrease, and reserves for its credit losses and write-offs of receivables may increase.\nThe Company\u2019s business could be adversely affected by the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, which has and is continuing to spread throughout China and other parts of the world, including the United States. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a \u201cPublic Health Emergency of International Concern.\u201d On January 31, 2020, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency for the United States to aid the U.S. healthcare community in responding to COVID-19, and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the COVID-19 outbreak as a \u201cpandemic.\u201d The COVID-19 outbreak has severely restricted the level of economic activity within the United States and around the world.\nIn response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the governments of many countries, states, cities and other geographic regions have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations. Temporary closures of businesses have been ordered and numerous other businesses have temporarily closed voluntarily. These actions may continue to expand in scope, type and impact. These measures, while intended to protect human life, are expected to have significant adverse impacts on domestic and foreign economies of uncertain severity and duration. It is likely that the current outbreak or continued spread of COVID-19 will cause an economic slowdown, which may result in a global recession. The effectiveness of economic stabilization efforts being taken to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak is currently uncertain.\nA public health pandemic, including COVID-19, poses the risk that the Company or its affiliates, employees, suppliers, customers and others may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including as a result of shutdowns, travel restrictions and other actions that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. Such actions may prevent the Company from accessing the facilities of its customers to deliver products and provide services. In addition, the Company\u2019s customers may choose to delay or abandon projects on which it provides products and/or services as a result of such actions. Further, the Company has experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions or delays in its supply chain as a result of such actions. The Company can give no assurance that its businesses will be classified as essential in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has impacted, and may continue to impact, the Company\u2019s facilities, as well as those of its third-party vendors and customers, including through the effects of facility closures, reductions in operating hours and other social distancing efforts. In addition, the Company has modified its business practices (including employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and the Company may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that the Company determines are in the best interests of its employees, customers, partners, and suppliers.\nThe Company\u2019s liquidity could be negatively impacted if these conditions continue for a significant period of time and we may be required to pursue additional sources of financing to obtain working capital, maintain appropriate inventory levels and meet our financial obligations. Our ability to obtain any required financing is not guaranteed and largely dependent upon evolving market conditions and other factors. Depending on the continued impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, further actions may be required to improve the Company\u2019s cash position and capital structure. The Company cannot assure you that it would be able to take any of these actions on terms that are favorable to the Company or at all, that these actions would be successful and permit the Company to meet its scheduled debt service obligations or satisfy its capital requirements, or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of its existing or future debt agreements, including the Company\u2019s Comerica Credit Agreement assumed by American Virtual as of April 7, 2020 (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d).\nThe Company may also experience impacts from market downturns and changes in demand for the Company\u2019s products and services related to pandemic fears and impacts on its workforce as a result of COVID-19. If the COVID-19 outbreak becomes more pronounced in the Company\u2019s markets, or if another significant natural disaster or pandemic were to occur in the future, the Company\u2019s operations in areas impacted by such events could experience further adverse financial impacts due to market changes and other resulting events and circumstances. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak impacts the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, the longevity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Although it is difficult to predict the effect and ultimate impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Company\u2019s business, it is likely that the impact of COVID-19 will adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows in fiscal year 2020.\nEven after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, the Company may continue to experience significant impacts to its business as a result of the global economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, including any economic downturn or recession or other long-term effects that have occurred or may occur in the future.\nIf the Company loses one or more of its large volume customers, its earnings may be materially affected.\nMany of the contracts for the provision of products and services from the Company to its customers are generally non-exclusive agreements without volume purchase commitments and are terminable by either party upon 30 days\u2019 notice. The loss of one or more of its largest customers, the failure of such customers to pay amounts due to it, or a material reduction in the amount of purchases made by such customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in the IT industry, customers\u2019 usage or procurement of IT, and/or rapid changes in product standards may result in reduced demand for the IT hardware and software solutions and services the Company sells.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations are influenced by a variety of factors, including the condition of the IT industry, shifts in demand for, or availability of, IT hardware, software, peripherals and services, and industry introductions of new products, upgrades, methods of distribution, and the nature of how IT is consumed and procured. The IT industry is characterized by rapid technological change and the frequent introduction of new products, product enhancements and new distribution methods or channels, each of which can decrease demand for current products or render them obsolete. In addition, the proliferation of cloud technology, infrastructure as a service (IaaS), software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), software defined networking, or other emerging technologies may reduce the demand for products and services the Company sells to its customers. Cloud offerings may influence the Company\u2019s customers to move workloads to cloud providers, which may reduce the procurement of products and services from the Company. Changes in the IT industry may also affect the demand for the Company\u2019s advanced professional and managed services. The Company has invested a significant amount of capital in personnel, and this strategy may adversely impact its financial position due to competition or changes in the industry or improper focus or selection of the products and services the Company decides to offer. If the Company fails to react in a timely manner to such changes, its results of operations may be adversely affected. The Company\u2019s sales can be dependent on demand for specific product categories, and any change in demand for or supply of such products could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations.\nA substantial or an extended decline in oil and gas prices could result in lower expenditures by the Company\u2019s customers in the oil and gas industry, which could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDemand for the Company\u2019s products and services depends on expenditures by its customers involved in the oil and natural gas industry. These expenditures are generally dependent on the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 views of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to its customers\u2019 views of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. Declines, as well as anticipated declines, in oil and gas prices could result in project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to the Company. These effects could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns, which have been characterized by diminished demand for the Company\u2019s products and services as well as and downward pressure on the prices it charges. Sustained market uncertainty can also result in lower demand and pricing for the Company\u2019s products and services within such industry. A significant downturn or sustained market uncertainty could result in a reduction in demand for the Company\u2019s services and could adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company may fail to innovate or create new solutions which align with changing market and customer demand.\nAs a provider of a comprehensive set of solutions, which involves the offering of bundled solutions consisting of direct IT sales, advanced professional and managed services, the Company expects to encounter some of the challenges, risks, difficulties, and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies providing bundled solutions in rapidly evolving markets. Some of these challenges include the Company\u2019s ability to increase the total number of users of its services or adapt to meet changes in its markets and competitive developments. The Company\u2019s personnel must continually stay current with vendor and marketplace technology advancements, create solutions which may integrate evolving vendor products and services as well as services and solutions the Company provides, to meet changing marketplace and customer demand. Further, the Company may provide customized solutions and services that are solely reliant on its own marketing, design and fulfillment services, and the Company may lack the skills or personnel to execute. The Company\u2019s failure to innovate and provide value to its customers may erode its competitive position and market share and may lead to a decrease in revenue and financial performance.\nIn all of the Company\u2019s markets, some of its competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources than the Company does. In addition, some of these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities, technologies, and customer requirements. Many current and potential competitors engage in more extensive promotional marketing and advertising activities, offer more attractive terms to customers, and adopt more aggressive pricing and credit policies than the Company does. The Company may not be successful in achieving revenue growth which may have a material adverse effect on its future operating results as a whole.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on its vendor partner relationships and the availability of their products.\nThe Company\u2019s solutions portfolio includes products from OEMs, software publishers and cloud providers. The Company is authorized by these vendor partners to sell all or some of their products via direct marketing activities. Its authorization with each vendor partner is subject to specific terms and conditions regarding such things as sales channel restrictions, product return privileges, price protection policies, purchase discounts and vendor partner programs and funding, including purchase rebates, sales volume rebates, purchasing incentives and cooperative advertising reimbursements. However, the Company does not have any long-term contracts with its vendor partners and many of these arrangements are terminable upon notice by either party. A reduction in vendor partner programs or funding or the Company\u2019s failure to timely react to changes in vendor partner programs or funding could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, a reduction in the amount or a change in the terms of credit granted to the Company by its vendor partners could increase the Company\u2019s need for, and the cost of, working capital and could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or cash flows, particularly given the Company\u2019s substantial indebtedness.\nFrom time to time, vendor partners may terminate or limit the Company\u2019s right to sell some or all of their products or change the terms and conditions or reduce or discontinue the incentives that they offer the Company. For example, there is no assurance that, as the Company\u2019s vendor partners continue to sell directly to end users and through resellers, they will not limit or curtail the availability of their products to solutions providers like the Company. Any such termination or limitation or the implementation of such changes could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company purchases the products included in its solutions portfolio both directly from its vendor partners and from wholesale distributors. Although the Company purchases from a diverse vendor base, in the year ended December 31, 2019, products it purchased from wholesale distributors Ingram Micro and Techdata, both represented more than 5% of total purchases. In addition, sales of products manufactured by Cisco, Dell, and Nutanix whether purchased directly from these vendor partners or from a wholesale distributor, represented in the aggregate nearly 30% of the Company\u2019s fiscal year 2019 consolidated net sales. The loss of, or change in business relationship with, any of these or any other key vendor partners, or the diminished availability of their products, including due to backlogs for their products, could reduce the supply and increase the cost of products the Company sells and negatively impact its competitive position.\nAdditionally, the relocation of key distributors utilized in the Company\u2019s purchasing model could increase its need for, and the cost of, working capital and have an adverse effect on its business, results of operations or cash flows. Further, the sale, spin-off or combination of any of the Company\u2019s vendor partners and/or certain of their business units, including any such sale to or combination with a vendor with whom the Company does not currently have a commercial relationship or whose products the Company does not sell, could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or cash flows.\nBreaches of data security and the failure to protect the Company\u2019s information technology systems from cybersecurity threats could adversely impact its business.\nThe Company\u2019s business involves the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of its employees, customers and others. In addition, the Company operates data centers for its customers that host their technology infrastructure and may store and transmit both business-critical data and confidential information. In connection with the Company\u2019s services business, some of its employees also have access to its customers\u2019 confidential data and other information. The Company has privacy and data security policies in place that are designed to prevent security breaches\u037e however, as newer technologies evolve, and the portfolio of the service providers with which the Company shares confidential information with grows, the Company could be exposed to increased risk of breaches in security and other illegal or fraudulent acts, including cyberattacks. The evolving nature of such threats, in light of new and sophisticated methods used by criminals and cyberterrorists, including computer viruses, malware, phishing, misrepresentation, social engineering and forgery, are making it increasingly challenging to anticipate and adequately mitigate these risks.\nThe Company may not be able to hire and/or retain personnel that it needs.\nTo increase market awareness and sales of the Company\u2019s offerings, the Company may need to expand its marketing efforts and sales operations in the future. The Company\u2019s products and services require a sophisticated sales effort and significant technical engineering talent. For example, its sales and engineering candidates must have highly technical hardware and software knowledge to create a customized solution for its customers\u2019 business processes. Competition for qualified sales, marketing and engineering personnel fluctuates depending on market conditions, and the Company may not be able to hire or retain sufficient personnel to maintain and grow its business. Frequently, the Company\u2019s competitors require their employees to agree to non-compete and non-solicitation agreements as part of their employment. This makes it more difficult for the Company to hire and increases the Company\u2019s costs by reviewing and managing non-compete restrictions. Additionally, in some cases the Company\u2019s relationship with a customer may be impacted by turnover in its sales or engineering team. For example, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, several sales representatives and managers voluntarily resigned their employment with the Company. These sales representatives and managers were the relationship managers to a number of the Company\u2019s customers. The loss of these customers adversely affected the net sales of the Company for fiscal year 2019 and could have the same effect on subsequent periods if such lost sales are not offset by the Company\u2019s new sales representatives and newly acquired customers.\nThe Company faces substantial competition from other companies.\nIn its technology segment, the Company competes in all areas of its business against local, regional, national, and international firms, including other direct marketers\u037e national and regional resellers\u037e online marketplace competitors\u037e and regional and national service providers. In addition, the Company faces competition from vendors, which may choose to market their products directly to end-users, rather than through channel partners such as the Company, and this could adversely affect the Company\u2019s future sales. Many competitors compete based principally on price and may have lower costs or accept lower selling prices than the Company does and, therefore, the Company\u2019s gross margins may not be maintainable. Online market place competitors are continually improving their pricing and offerings to customers as well as ease of use of their online marketplaces. The Company\u2019s competitors may offer better or different products and services than the Company offers. In addition, the Company does not have guaranteed purchasing volume commitments from its customers and, therefore, its sales volume may be volatile.\nThe Company may not have designed or maintained its IT systems to support its business.\nThe Company depends heavily upon the accuracy and reliability of its information, telecommunication, cybersecurity and other systems including the operation of redundant systems if there are failures in its primary systems, which are used for customer management, sales, distribution, marketing, purchasing, inventory management, order processing and fulfillment, customer service and general accounting functions. The Company must continually maintain, secure and improve its systems. The protections the Company has in place address a variety of threats to its information technology systems, both internal and external, including human error. Inadequate security practices or design of the Company\u2019s IT systems, or IT systems from third-parties which it utilizes, or third-party service providers\u2019 failure to provide adequate services could result in the disclosure of sensitive or confidential information or personal information or cause other business interruptions that could damage the Company\u2019s reputation and disrupt its business. Inadequate design or interruption of the Company\u2019s information systems, Internet availability, telecommunications systems or power failures could have a material adverse effect on its business, its reputation, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s managed services business requires it to monitor its customers\u2019 devices on their networks across varying levels of service. If the Company has not designed its IT systems to provide this service accurately or if there is a security breach in its IT system or the customers\u2019 systems, the Company may be liable for claims.\nThe Company relies on the competency of its internal IT personnel. The Company\u2019s failure to hire, develop, retain, and supervise competent IT personnel to secure its data, design redundant systems, or design and maintain its technology systems including its data and voice networks, and applications, could significantly interrupt its business causing a negative impact on its results.\nThe Company may not adequately protect itself through its contracts, or its insurance policies may not be adequate to address potential losses or claims.\nThe Company\u2019s contracts may not protect it against the risks inherent in its business including, but not limited to, warranties, limitations of liability, indemnification obligations, human resources and subcontractor-related claims, patent and product liability, regulatory and compliance obligations, and data security and privacy. Also, the Company faces pressure from its customers for competitive pricing and contract terms. The Company also is subject to audits by various vendor partners and customers relating to purchases and sales under various contracts. In addition, the Company is subject to indemnification claims under various contracts.\nThe Company depends on having creditworthy customers to avoid an adverse impact on its operating results and financial condition.\nIf the credit quality of the Company\u2019s customer base materially decreases, or if the Company experiences a material increase in its credit losses, the Company may find it difficult to continue to obtain the required capital for its business, and its operating results and financial condition may be harmed. In addition to the impact on the Company\u2019s ability to attract capital, a material increase in its delinquency and default experience would itself have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to successfully attract and retain qualified sales personnel is important to its success.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on its ability to attract, motivate, and retain a sufficient number of qualified sales representatives, who understand and appreciate the Company\u2019s strategy and culture and are able to adequately represent the Company to its customers. Qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas. If the Company is unable to hire and retain personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service its sales could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, any material increases in existing employee turnover rates or increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or operating results.\nThe Company may be liable for misuse of its customers\u2019 or employees\u2019 information.\nThird-parties, such as hackers, could circumvent or sabotage the security practices and products used in the Company\u2019s product and service offerings, and/or the security practices or products used in the Company\u2019s internal IT systems, which could result in disclosure of sensitive or personal information, unauthorized procurement, or other business interruptions that could damage the Company\u2019s reputation and disrupt its business. Attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats.\nIf third-parties or the Company\u2019s employees are able to maliciously penetrate its network security or otherwise misappropriate its customers\u2019 information or employees\u2019 personal information, or other information for which its customers may be responsible and for which the Company agrees to be responsible in connection with service contracts into which it may enter, or if the Company gives third-parties or its employees improper access to certain information, the Company could be subject to liability. This liability could include claims for unauthorized access to devices on its network\u037e unauthorized access to its customers\u2019 networks, applications, data, devices, or software\u037e and identity theft or other similar fraud-related claims. This liability could also include claims for other misuses of or inappropriate access to personal information. Other liability could include claims alleging misrepresentation of the Company\u2019s privacy and data security practices. Any such liability for misappropriation of this information could decrease the Company\u2019s profitability. In addition, federal and state agencies have been investigating various companies regarding whether they misused or inadequately secured information. The Company could incur additional expenses when new laws or regulations regarding the use of information are enacted, or if governmental agencies require the Company to substantially modify its privacy or security practices. The Company could fail to comply with applicable data privacy laws, the violation of which may result in audits, fines, penalties, litigation, or administrative enforcement actions with associated costs.\nAdvances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, or other events or developments may result in a compromise or breach of the security practices the Company uses to protect sensitive customer transaction information and employee information. A party who is able to circumvent the Company\u2019s security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in the Company\u2019s operations. Further, third-parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords, or other information or otherwise compromise the security of the Company\u2019s internal networks and/or its customers\u2019 information. Since techniques used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and the size and severity of security breaches are increasing, the Company may be unable to implement adequate preventative measures or timely identify or stop security breaches while they are occurring.\nThe Company may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to remediate the subsequent risks and issues caused by such breaches. The Company\u2019s security measures are designed to protect against security breaches, but its failure to prevent such security breaches could cause it to incur significant expense to investigate and respond to a security breach and correct any problems caused by any breach, subject it to liability, damage its reputation, and diminish the value of its brand. There can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in Company contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect the Company from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim. The Company also cannot be sure that its existing insurance coverage for errors and omissions or security breaches will continue to be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that its insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against the Company that exceeds its available insurance coverage, or changes in its insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with new laws or changes to existing laws may adversely impact the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to numerous U.S. laws and regulations in a number of areas including, but not limited to, areas of labor and employment, immigration, advertising, e-commerce, tax, import and export requirements, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, and environmental, health, and safety. Compliance with these laws, regulations, and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business, and the risk of noncompliance. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to help comply with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no certainty that employees, contractors, or agents will fully comply with laws and regulations or the Company\u2019s policies and procedures.\nLoss of services by any of the Company\u2019s executive officers or senior management and/or failure to successfully implement a succession plan could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe loss of the services by the Company\u2019s executive officers or senior management and/or failure to successfully implement a succession plan could disrupt management of the Company\u2019s business and impair the execution of its business strategies. The Company believes that its success depends in part upon its ability to retain the services of its executive officers and senior management and successfully implement a succession plan. The Company\u2019s executive officers are at the forefront in determining its strategic direction and focus. The loss of its executive officers\u2019 and senior management\u2019s services without replacement by qualified successors could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to manage effectively its overall operations and successfully execute current or future business strategies, and could cause other instability within the Company\u2019s workforce.\nThe Company relies on its primary credit facility for working capital and its accounts payable processing.\nThe loss of the Company\u2019s primary credit facility with Comerica Bank pursuant to the Credit Agreement could have a material adverse effect on its future results as it relies on this facility and its components for daily working capital and the operational function of its accounts payable process. The Credit Agreement contains various covenants that must be met each quarter and either party may terminate the agreement for any reason with a 90-days\u2019 notice. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to meet those covenants and failure to do so may limit availability of, or cause the Company to lose, such financing. There can be no assurance that such financing will continue to be available to the Company in the future on acceptable terms.\nChanges in accounting standards, or the misapplication of current accounting standards, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s future financial results.\nThe Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). These accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), the SEC, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (\u201cAICPA\u201d) and various other bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies. Future periodic assessments required by current or new accounting standards may result in noncash charges and/or changes in presentation or disclosure. In addition, any change in accounting standards may influence the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 decision to purchase from the Company or finance transactions with the Company, which could have a significant adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position or results of operations.\nThe Company is required to determine if it is the principal or agent in all transactions with its customers. The voluminous number of products and services the Company sells, and the manner in which they are bundled, are technologically complex. Mischaracterization of these products and services could result in misapplication of revenue recognition polices. The Company uses estimates where necessary, such as the fair value of assets acquired, and liabilities assumed in a business combination, the analysis for goodwill impairment, allowance for doubtful accounts and the cost to perform professional and managed services, which require judgment and are based on best available information. If the Company is unable to accurately estimate the cost of these services or the time-line for completion of contracts, the profitability of its contracts may be materially and adversely affected.\nA natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at one of the Company\u2019s facilities could damage its business.\nThe Company has one warehouse and distribution facility in the U.S. If the warehouse and distribution equipment at its distribution center were to be seriously damaged by a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence, the Company could utilize another distribution center or third-party distributors to ship products to its customers. However, this may not be sufficient to avoid interruptions in the Company\u2019s service and may not enable the Company to meet all of the needs of its customers and would cause the Company to incur incremental operating costs. In addition, the Company operates two customer facing data centers which contain its Securities Operations Center, Network Operations Center, and numerous sales offices which may contain both business-critical data and confidential information of the Company\u2019s customers. A natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at any of the customer data centers or at any of the Company\u2019s major sales offices could negatively impact its business, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company could be exposed to additional risks if it continues to make strategic investments or acquisitions or enter into alliances.\nThe Company may continue to pursue transactions, including strategic investments, acquisitions or alliances, in an effort to extend or complement its existing business. These types of transactions involve numerous business risks, including finding suitable transaction partners and negotiating terms that are acceptable to the Company, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, extending the Company\u2019s product or service offerings into areas in which the Company has limited experience, entering into new geographic markets, the potential loss of key coworkers or business relationships and successfully integrating acquired businesses. There can be no assurance that the intended benefits of the Company\u2019s investments, acquisitions and alliances will be realized, or that those benefits will offset these numerous risks or other unforeseen factors, any of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s financial results could be adversely affected by financial adjustments required by U.S. GAAP in connection with these types of transactions where significant goodwill or intangible assets are recorded. To the extent the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives becomes impaired, the Company may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets.\nThe Company may be required to take impairment charges for goodwill or other intangible assets related to acquisitions.\nThe Company has acquired certain portions of its business and assets through acquisitions. Further, as part of its long-term business strategy, the Company may continue to pursue acquisitions of other companies or assets. In connection with prior acquisitions, the Company has accounted for the portion of the purchase price paid in excess of the book value of the assets acquired as goodwill or intangible assets, and it may be required to account for similar premiums paid on future acquisitions in the same manner.\nUnder the applicable accounting principles, goodwill is not amortized and is carried on the Company\u2019s books at its original value, subject to annual review and evaluation for impairment, whereas intangible assets are amortized over the life of the asset. Changes in the business itself, the economic environment (including business valuation levels and trends), or the legislative or regulatory environment may trigger a review and evaluation of the Company\u2019s goodwill and intangible assets for potential impairment outside of the normal review periods. These changes may adversely affect either the fair value of the business or the Company\u2019s individual reporting units and the Company may be required to take an impairment charge.\nIf market and economic conditions deteriorate, this could increase the likelihood that the Company will need to record impairment charges to the extent the carrying value of its goodwill exceeds the fair value of its overall business. Such impairment charges could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s net earnings during the period in which the charge is taken. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had goodwill and other intangible assets of $21.2 million and $2.4 million, respectively.\nThe Company faces risks of claims from third-parties for intellectual property infringement, including counterfeit products, that could harm its business.\nThe Company may be subject to claims that products that it resells infringe on the intellectual property rights of third-parties and/or are counterfeit products. The vendor of certain products or services the Company resells may not provide the Company with indemnification for infringement or indemnification\u037e however, the Company\u2019s customers may seek indemnification from the Company. The Company could incur substantial costs in defending infringement claims against itself and its customers. In the event of such claims, the Company and its customers may be required to obtain one or more licenses from third-parties. The Company may not be able to obtain such licenses from third-parties at a reasonable cost or at all. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any such required license could significantly increase the Company\u2019s expenses and/or adversely affect its ability to offer one or more of its services.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nThe Company has a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could have important consequences to its business.\nThe Company has a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of March 31, 2020, the Company had $16.4 million of total debt outstanding, as defined by U.S. GAAP, and $0.2 million of obligations outstanding under equipment financing agreements, and the ability to borrow an additional $10.9 million under the Credit Agreement, subject to a borrowing base and a liquidity condition. The Company\u2019s substantial indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u25cf making it more difficult for the Company to satisfy its obligations with respect to its indebtedness\u037e\n\u25cf requiring the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to debt service payments on its and its subsidiaries\u2019 debt, which reduces the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes\u037e\n\u25cf requiring the Company to comply with restrictive covenants in the Credit Agreement, which limit the manner in which it conducts its business\u037e\n\u25cf making it more difficult for the Company to obtain vendor financing from its vendor partners, including original equipment manufacturers and software publishers\u037e\n\u25cf limiting the Company\u2019s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industry in which it operates\u037e\n\u25cf placing the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to any of its less-leveraged competitors\u037e\n\u25cf increasing the Company\u2019s vulnerability to both general and industry-specific adverse economic conditions\u037e and\n\u25cf limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements and increasing its cost of borrowing.\nRestrictive covenants under the Credit Agreement may adversely affect its operations and liquidity.\nThe Credit Agreement contains and any future indebtedness of the Company may contain, various covenants that limit its ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf incur or guarantee additional debt\u037e\n\u25cf pay dividends or make distributions to holders of the Company\u2019s capital stock or to make certain other restricted payments or investments\u037e\n\u25cf repurchase or redeem capital stock\u037e\n\u25cf make loans, capital expenditures or investments or acquisitions\u037e\n\u25cf receive dividends or other payments from its subsidiaries\u037e\n\u25cf enter into transactions with affiliates\u037e\n\u25cf pledge its assets as collateral\u037e\n\u25cf merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer all or substantially all of its assets\u037e\n\u25cf transfer or sell assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries\u037e and\n\u25cf prepay, repurchase or redeem debt.\nAs a result of these covenants, the Company is limited in the manner in which it conducts its business and it may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. A breach of any of these covenants or any of the other covenants in the Credit Agreement (including without limitation financial covenants) would result in a default under the Credit Agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Agreement, the lenders:\n\u25cf will not be required to lend any additional amounts to the Company\u037e\n\u25cf could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding thereunder, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable\u037e or\n\u25cf could require the Company to apply all of its available cash to repay these borrowings.\nIf the Company were unable to repay those amounts, the lender under the Credit Agreement could proceed against the collateral granted to it to secure the Company\u2019s borrowings thereunder. The Company has pledged a significant portion of its assets as collateral under the Credit Agreement. If the lender under the Credit Agreement accelerates the repayment of borrowings, the Company cannot assure you that it will have sufficient assets to repay the Credit Agreement and its other indebtedness or the ability to borrow sufficient funds to refinance such indebtedness. Even if the Company were able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms, or terms that are acceptable to the Company.\nAs of March 31, 2020, under the Credit Agreement\u2019s revolving credit facility, the Company is permitted to borrow up to $20.0 million. However, its ability to borrow under the Credit Agreement is limited by a borrowing base and a liquidity condition. The borrowing base at any time equals the sum of up to 85% of eligible accounts receivable plus 50% of eligible inventory. The borrowing base in effect as of March 31, 2020 was $10.4 million and, therefore, did restrict the Company\u2019s ability to borrow under the Credit Agreement as of that date.\nThe Company will be required to generate sufficient cash to service its indebtedness and, if not successful, the Company may be forced to take other actions to satisfy its obligations under its indebtedness.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance its debt obligations depends on its financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond its control. The Company\u2019s outstanding long-term debt will impose significant cash interest payment obligations on the Company and, accordingly, the Company will have to generate significant cash flow from operating activities to fund its debt service obligations. The Company cannot assure you that it will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit it to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on its indebtedness.\nIf the Company\u2019s cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund its debt service obligations, the Company may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital, restructure or refinance its indebtedness, or revise or delay its strategic plan. The Company cannot assure you that it would be able to take any of these actions on terms that are favorable to the Company or at all, that these actions would be successful and permit the Company to meet its scheduled debt service obligations or satisfy its capital requirements, or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of its existing or future debt agreements, including the Credit Agreement. In the absence of such operating results and resources, the Company could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet its debt service and other obligations. The Credit Agreement restricts the Company\u2019s ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition. The Company may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which it could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nIf the Company cannot make scheduled payments on its debt, it will be in default and, as a result:\n\u25cf the Company\u2019s debt holders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable\u037e\n\u25cf the lenders under the Credit Agreement could foreclose against the assets securing the borrowings from them and the lenders under the Credit Agreement could terminate their commitments to lend it money\u037e and\n\u25cf the Company could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nDespite the Company\u2019s indebtedness levels, the Company may be able to incur substantially more debt, including secured debt. This could further increase the risks associated with its leverage.\nThe Company may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of the Credit Agreement do not fully prohibit it from doing so. To the extent that the Company incurs additional indebtedness, the risks associated with its substantial indebtedness described above, including its possible inability to service its debt, will increase. As of March 31, 2020, the Company had $10.9 million available for additional borrowing under the Credit Agreement, subject to a borrowing base and a liquidity condition.\nVariable rate indebtedness subjects the Company to interest rate risk, which could cause its debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s borrowings, primarily borrowings under the Credit Agreement, are at variable rates of interest and expose the Company to interest rate risk. As of March 31, 2020, the Company had $15.8 million of variable rate debt outstanding. If interest rates increase, the Company\u2019s debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and its net income would decrease.\nRisks Related to Our Securities and the Business Combination\nNasdaq may delist our securities from quotation on its exchange which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur common stock and warrants are currently listed on Nasdaq. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to meet Nasdaq\u2019s listing standards with respect to our securities. If Nasdaq delists our common stock from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the listing standards, we and our stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for our securities\u037e\n\u25cf reduced liquidity with respect to our securities\u037e\n\u25cf a determination that our shares of common stock are \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our shares of common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares of common stock\u037e\n\u25cf a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company\u037e and\n\u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nOn April 9, 2020, the Company received a letter (the \u201cDetermination Letter\u201d) from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it had not complied with the requirements of Nasdaq Listing Rule IM-5101-2, which requires that the Company meet the requirements for initial listing after completion of the Business Combination. The Determination Letter stated that the Company\u2019s common stock does not meet the minimum $4.00 bid price and the $15 million market value of publicly held shares requirements, which are set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5505. On May 27, 2020 Nasdaq granted the Company an extension to September 7, 2020 to demonstrate compliance Nasdaq Listing Rule IM-5101-2.\nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as \u201ccovered securities.\u201d Because our common stock and warrants are currently listed on Nasdaq, our common stock and warrants are covered securities. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. Further, if we were no longer listed on Nasdaq, our securities would not be covered securities and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.\nIf the Business Combination\u2019s benefits do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the market price of our securities may decline.\nIf the benefits of the Business Combination do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the market price of our securities may decline. Fluctuations in the price of our securities could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment. Prior to the Business Combination, there was not a public market for Computex\u2019s securities. Even if an active market for our securities develops and continues, the trading price of our securities could be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on your investment in our securities and our securities may trade at prices significantly below the price you paid for them. In such circumstances, the trading price of our securities may not recover and may experience a further decline.\nFactors affecting the trading price of our securities may include:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us\u037e\n\u25cf changes in the market\u2019s expectations about our operating results\u037e\n\u25cf success of competitors\u037e\n\u25cf our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period\u037e\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning the Company or the IT industry in general\u037e\n\u25cf operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to the Company\u037e\n\u25cf our ability to market new and enhanced products on a timely basis\u037e\n\u25cf changes in laws and regulations affecting our business\u037e\n\u25cf our ability to meet compliance requirements\u037e\n\u25cf commencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving the Company\u037e\n\u25cf changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt\u037e\n\u25cf the volume of shares of our common stock available for public sale\u037e\n\u25cf any major change in our board of directors or management\u037e\n\u25cf sales of substantial amounts of common stock by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur\u037e and\n\u25cf general economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations, acts of war or terrorism and global health crises, including the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\nBroad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our securities irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general, and Nasdaq in particular, have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for retail stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to the Company could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our securities also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe JOBS Act permits the Company to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies for so long as the Company is an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nThe Company qualifies as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, the Company is eligible for and intends to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies for as long as it continues to be an emerging growth company, including (i) the exemption from the auditor attestation requirements with respect to internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) the exemptions from say-on-pay, say-on-frequency and say-on-golden parachute voting requirements and (iii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements. The Company will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which the market value of its common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30 of that fiscal year, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which it has total annual gross revenue of $1.07 billion or more during such fiscal year, (iii) the date on which it has issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in the prior three-year period or (iv) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of its common stock in the IPO, which would be December 31, 2022. If the Company continues to expand its business through acquisitions and/or continues to grow revenues organically, we may cease to be an emerging growth company prior to December 31, 2022.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act as long as such company is an emerging growth company. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the same time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. Investors may find our common stock less attractive because the Company will rely on these exemptions, which may result in a less active trading market for our common stock and its stock price may be more volatile.\nOur management and their affiliates control a substantial interest in us and thus may influence certain actions requiring a stockholder vote.\nAs of June 26, 2020, our management and their affiliates beneficially own approximately 86.0% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, including an aggregate of 18,787,253 shares underlying warrants and convertible debentures. Accordingly, these individuals would have considerable influence regarding the outcome of any transaction that requires stockholder approval. Furthermore, our board of directors is divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. As a consequence of our \u201cstaggered board,\u201d only a minority of our board of directors will be considered for election in any given year and our management and their affiliates, because of their ownership position, will have considerable influence regarding the outcome of such elections.\nWe may not be able to timely and effectively implement controls and procedures required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that are applicable to us.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. To comply with the requirements of being a public company, we are required to provide attestation on internal controls, and we may need to undertake various actions, such as implementing additional internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff. The standards required for a public company under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are significantly more stringent than those that were required of Computex as a privately held company. Management may not be able to effectively and timely implement controls and procedures that adequately respond to the increased regulatory compliance and reporting requirements that are applicable to us after the Business Combination. If we are not able to implement the additional requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, the Company may not be able to assess whether its internal control over financial reporting is effective, which may subject it to adverse regulatory consequences and could harm investor confidence and the market price of our common stock. Further, as an emerging growth company, our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until the date we are no longer an emerging growth company. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event that it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating.\nIn addition, our management and other personnel will need to continue to devote a substantial amount of time to compliance initiative applicable to public companies, including compliance with Section 404 and the evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting within the prescribed timeframe. In connection with the audit of Computex\u2019s consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, certain material weaknesses and significant deficiencies were identified in its internal control over financial reporting. The Company has begun the process of evaluating the adequacy of its accounting personnel staffing level and other matters related to internal control over financial reporting to remediate these deficiencies. The Company may discover additional deficiencies in existing systems and controls that it may not be able to remediate in an efficient or timely manner.\nProvisions in our Charter and Bylaws and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management.\nOur Charter and Bylaws contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. Our board of directors is divided into three classes, each of which serves for a term of three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. As a result, at a given annual meeting only a minority of the board of directors may be considered for election. Since our \u201cstaggered board\u201d may prevent our stockholders from replacing a majority of our board of directors at any given annual meeting, it may entrench management and discourage unsolicited stockholder proposals that may be in the best interests of stockholders. Moreover, our board of directors has the ability to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock.\nWe are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together these provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, investments and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, we are required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur Charter provides, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\nOur Charter provides, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in our name, actions against directors, officers and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and, if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder\u2019s counsel\u037e provided that the exclusive forum provision will not apply to (i) suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act, (ii) any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction, (iii) any claim as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (iv) any claim which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or (v) any claim for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. Furthermore, our Charter also provides that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such provision with respect to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our Charter.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims, although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our Charter to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that they might occur, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nAs of March 31, 2020, we had warrants to purchase an aggregate of 25,531,250 shares of common stock outstanding. In connection with the IPO, we issued unit purchase options to purchase 1,350,000 units which, if exercised, will result in the issuance of up to 1,485,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase an additional 675,000 shares of common stock. Additionally, the PIPE Debentures (\u201cPIPE Debentures\u201d) are convertible, in whole or in part, at any time at the option of the holder thereof into that number of shares of common stock calculated by dividing the principal amount being converted, together with all accrued but unpaid interest thereon, by the applicable conversion price, and are subject to mandatory conversion under certain conditions, as described elsewhere in this Current Report on Form 10-K. To the extent such warrants, unit purchase options or PIPE Debentures are exercised or converted, as applicable, additional shares of common stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to our stockholders and increase the number of shares of common stock eligible for resale in the public market. In addition, pursuant to the Incentive Plan, equity incentive awards representing an aggregate of up to 5,794,500 shares of our common stock were available for issuance as of June 26, 2020. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market or the fact that the warrants, unit purchase options or PIPE Debentures may be exercised or converted, as applicable, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock or on our ability to obtain future financing.\nBecause we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nWe may retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion and debt repayment and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends as a public company in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends may be limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell your shares of common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nFollowing the consummation of the Business Combination, the Company has incurred and will continue to incur significant increased expenses and administrative burdens as a public company, which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFollowing the consummation of the Business Combination, the Company has face increased legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses as a public company that Computex did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including the requirements of Section 404, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and the rules and regulations promulgated and to be promulgated thereunder, the PCAOB and the securities exchanges, impose additional reporting and other obligations on public companies. Compliance with public company requirements will increase costs and make certain activities more time-consuming. A number of those requirements will require the Company to carry out activities Computex has not done previously. In addition, additional expenses associated with SEC reporting requirements have been and will continue to be incurred. In connection with the audit of Computex\u2019s consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, certain material weaknesses and significant deficiencies were identified in its internal control over financial reporting. The Company has begun the process of evaluating the adequacy of its accounting personnel staffing level and other matters related to internal control over financial reporting to remediate these deficiencies. Furthermore, if any issues in complying with those requirements are identified (for example, if the auditors identify additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in the internal control over financial reporting), the Company could incur additional costs rectifying those issues, and the existence of those issues could adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation or investor perceptions of it. It may also be more expensive to obtain director and officer liability insurance. Risks associated with the Company\u2019s status as a public company may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on the board of directors or as executive officers. The additional reporting and other obligations imposed by these rules and regulations will increase legal and financial compliance costs and the costs of related legal, accounting and administrative activities. These increased costs will require the Company to divert a significant amount of money that could otherwise be used to expand the business and achieve strategic objectives. Advocacy efforts by stockholders and third parties may also prompt additional changes in governance and reporting requirements, which could further increase costs.\nOur public stockholders at the time of the Business Combination who purchased their units in our initial public offering and who did not exercise their redemption rights may pursue rescission rights and related claims.\nOur public stockholders may allege that some aspects of the Business Combination were inconsistent with the disclosure contained in the final prospectus for our initial public offering of units, including the structure of the Business Combination. Consequently, a public stockholder who purchased shares in the initial public offering (excluding the Initial Stockholders) and still held them at the time of the Business Combination and who did not seek to exercise redemption rights might seek rescission of the purchase of the units such holder acquired in the initial public offering. A successful claimant for damages under federal or state law could be awarded an amount to compensate for the decrease in the value of such holder\u2019s shares caused by the alleged violation (including, possibly, punitive damages), together with interest, while retaining the shares. If public stockholders bring successful rescission claims against the Company, our results of operations could be adversely affected and we may be required in connection with the defense of such claims to incur expenses and divert employee attention from other business matters.\nFuture issuances of any equity securities may dilute the interests of our stockholders and decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nAny future issuance of equity securities could dilute the interests of our stockholders and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock. We may issue equity or equity-linked securities in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance the Company\u2019s operations and business strategy (including in connection with acquisitions and other transactions), to adjust the Company\u2019s ratio of debt to equity, to satisfy its obligations upon the exercise of then-outstanding options or other equity-linked securities, if any, or for other reasons.", "PERMNO": 16911, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "AVCT"}
