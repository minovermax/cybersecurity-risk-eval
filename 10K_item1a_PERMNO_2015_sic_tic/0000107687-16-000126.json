{"cik": "107687", "company": "WINNEBAGO INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-10-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors should be considered carefully in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face, but represent the most significant risk factors that we believe may adversely affect the RV industry and our business, operations or financial position. The risks and uncertainties discussed in this report are not exclusive and other risk factors that we may consider immaterial or do not anticipate may emerge as significant risks and uncertainties.\nCompetition\nThe market for RVs is very competitive. Competitive factors in this industry include price, design, value, quality, service, brand awareness and reputation. There can be no assurance that existing or new competitors will not develop products that are superior to our RVs or that achieve better consumer acceptance, thereby adversely affecting our market share, sales volume and profit margins. Some of our competitors are much larger than us, most notably in the towable RV market, which provide these competitors with more financial resources and access to capital as well as additional purchasing power. In addition, competition could increase if new companies enter the market, existing competitors consolidate their operations or if existing competitors expand their product lines or intensify efforts within existing product lines. Our current products, products under development, and our ability to develop new and improved products may be insufficient to enable us to compete effectively with our competitors. These competitive pressures may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nHiring Constraints and Retaining Key Employees\nOur ability to meet our strategic objectives and otherwise grow our business will depend to a significant extent on the continued contributions of our leadership team. Our future success will also depend in large part on our ability to identify, attract, and retain other highly qualified managerial, technical, sales and marketing, operations, and customer service personnel. Our main motorhome operation is located in northern Iowa, a largely rural area. Competition for these individuals is intense and supply is limited. We may not succeed in identifying, attracting, or retaining qualified personnel on a cost-effective basis. The loss or interruption of services of any of our key personnel, inability to identify, attract, or retain qualified personnel in the future, delays in hiring qualified personnel, or any employee work slowdowns, strikes, or similar actions could make it difficult for us to conduct and manage our business and meet key objectives, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nProduction Disruptions\nWe currently manufacture most of our products at two locations in the U.S. One of these locations produces approximately 80% of our products. These facilities may be affected by natural or man-made disasters and other external events. In the event that one of our manufacturing facilities was affected by a disaster or other event, we could be forced to shift production to one of our other manufacturing facilities or to cease operations. Although we maintain insurance for damage to our property and disruption of our\nbusiness from casualties, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses. Any disruption in our manufacturing capacity could have an adverse impact on our ability to produce sufficient inventory of our products or may require us to incur additional expenses in order to produce sufficient inventory, and therefore, may adversely affect our net sales and operating results. Any disruption or delay at our manufacturing facilities could impair our ability to meet the demands of our customers, and our customers may cancel orders or purchase products from our competitors, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Recently Announced Potential Acquisition\nIn connection with our recently announced agreement to acquire Grand Design, there are significant risks relating to the consummation of our acquisition including, the possibility that the closing conditions to the contemplated transaction may not be satisfied or waived, including that a governmental entity may prohibit, delay or refuse to grant a necessary regulatory approval; delay in closing the transaction or the possibility of non-consummation of the transaction; the potential for regulatory authorities to require divestitures in connection with the proposed transaction, the failure to consummate the debt transactions contemplated by the transaction with Grand Design, the possibility that we might have to pay a $35.0 million termination fee to Grand Design or additional damages for failing to close the transaction; the occurrence of any event that could give rise to termination of the agreement; the risk that shareholder litigation in connection with the contemplated transaction may affect the timing or occurrence of the contemplated transaction or result in significant costs of defense, indemnification and liability; risks inherent in the achievement of cost synergies and the timing thereof; risks that the pendency, financing, and efforts to consummate the transaction may be disruptive to Winnebago Industries or Grand Design RV or their respective management; the effect of announcement of the transaction on Grand Design\u2019s ability to retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with customers, suppliers and other third parties, and risks related to integration of the two companies.\nThe Company\u2019s Stock Price is Subject to Volatility\nOur stock price may fluctuate based on many factors. Our recently announced and pending acquisition of Grand Design, for example, provides important strategic positioning and earnings growth potential and will also result in the issuance of new shares of common stock to partially finance the transaction. We have agreed to issue $105.0 million worth of common stock to the owners of Grand Design and register these shares for resale after the transaction closes. Stock issuance may cause dilution of earnings per share or put selling pressure on our share price. Changing credit agreements and leverage ratios may also impact stock price. In general, analysts expectations and our ability to meet those expectations quarterly may cause stock price fluctuations. If we fail to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, debt repayment, dividends, share issuance or repurchase or other market expectations our stock price may decline significantly.\nFacility Expansion and Diversification\nWe are expanding our production capabilities at our site in Junction City, Oregon. The expansion and renovation entails risks that could cause disruption in the operations of our business and unanticipated cost increases. Should we experience production variances, quality or safety issues as we ramp up these operations our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nAdverse Effects of Union Activities\nAlthough none of our employees are currently represented by a labor union, unionization could result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages. We are, directly or indirectly, dependent upon companies with unionized work forces, such as parts suppliers and trucking and freight companies, and work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or operating results. If a work stoppage occurs, it could delay the manufacture and sale of our recreational vehicles and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results or financial condition.\nGeneral Economic Conditions and Certain Other External Factors\nCompanies within the RV industry are subject to volatility in operating results due primarily to general economic conditions because the purchase of an RV is often viewed as a consumer discretionary purchase. Demand for discretionary goods in general can fluctuate with recessionary conditions; slow or negative economic growth rates; negative consumer confidence; reduced consumer spending levels resulting from tax increases or other factors; prolonged high unemployment rates; higher commodity and component costs; fuel prices; inflationary or deflationary pressures; reduced credit availability or unfavorable credit terms for dealers and end-user customers; higher short-term interest rates; and general economic and political conditions and expectations. Specific factors affecting the RV industry include:\n\u2022\noverall consumer confidence and the level of discretionary consumer spending;\n\u2022\nemployment trends;\n\u2022\nthe adverse impact of global tensions on consumer spending and travel-related activities; and\n\u2022\nthe adverse impact on margins due to increases in raw material costs which we are unable to pass on to customers without negatively affecting sales.\nDependence on Credit Availability and Interest Rates to Dealers and Retail Purchasers\nOur business is affected by the availability and terms of the financing to dealers. Generally, RV dealers finance their purchases of inventory with financing provided by lending institutions. Three financial flooring institutions held 61% of our total financed dealer inventory dollars that were outstanding at August 27, 2016. In the event that any of these lending institutions limit or discontinue dealer financing, we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business is also affected by the availability and terms of financing to retail purchasers. Retail buyers purchasing a motorhome or towable may elect to finance their purchase through the dealership or a financial institution of their choice. Substantial increases in interest rates or decreases in the general availability of credit for our dealers or for the retail purchaser may have an adverse impact upon our business and results of operations.\nCyclicality and Seasonality\nThe RV industry has been characterized by cycles of growth and contraction in consumer demand, reflecting prevailing economic and demographic conditions, which affect disposable income for leisure-time activities. Consequently, the results for any prior period may not be indicative of results for any future period.\nSeasonal factors, over which we have no control, also have an effect on the demand for our products. Demand in the RV industry generally declines over the winter season, while sales are generally highest during the spring and summer months. Also, unusually severe weather conditions in some markets may impact demand. Our business also does well when the US housing market is strong and our business weakens when the US housing market weakens.\nManaging Growth Opportunities\nOne of our growth strategies is to drive growth through targeted acquisitions and alliances, stronger customer relations, and new joint ventures and partnerships that add value while supplementing our existing brands and product portfolio. Our ability to grow through acquisitions will depend, in part, on the availability of suitable candidates at acceptable prices, terms, and conditions, our ability to compete effectively for acquisition candidates, and the availability of capital and personnel to complete such acquisitions and run the acquired business effectively. Any acquisition, alliance, joint venture, or partnership could impair our business, financial condition, reputation, and operating results. The benefits of an acquisition or new alliance, joint venture, or partnership may take more time than expected to develop or integrate into our operations, and we cannot guarantee that previous or future acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures, or partnerships will, in fact, produce any benefits. Such acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures, and partnerships may involve a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u2022\ndisruption to our existing operations and plans;\n\u2022\ninability to effectively manage our expanded operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties or delays in integrating and assimilating information and financial systems, operations, and products of an acquired business or other business venture or in realizing projected efficiencies, growth prospects, cost savings, and synergies;\n\u2022\ninability to successfully integrate or develop a distribution channel for acquired product lines;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, or dealers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers, customers, distributors, and dealers;\n\u2022\nadverse impact on overall profitability if our expanded operations do not achieve the financial results projected in our valuation model;\n\u2022\ninaccurate assessment of additional post-acquisition or business venture investments, undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems, unanticipated costs associated with an acquisition or other business venture, and an inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs; and\n\u2022\nincorrect estimates made in the accounting for acquisitions, incurrence of non-recurring charges, and write-off of significant amounts of goodwill or other assets that could adversely affect our operating results.\nCredit Arrangements and Leverage\nIn order to achieve our growth strategies, we plan to establish new credit arrangements and increase our leverage. This capital will allow us to finance targeted acquisitions including the recently announced agreement to acquire Grand Design, as well as fund the working capital requirements of organic growth. In connection with our agreement to acquire Grand Design we executed a customary debt commitment letter with JPMorgan pursuant to which, subject to customary exceptions and conditions, JPMorgan has committed to provide a seven-year $300 million secured term loan B facility, and a five-year $125 million asset-based revolving credit facility (collectively the \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d). We intend to use the proceeds from the term loan and a portion of the revolving credit facility together with $60 million in cash and issue $105 million of common stock to complete the acquisition. The remainder of the revolving credit facility will be used to fund our working capital needs. The Credit Facilities are expected to be secured by all or substantially all of our assets, and will replace our current credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\nIf we cannot negotiate favorable agreements and related covenants, restrictive provisions may limit our ability to conduct our business, take advantage of business opportunities, and respond to changing business, market, and economic conditions. We must generate sufficient cash to pay our debt service and support our business in an industry that is cyclical. In addition, they may place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies that may be subject to fewer, if any, restrictions or may otherwise adversely affect our business. Transactions that we may view as important opportunities, such as significant acquisitions, may be subject to the consent of the lenders under future credit arrangements, which consent may be withheld or granted subject to conditions specified at the time that may affect the attractiveness or viability of the transaction.\nDemand Forecasting and Inventory Management\nOur ability to manage our inventory levels to meet our customer's demand for our products is important for our business. For example, certain dealers are focused on the rental market which spikes over the summer vacation period while other dealers are focused on direct sales to the consumer at various price points. Our production levels and inventory management are based on\ndemand estimates six to twelve months forward taking into account supply lead times, production capacity, timing of shipments, and dealer inventory levels. If we overestimate or underestimate demand for any of our products during a given season, we may not maintain appropriate inventory levels, which could negatively impact our net sales or working capital, hinder our ability to meet customer demand, or cause us to incur excess and obsolete inventory charges.\nDistribution Channel Management\nWe sell many of our products through distribution channels and are subject to risks relating to their inventory management decisions and operational and sourcing practices. Our distribution channel customers carry inventories of our products as part of their ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs. Such adjustments may impact our inventory management and working capital goals as well as operating results. If the inventory levels of our distribution channel customers are higher than they desire, they may postpone product purchases from us, which could cause our sales to be lower than the end-user demand for our products and negatively impact our inventory management and working capital goals as well as our operating results.\nResponsiveness to Market Changes\nOne of our growth strategies is to develop innovative, customer-valued products to generate revenue growth. We may not be able to compete as effectively with our competitors, and ultimately satisfy the needs and preferences of our customers, unless we can continue to enhance existing products and develop new innovative products for the markets in which we compete. Product development requires significant financial, technological, and other resources. Product improvements and new product introductions also require significant research, planning, design, development, engineering, and testing at the technological, product, and manufacturing process levels and we may not be able to timely develop and introduce product improvements or new products. Our competitors' new products may beat our products to market, be higher quality or more reliable, be more effective with more features and/or less expensive than our products, obtain better market acceptance, or render our products obsolete. Any new products that we develop may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful net sales or profits for us relative to our expectations based on, among other things, existing and anticipated investments in manufacturing capacity and commitments to fund advertising, marketing, promotional programs, and research and development.\nPotential Loss of a Large Dealer Organization\nOne of our dealer organizations accounted for 16.6% of our net revenue for Fiscal 2016. A second dealer organization, accounted for 13.0% of our net revenue for Fiscal 2016. The loss of either or both of these dealer organizations could have a significant adverse effect on our business. In addition, deterioration in the liquidity or creditworthiness of either or both of these dealers could negatively impact our sales and could trigger repurchase obligations under our repurchase agreements.\nPotential Repurchase Liabilities\nIn accordance with customary practice in the RV industry, upon request we enter into formal repurchase agreements with lending institutions financing a dealer's purchase of our products. In these repurchase agreements we agree, in the event of a default by an independent dealer in its obligation to a lender and repossession of the unit(s) by the lending institution, to repurchase units at declining prices over the term of the agreements, which can last up to 18 months. The difference between the gross repurchase price and the price at which the repurchased product can then be resold, which is typically at a discount to the gross repurchase price, represents a potential expense to us. In certain instances, we also repurchase inventory from our dealers due to state law or regulatory requirements that govern voluntary or involuntary terminations. If we are obligated to repurchase a substantially larger number of RVs in the future, this would increase our costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nFuel Availability and Price Volatility\nGasoline or diesel fuel is required for the operation of motorized RVs. There can be no assurance that the supply of these petroleum products will continue uninterrupted or that the price or tax on these petroleum products will not significantly increase in the future. RVs, however, are not generally purchased for fuel efficiency. Fuel shortages and substantial increases in fuel prices have had a material adverse effect on the RV industry as a whole in the past and could have a material adverse effect on us in the future.\nDependence on Suppliers\nMost of our RV components are readily available from numerous sources. However, a few of our components are produced by a small group of suppliers. In the case of motorhome chassis, Ford Motor Company, Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation, Mercedes-Benz (USA and Canada) and FCA (US and Canada) are our major suppliers. Our relationship with our chassis suppliers is similar to our other supplier relationships in that no special contractual commitments are engaged in by either party. This means that we do not have minimum purchase requirements and our chassis suppliers do not have minimum supply requirements. Our chassis suppliers also supply to our competitors. Historically, chassis suppliers resort to an industry-wide allocation system during periods when supply is restricted. These allocations have been based on the volume of chassis previously purchased. Sales of motorhomes rely on chassis supply and are affected by shortages from time to time. Decisions by our suppliers to decrease production, production delays, or work stoppages by the employees of such suppliers, or price increases could have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce motorhomes and ultimately, on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nRaw Material Costs\nWe purchase raw materials such as steel, aluminum, and other commodities, and components, such as chassis, refrigerators, and televisions, for use in our products. In addition, we are a purchaser of components and parts containing various commodities,\nincluding steel, aluminum, copper, lead, rubber, and others that are integrated into our end products. To the extent that commodity prices increase and we do not have firm pricing from our suppliers, or our suppliers are not able to honor such prices, increases in the cost of such raw materials and components and parts may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along to our customers these cost increases in the form of price increases or otherwise reduce our cost of goods sold. In addition, increases in other costs of doing business may also adversely affect our profit margins and businesses. For example, an increase in fuel costs may result in an increase in our transportation costs, which also could adversely affect our operating results and businesses. Historically, we have mitigated cost increases, in part, by collaborating with suppliers, reviewing alternative sourcing options, substituting materials, engaging in internal cost reduction efforts, and increasing prices on some of our products, all as appropriate. However, we may not be able to fully offset such increased costs in the future. Further, if our price increases are not accepted by our customers and the market, our net sales, profit margins, earnings, and market share could be adversely affected.\nWarranty Claims\nWe receive warranty claims from our dealers in the ordinary course of our business. Although we maintain reserves for such claims, which to date have been adequate, there can be no assurance that warranty expense levels will remain at current levels or that such reserves will continue to be adequate. A significant increase in warranty claims exceeding our current warranty expense levels could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition to the costs associated with the contractual warranty coverage provided on our products, we also occasionally incur costs as a result of additional service actions not covered by our warranties, including product recalls and customer satisfaction actions. Although we estimate and reserve for the cost of these service actions, there can be no assurance that expense levels will remain at current levels or such reserves will continue to be adequate.\nProtection of our Brand\nWe believe that one of the strengths of our business is our brand which is widely known around the world. We vigorously defend our brand and our other intellectual property rights against third parties on a global basis. We have, from time to time, had to bring claims against third parties to protect or prevent unauthorized use of our brand. If we are unable to protect and defend our brand or other intellectual property, it could have a material adverse effect on our results or financial condition.\nProduct Liability\nWe are subject, in the ordinary course of business, to litigation including a variety of warranty, \"Lemon Law\" and product liability claims typical in the RV industry. Although we have an insurance policy with a $35.0 million limit covering product liability, we are self-insured for the first $2.5 million of product liability claims on a per occurrence basis, with a $6.0 million aggregate per policy year. We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future claims against us, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Any increase in the frequency and size of these claims, as compared to our experience in prior years, may cause the premium that we are required to pay for insurance to rise significantly. Product liability claims may also cause us to pay punitive damages, not all of which are covered by our insurance. In addition, if product liability claims rise to a level of frequency or size that are significantly higher than similar claims made against our competitors, our reputation and business may be harmed.\nInformation Systems and Web Applications\nWe rely on our information systems and web applications to support our business operations, including but not limited to procurement, supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, warranty administration, invoicing and collection of payments. We use information systems to report and audit our operational results. Additionally, we rely upon information systems in our sales, marketing, human resources and communication efforts. Due to our reliance on our information systems, our business processes may be negatively impacted in the event of substantial disruption of service. Further, misuse, leakage or falsification of information could result in a violation of privacy laws and damage our reputation which could, in turn, have a negative impact on our results.\nIn addition to our general reliance on information systems, we began implementation of a new ERP system at the end of fiscal year 2015. The implementation has been staged in several subprojects and many have been completed. The final phases of the project relate to motorhome products and are planned for late Fiscal 2017. Though we perform planning and testing to reduce risks associated with such a complex, enterprise-wide systems change, failure to meet requirements of the business could disrupt our business and harm our reputation, which may result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess or obsolete inventory, and product shortages, causing our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results to suffer.\nData Security\nWe have security systems in place with the intent of maintaining the physical security of our facilities and protecting our customers', clients' and suppliers' confidential information and information related to identifiable individuals against unauthorized access through our information systems or by other electronic transmission or through the misdirection, theft or loss of physical media. These include, for example, the appropriate encryption of information. Despite such efforts, we are subject to breach of security systems which may result in unauthorized access to our facilities or the information we are trying to protect. Because the technologies used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly changing and becoming increasingly more sophisticated and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement sufficient preventative measures. If unauthorized parties gain physical access to one of our facilities or electronic access to our information systems or such information is misdirected, lost or stolen during transmission or transport, any theft or misuse of such information could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, difficulty in marketing our services, allegations by our customers and clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties and\npossible financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations and the following summarizes some, but not all, of the laws and regulations that apply to us.\nFederal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards govern the design, manufacture and sale of our products, which standards are promulgated by the National Highway Safety Administration (NHTSA). NHTSA requires manufacturers to recall and repair vehicles which are non-compliant with a Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard or contain safety defects. Any major recalls of our vehicles, voluntary or involuntary, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. While we believe we are substantially in compliance with the foregoing laws and regulations as they currently exist, amendments to any of these regulations or the implementation of new regulations could significantly increase the cost of testing, manufacturing, purchasing, operating or selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, our failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in Federal fines being imposed on us, potential civil and criminal liability, suspension of sales or production or cessation of operations\nWe are also subject to federal and numerous state consumer protection and unfair trade practice laws and regulations relating to the sale, transportation and marketing of motor vehicles, including so-called \"Lemon Laws.\" Federal and state laws and regulations also impose upon vehicle operators various restrictions on the weight, length and width of motor vehicles, including motorhomes that may be operated in certain jurisdictions or on certain roadways. Certain jurisdictions also prohibit the sale of vehicles exceeding length restrictions.\nFailure to comply with NYSE and SEC laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our business. Additionally, amendments to these regulations and the implementation of new regulations could increase the cost of manufacturing, purchasing, operating or selling our products and therefore could have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe SEC adopted rules pursuant to Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act setting forth new disclosure requirements concerning the use or potential use of certain minerals, deemed conflict minerals (tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten), that are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. These requirements necessitate due diligence efforts on our part to assess whether such minerals are used in our products in order to make the relevant required disclosures that began in May 2014. We incurred costs and diverted internal resource to comply with these new disclosure requirements, including for diligence to determine the sources of those minerals that may be used or necessary to the production of our products. Compliance costs may increase in future periods. We may face reputational challenges that could impact future sales if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products.\nFinally, federal and state authorities also have various environmental control standards relating to air, water, noise pollution and hazardous waste generation and disposal which affect us and our operations. Failure by us to comply with present or future laws and regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, potential civil and criminal liability, suspension of production or operations, alterations to the manufacturing process, or costly cleanup or capital expenditures, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nClimate Change and Related Regulation\nThere is growing concern from members of the scientific community and the general public that an increase in global average temperatures due to emissions of greenhouse gases (\"GHG\") and other human activities have or will cause significant changes in weather patterns and increase the frequency and severity of natural disasters. We are currently subject to rules limiting emissions and other climate related rules and regulations in certain jurisdictions where we operate. In addition, we may become subject to additional legislation and regulation regarding climate change, and compliance with any new rules could be difficult and costly. Concerned parties, such as legislators, regulators, and non-governmental organizations, are considering ways to reduce GHG emissions. Foreign, federal, state, and local regulatory and legislative bodies have proposed various legislative and regulatory measures relating to climate change, regulating GHG emissions, and energy policies. If such legislation is enacted, we could incur increased energy, environmental, and other costs and capital expenditures to comply with the limitations. Due to uncertainty in the regulatory and legislative processes, as well as the scope of such requirements and initiatives, we cannot currently determine the effect such legislation and regulation may have on our products and operations.\nAnti-takeover Effect\nProvisions of our articles of incorporation, by-laws, the Iowa Business Corporation Act and provisions in our credit facilities and certain of our compensation programs that we may enter into from time to time could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial by our shareholders. As part of our acquisition of Grand Design, we will issue $105 million of common stock to the owners of Grand Design. As part of the transaction, the owners have agreed to standstill covenants that prohibit these parties from taking certain hostile actions against us for up to one year. The combination of these provisions effectively inhibits a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 51086, "SIC": 3790, "TIC": "WGO"}
