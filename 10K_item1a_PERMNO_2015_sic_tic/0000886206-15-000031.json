{"cik": "886206", "company": "FRANKLIN COVEY CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-11-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business environment, current domestic and international economic conditions, and other specific risks may affect our future business decisions and financial performance. The matters discussed below may cause our future results to differ from past results or those described in forward-looking statements and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and stock price, and should be considered in evaluating our Company.\nThe risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may include additional risk factors which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing global environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.\nInvestors should also be aware that while Franklin Covey does, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against our policy to disclose to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that the Company agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report. Furthermore, we do not confirm financial forecasts or projections issued by others. Thus, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts, or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of Franklin Covey Co.\nWe operate in an intensely competitive industry and our competitors may develop courses that adversely affect our ability to sell our offerings.\nThe training and consulting services industry is intensely competitive with relatively easy entry. Competitors continually introduce new programs and services that may compete directly with our offerings or that may make our offerings uncompetitive or obsolete. Larger competitors may have superior abilities to compete for clients and skilled professionals, reducing our ability to deliver quality work to our clients. In addition, one or more of our competitors may develop and implement training courses or methodologies that may adversely affect our ability to sell our curriculums and products to new clients. Any one of these circumstances could have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain new business and successfully deliver our services.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients\u2019 businesses and their levels of business activity.\nGlobal economic and political conditions affect our clients\u2019 businesses and the markets in which they operate. Our financial results are somewhat dependent on the amount that current and prospective clients budget for training. A serious and/or prolonged economic downturn (or drawn-out recovery) combined with a negative or uncertain political climate could adversely affect our clients\u2019 financial condition and the amount budgeted for training by our clients. These conditions may reduce the demand for our services or depress the pricing of those services and have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Changes in global economic conditions may also shift demand to services for which we do not have competitive advantages, and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain. Such economic, political, and client spending conditions are influenced by a\nwide range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting. If we are unable to successfully anticipate these changing conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, and our business could be adversely affected.\nOur business success also depends in part upon continued growth in the use of training and consulting services and the renewal of existing contracts by our clients. In challenging economic environments, our clients may reduce or defer their spending on new services and consulting solutions in order to focus on other priorities. At the same time, many companies have already invested substantial resources in their current means of conducting their business and they may be reluctant or slow to adopt new approaches that could disrupt existing personnel and/or processes. If growth in the general use of training and consulting services in business or our clients\u2019 spending on these items declines, or if we cannot convince our clients or potential clients to embrace new services and solutions, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, our business tends to lag behind economic cycles and, consequently, the benefits of an economic recovery following a period of economic downturn may take longer for us to realize than other segments of the economy.\nOur results of operations may be negatively affected if we cannot expand and develop our services and solutions in response to client demand or if newly developed or acquired services have increased costs.\nOur success depends upon our ability to develop and deliver services and solutions that respond to rapid and continuing changes in client needs. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely basis, and our offerings may not be successful in the marketplace. The implementation, acquisition, and introduction of new programs and solutions may reduce sales of our other existing programs and services and may entail more risk than supplying existing offerings to our clients. Newly developed or acquired solutions may also require increased royalty payments or carry significant development costs that must be expensed. Any one of these circumstances may have an adverse impact upon our business and results of operations.\nOur results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected if FC Organizational Products LLC is unable to pay the working capital settlement, reimbursable acquisition costs, or reimbursable operating expenses.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we sold our planning products operations to FC Organizational Products, LLC (FCOP), an entity in which we own a 19.5 percent interest. According to the agreements associated with the sale, we were entitled to receive a $1.2 million payment for working capital delivered on the closing date of the sale and to receive $2.3 million as reimbursement for specified costs necessary to complete the transaction. Payment for these costs was originally due in January 2009, but we extended the due date of the payment at FCOP\u2019s request and obtained a promissory note from FCOP for the amount owed, plus accrued interest. At the time we received the promissory note from FCOP, we believed that we could obtain payment for the amounts owed, based on prior year performance and forecasted financial performance in 2009. However, the financial position of FCOP deteriorated significantly late in fiscal 2009 and the deterioration accelerated subsequent to August 31, 2009. As a result of its deteriorating financial position, we reassessed the collectability of the promissory note. Based on revised expected cash flows and other operational issues, we recorded a $3.6 million impaired asset charge against these receivables in fiscal 2009.\nWe also receive reimbursement from FCOP for certain operating costs, such as rent, and, although not required by governing documents or our ownership interest, we have provided working capital and other advances to FCOP. At August 31, 2015 and 2014 we had $4.0 million and $5.1 million receivable from FCOP, net of discount, which are recorded as assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Although we believe that we will obtain payment from FCOP for these receivables, the valuation of amounts receivable from FCOP is dependent upon the estimated future earnings and cash flows of FCOP. If FCOP\u2019s estimated future earnings and cash flows decline, or if FCOP fails to pay amounts receivable and we fail to obtain payment on the previously impaired promissory note, our future cash flows and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur work with governmental clients exposes us to additional risks that are inherent in the government contracting process.\nOur clients include national, provincial, state, and local governmental entities, and our work with these governmental entities has various risks inherent in the governmental contracting process. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nGovernmental entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies. While these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, the governmental entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of, or terminate, these projects for lack of approved funding and other discretionary reasons. Changes in governmental priorities or other political developments, including disruptions in governmental operations, could result in changes in the scope of, or in termination of, our existing contracts.\n\u00b7\nGovernmental entities often reserve the right to audit our contract costs, including allocated indirect costs, and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices with respect to our government contracts. If the governmental entity finds that the costs are not reimbursable, then we will not be allowed to bill for those costs or the cost must be refunded to the client if it has already been paid to us. Findings from an audit also may result in our being required to prospectively adjust previously agreed upon rates for our work, which may affect our future margins.\n\u00b7\nIf a governmental client discovers improper activities in the course of audits or investigations, we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government. The inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities, regardless of their adequacy.\n\u00b7\nPolitical and economic factors such as pending elections, the outcome of recent elections, revisions to governmental tax policies, sequestration, debt ceiling negotiations, and reduced tax revenues can affect the number and terms of new governmental contracts signed.\nThe occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular governmental agency involved, but also our business with other agencies of the same or other governmental entities. Additionally, because of their visibility and political\nnature, governmental contracts may present a heightened risk to our reputation. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business or our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to attract, retain, and motivate high-quality employees, including training consultants and other key training representatives, we may not be able to grow our business as projected or may not be able to compete effectively.\nOur success and ability to grow are dependent, in part, on our ability to hire, retain, and motivate sufficient numbers of talented people with the increasingly diverse skills needed to serve our clients and grow our business. Competition for skilled personnel is intense at all levels of experience and seniority. There is a risk that we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds we require, or that it will prove difficult to retain them in a competitive labor market. If we are unable to hire and retain talented sales and delivery employees with the skills, and in the locations, we require, we might not be able to grow our business at projected levels or may not be able to effectively deliver our content and services. If we need to hire additional personnel to maintain a specified number of sales personnel or are required to re-assign personnel from other geographic areas, it could increase our costs and adversely affect our profit margins. In addition, the inability of newly hired sales personnel to achieve projected sales levels may inhibit our ability to attain anticipated growth.\nIn order to retain key personnel, we continue to offer a variable component of compensation, the payment of which is dependent upon our sales performance and profitability. We adjust our compensation levels and have adopted different methods of compensation in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of employees with the necessary skills to serve our clients and grow our business. We may also use share-based performance incentives as a component of our executives\u2019 compensation, which may affect amounts of cash compensation. Variations in any of these areas of compensation may adversely impact our operating performance.\nOur global operations pose complex management, foreign currency, legal, tax, and economic risks, which we may not adequately address.\nWe have sales offices in Australia, Japan, and the United Kingdom. We also have licensed operations in numerous other foreign countries. As a result of these foreign operations and their impact upon our financial statements, we are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7\nRestrictions on the movement of cash\n\u00b7\nBurdens of complying with a wide variety of national and local laws\n\u00b7\nThe absence in some jurisdictions of effective laws to protect our intellectual property rights\n\u00b7\nPolitical instability\n\u00b7\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations\n\u00b7\nLonger payment cycles\n\u00b7\nPrice controls or restrictions on exchange of foreign currencies\nWe may experience foreign currency gains and losses.\nOur sales outside of the United States totaled $47.3 million, or approximately 23 percent of consolidated sales, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015. If our international operations grow and become a larger component of our overall financial results, our revenues and operating results may be adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies (as happened in fiscal 2015) and may be favorably affected\nwhen the dollar weakens. In order to manage a portion of our foreign currency risk, we may make limited use of foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge certain transactions and translation exposure. However, there can be no guarantee that our foreign currency risk management strategy will be effective in reducing the risks associated with foreign currency transactions and translation.\nOur global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violation of these regulations could harm our business.\nBecause we provide services to clients in many countries, we are subject to numerous, and sometimes conflicting, regulations on matters as diverse as import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, government affairs, internal and disclosure control obligations, data privacy, and labor relations. Violations of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business, and damage to our reputation. Violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for monetary damages, fines, unfavorable publicity, and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations. Due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate, local laws may be insufficient to protect our rights.\nIn many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate, practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits giving anything of value intended to influence the awarding of government contracts. Although we have policies and procedures to ensure legal and regulatory compliance, our employees, licensee operators, and agents could take actions that violate these requirements. Violations of these regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions, including fines and suspension or disqualification from United States federal procurement contracting, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe could have liability or our reputation could be damaged if we do not protect client data or if our information systems are breached.\nWe are dependent on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information and to communicate between our locations around the world and with our clients. Security breaches of this infrastructure could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. We are also required at times to manage, utilize, and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data. As a result, we are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as the various U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of individually identifiable information. If any person, including any of our associates, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to monetary damages, fines, and/or criminal prosecution. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud, or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients.\nIn addition, we have in the past relied on adherence to the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Safe Harbor Policy Principles and compliance with the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks as agreed to and set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the European Union, and Switzerland, which established a means for legitimating the transfer of\npersonally identifiable information by U.S. companies doing business in Europe from the European Economic Area to the U.S. As a result of the October 6, 2015 European Union Court of Justice (ECJ) opinion in Case C-362/14 (Schrems v. Data Protection Commissioner), the U.S.-EU Framework is no longer deemed to be an adequate method of compliance with restrictions set forth in the Data Protection Directive (and member states\u2019 implementations thereof) regarding the transfer of data outside of the European Economic Area. In light of the ECJ opinion in case C-362/14, we may need to engage in additional efforts to legitimize certain data transfers from the European Economic Area. We may be unsuccessful in establishing legitimate means of transferring certain data from the European Economic Area, and we may be at risk of enforcement actions taken by an EU data protection authority until such point in time that we ensure all data transfers to us from the European Economic Area are legitimized. We may find it necessary to establish systems to maintain EU-origin data in the European Economic Area, which may involve substantial expense and distraction from other aspects of our business. We publicly post our privacy policies and practices concerning our processing, use, and disclosure of personally identifiable information. The publication of our privacy policy and other statements we publish that provide assurances about privacy and security can subject us to potential federal, state, or other regulatory action if they are found to be deceptive or misrepresentative of our practices.\nWe may fail to meet analyst expectations, which could cause the price of our stock to decline.\nOur common stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These periodic reports include information about our historical financial results as well as the analysts\u2019 estimates of our future performance. The analysts\u2019 estimates are based on their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline. If our stock price is volatile, we may become involved in securities litigation following a decline in price. Any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.\nOur future quarterly operating results are subject to factors that can cause fluctuations in our stock price.\nHistorically, our stock price has experienced significant volatility. We expect that our stock price may continue to experience volatility in the future due to a variety of potential factors that may include the following:\n\u00b7\nFluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and cash flows\n\u00b7\nIncreased overall market volatility\n\u00b7\nVariations between our actual financial results and market expectations\n\u00b7\nChanges in our key balances, such as cash and cash equivalents\n\u00b7\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations\n\u00b7\nUnexpected asset impairment charges\n\u00b7\nIncreased or decreased analyst coverage\nThese factors may have an adverse effect upon our stock price in the future.\nThe sale of a large number of common shares by Knowledge Capital could depress the market price of our common stock.\nKnowledge Capital Investment Group (Knowledge Capital), a related party primarily controlled by a member of our Board of Directors, held a warrant to purchase 5.9 million shares of our common stock. Knowledge Capital exercised its warrant at various times on a net share basis and received 2.2 million shares of our common stock in addition to stock it already held. On January 26, 2015, the SEC declared effective a registration statement with the SEC on Form S-3 to register shares held by Knowledge Capital. On May 20, 2015, Knowledge Capital sold 400,000 shares of our common stock on the open market and we did not purchase any of these shares. Knowledge Capital currently holds 2.8 million shares, or approximately 17 percent, of our outstanding common shares. The sale or prospect of the sale of a substantial number of these shares may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nOur profitability will suffer if we are not able to maintain our pricing and utilization rates.\nThe profit margin on our services is largely a function of the rates we are able to recover for our services and the utilization, or chargeability, of our trainers, client partners, and consultants. Accordingly, if we are unable to maintain sufficient pricing for our services or an appropriate utilization rate for our training professionals without corresponding cost reductions, our profit margin and overall profitability will suffer. The rates that we are able to recover for our services are affected by a number of factors that we may be unable to control, including:\n\u00b7\nOur clients\u2019 perceptions of our ability to add value through our programs and content\n\u00b7\nCompetition\n\u00b7\nGeneral economic conditions\n\u00b7\nIntroduction of new programs or services by us or our competitors\n\u00b7\nOur ability to accurately estimate, attain, and sustain engagement sales, margins, and cash flows over longer contract periods\nOur utilization rates are also affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nSeasonal trends, primarily as a result of scheduled training\n\u00b7\nOur ability to forecast demand for our products and services and thereby maintain an appropriate headcount in our employee base\n\u00b7\nOur ability to manage attrition\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain favorable utilization rates in future periods. Additionally, we may not achieve a utilization rate that is optimal for us. If our utilization rate is too high, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition. If our utilization rate is too low, our profit margin and profitability may suffer.\nWe depend on key personnel, the loss of whom could harm our business.\nOur future success will depend, in part, on the continued service of key executive officers and personnel. The loss of the services of any key individuals could harm our business. Our future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract, and retain additional qualified senior personnel. Competition for such individuals in our industry is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.\nWe have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights, which are important to our success.\nOur financial success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary curriculums and other intellectual property. The existing laws of some countries in which we provide services might offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights. To protect our intellectual property, we rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, as well as patent, copyright, and trademark laws. The steps we take in this regard may not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property, and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights, especially in foreign jurisdictions.\nThe loss of proprietary content or the unauthorized use of our intellectual property may create greater competition, loss of revenue, adverse publicity, and may limit our ability to reuse that intellectual property for other clients. Any limitation on our ability to provide a service or solution could cause us to lose revenue-generating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future engagements.\nIf we are unable to collect our accounts receivable on a timely basis, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur business depends on our ability to successfully obtain timely payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for services performed. We evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles. However, as our sales to governmental entities, including school districts, continue to grow, our collection cycle may take longer due to procurement and payment procedures at these clients. We maintain allowances against our receivables and unbilled services that we believe are adequate to reserve for potentially uncollectible amounts. Actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and, as a result, we may need to adjust our allowances. In addition, there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients. Macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients, and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance, or not pay their obligations to us. Timely collection of client balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our invoiced revenues. If we are unable to meet our contractual requirements, we might experience delays in collection of and/or be unable to collect our client balances, and if this occurs, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s use of accounting estimates involves judgment and could impact our financial results.\nOur most critical accounting estimates are described in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis found in Item 7 of this report under the section entitled \u201cUse of Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies.\u201d In addition, as discussed in various footnotes to our financial statements as found in Item 8, we make certain estimates for loss contingencies, including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. Because, by definition, these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment, our actual financial results may differ from these estimates.\nWe have significant intangible assets, goodwill, and long-term asset balances that may be impaired if cash flows from related activities decline.\nAt August 31, 2015 we had $53.4 million of intangible assets, which were primarily generated from the fiscal 1997 merger with the Covey Leadership Center, and $19.9 million of goodwill. Our intangible assets are evaluated for impairment based on qualitative factors or upon cash flows (definite-lived intangible assets) and estimated royalties from revenue streams (indefinite-lived intangible assets) if necessary. Our goodwill is evaluated through qualitative factors and by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value of our net assets if necessary. Our intangible assets, goodwill, and other long-term assets may become impaired if the corresponding cash flows associated with these assets declines in future periods or if our market capitalization declines significantly in future periods. Although our current sales, cash flows, and market capitalization are sufficient to support the carrying basis of these long-lived assets, if our sales, cash flows, or common stock price decline, we may be faced with significant asset impairment charges that would have an adverse impact upon our results of operations.\nFailure to comply with the terms and conditions of our credit facility may have an adverse effect upon our business and operations.\nOur line of credit facility requires us to be in compliance with customary non-financial terms and conditions as well as specified financial ratios. Failure to comply with these terms and conditions or maintain adequate financial performance to comply with specific financial ratios entitles the lender to certain remedies, including the right to immediately call due any amounts outstanding on the line of credit. Such events would have an adverse effect upon our business and operations as there can be no assurance that we may be able to obtain other forms of financing or raise additional capital on terms that would be acceptable to us.\nWe may need additional capital in the future, and this capital may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all.\nWe may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt offerings or equity financings in order to:\n\u00b7\nDevelop new services, programs, or offerings\n\u00b7\nTake advantage of opportunities, including expansion of the business\n\u00b7\nRespond to competitive pressures\nGoing forward, we will continue to incur costs necessary for the day-to-day operation and potential growth of the business and may use our available revolving line of credit facility and other financing alternatives, if necessary, for these expenditures. Our existing lending arrangement expires on March 31, 2018 and we expect to regularly renew our lending agreement to maintain the availability of this credit facility. Additional potential sources of liquidity available to us include factoring receivables, issuance of additional equity, or issuance of debt from public or private sources. If necessary, we will evaluate all of these options and select one or more of them depending on overall capital needs and the associated cost of capital.\nAny additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute current shareholders\u2019 ownership percentage in us. Furthermore, we may be unable to obtain the necessary capital on terms or conditions that are favorable to us, or at all.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nAs a multinational company, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes in both the United States and various foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. In the normal course of a global business, there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, we are routinely subject to audits by various taxing authorities. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the final determination of these tax audits will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\nWe are also subject to non-income taxes such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, and property taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We are routinely audited by tax authorities with respect to these non-income taxes and may have exposure from additional non-income tax liabilities.\nInternational hostilities, terrorist activities, and natural disasters may prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus adversely affect our operating results.\nActs of terrorist violence, armed regional and international hostilities, and international responses to these hostilities, natural disasters, global health risks or pandemics, or the threat of or perceived potential for these events, could have a negative impact on our directly owned or licensee operations. These events could adversely affect our clients\u2019 levels of business activity and precipitate sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles. These events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world, whether the facilities are ours or those of our alliance partners or clients. By disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel, these events could make it difficult or impossible for us or our licensee partners to deliver services to clients. Extended disruptions of electricity, other public utilities, or network services at our facilities, as well as system failures at, or security breaches in, our facilities or systems, could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients. While we plan and prepare to defend against each of these occurrences, we might be unable to protect our people, facilities, and systems against all such occurrences. In addition, our information systems\u2019 disaster recovery plan may be insufficient to maintain our business at acceptable levels. We generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks, conflicts, and wars. If these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients or maintaining our other operations, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nIneffective internal controls could impact our business and operating results.\nOur internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results may be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.", "PERMNO": 77637, "SIC": 8200, "TIC": "FC"}
