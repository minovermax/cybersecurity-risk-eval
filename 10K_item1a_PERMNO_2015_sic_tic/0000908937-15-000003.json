{"cik": "908937", "company": "SIRIUS XM HOLDINGS INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-05", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the information under the caption Item 1. Business \u201cCompetition,\u201d the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us and our business. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d following this Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe face substantial competition and that competition is likely to increase over time.\nWe face substantial competition from other providers of radio and other audio services. Our ability to retain and attract subscribers depends on our success in creating and providing popular or unique music, entertainment, news and sports programming. Our subscribers can obtain certain similar content for free through terrestrial radio stations or Internet radio services. Audio content delivered via the Internet, including through mobile devices in vehicles, is increasingly competitive with our services. A summary of various services that compete with us is contained in the section entitled \u201cItem 1. Business-Competition\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCompetition could result in lower subscription, advertising or other revenue or an increase in our marketing, promotion or other expenses and, consequently, lower our earnings and free cash flow. We cannot assure you we will be able to compete successfully with our existing or future competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ability to attract and retain subscribers in the future is uncertain.\nOur ability to retain our subscribers, or increase the number of subscribers to our service, is uncertain and subject to many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe production and sale or lease of new vehicles in the United States;\n\u2022\nthe price of our service;\n\u2022\nthe health of the economy;\n\u2022\nthe rate at which existing self-pay subscribers buy and sell new and used vehicles in the United States;\n\u2022\nour ability to convince owners and lessees of new and previously owned vehicles that include satellite radios to purchase subscriptions to our service;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our marketing programs;\n\u2022\nthe entertainment value of our programming; and\n\u2022\nactions by our competitors, such as terrestrial radio and other audio entertainment and information providers.\nAs part of our business, we experience, and expect to experience in the future, subscriber turnover (i.e., churn). Some elements of our business strategy may result in churn increasing. For example, our efforts to increase the penetration of satellite radios in new, lower priced vehicle lines may result in the growth of economy-minded subscribers; our work to acquire subscribers purchasing or leasing pre-owned vehicles may attract subscribers of more limited economic means; and our product and marketing efforts may attract more price sensitive subscribers.\nIf we are unable to retain current subscribers at expected rates, or the costs of retaining subscribers are higher than expected, our financial performance and operating results could be adversely affected. We cannot predict how successful we will be at retaining customers who purchase or lease vehicles that include a subscription to our satellite radio service. We spend substantial amounts on advertising and marketing and in transactions with automakers, retailers and others to obtain and attract subscribers.\nAverage monthly revenue per subscriber, which we refer to as ARPU, is a key metric we use to analyze our business. Over the past several years, we have focused substantial attention and efforts on balancing ARPU and subscriber additions. Our ability to increase or maintain ARPU over time is uncertain and depends upon various factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe value consumers perceive in our service;\n\u2022\nour ability to add and retain compelling programming;\n\u2022\nthe increasing competition we experience from terrestrial and Internet radio and other audio entertainment and information providers;\n\u2022\nour ability to increase prices; and\n\u2022\ndiscounted offers we may make to attract new subscribers and retain existing subscribers.\nOur profitability could be adversely affected if we are unable to consistently attract new subscribers and retain our current subscribers at prices and margins consistent with our past performance.\nOur business depends in large part upon the auto industry.\nA substantial portion of our subscription growth has come from purchasers and lessees of new and previously owned automobiles in the United States. The sale and lease of vehicles with satellite radios is an important source of subscribers for our satellite radio service. We have agreements with every major automaker to include satellite radios in new vehicles, although these agreements do not require automakers to install specific or minimum quantities of radios in any given period.\nAutomotive production and sales are dependent on many factors, including the availability of consumer credit, general economic conditions, consumer confidence and fuel costs. To the extent vehicle sales by automakers decline, or the penetration of factory-installed satellite radios in those vehicles is reduced, subscriber growth for our satellite radio services may be adversely impacted.\nSales of previously owned vehicles represent a significant source of new subscribers for us. We have agreements with various auto dealers and companies operating in the used vehicle market to provide us with data on sales of previously owned satellite radio enabled vehicles. The continuing availability of this information is important to our future growth.\nGeneral economic conditions can affect our business.\nThe purchase of a satellite radio subscription is discretionary, and our business and our financial condition can be negatively affected by general economic conditions. Poor general economic conditions could adversely affect subscriber churn, conversion rates and vehicle sales.\nConsumer protection laws and their enforcement could damage our business.\nWe engage in extensive marketing efforts to attract and retain subscribers to our services. We employ a wide variety of communications tools as part of our marketing campaigns, including telemarketing efforts; print, television, radio and online advertising; direct mail; and email solicitations.\nConsumer protection laws, rules and regulations are extensive and have developed rapidly, particularly at the state level. Consumer protection laws in certain jurisdictions cover nearly all aspects of our marketing efforts, including the content of our advertising, the terms of consumer offers and the manner in which we communicate with subscribers and prospective subscribers. We are engaged in considerable efforts to ensure that all our activities comply with federal and state laws, rules and regulations relating to consumer protection, including laws relating to telemarketing activities and privacy. From time to time we are subject to certain claims under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act relating to telephone calls our vendors make to subscribers and trial subscribers, including calls to consumers' mobile phones. Modifications to federal and state laws, rules and regulations concerning consumer protection, including decisions by federal and state courts and agencies interpreting these laws, could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain subscribers to our services. While we monitor the changes in and interpretations of these laws in consumer-related settlements and decisions, and while we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that new laws or regulations will not be enacted or adopted, preexisting laws or regulations will not be more strictly enforced or that our varied operations will continue to comply with all applicable laws, which might adversely affect our operations.\nIf we fail to protect the security of personal information about our customers, we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and our reputation could suffer.\nThe nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of personal information about our subscribers including, in many cases, credit and debit card information. If we fail to protect the security of personal information about our customers or if we experience a data security breach, we could be exposed to costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and our reputation could suffer. In addition, our subscribers and potential customers could lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal information, which could cause them to discontinue usage of our services. Such events could lead to lost future sales and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOther existing or future government laws and regulations could harm our business.\nWe are subject to many other federal, state and local laws. These laws and regulations cover issues such as user privacy, behavioral advertising, automatic renewal of agreements, pricing, fraud, electronic waste, mobile and electronic device communications, quality of products and services, taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights and information security. The expansion of these laws, both in terms of their number and their applicability, could harm our business. Similarly, new disclosure and reporting requirements, established under existing or new state or federal laws could increase the cost of doing business, adversely affecting our results of operations.\nFailure of our satellites would significantly damage our business.\nThe lives of our satellites will vary depending on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\ndegradation and durability of solar panels;\n\u2022\nquality of construction;\n\u2022\nrandom failure of satellite components, which could result in significant damage to or loss of a satellite;\n\u2022\namount of fuel the satellite consumes; and\n\u2022\ndamage or destruction by electrostatic storms, collisions with other objects in space or other events, such as nuclear detonations, occurring in space.\nIn the ordinary course of operation, satellites experience failures of component parts and operational and performance anomalies. Components on our in-orbit satellites have failed; and from time to time we have experienced anomalies in the operation and performance of these satellites. These failures and anomalies are expected to continue in the ordinary course, and we cannot predict if any of these possible future events will have a material adverse effect on our operations or the life of our existing in-orbit satellites. Any material failure of our satellites could cause us to lose customers and could materially harm our reputation and our operating results. We hold no in-orbit insurance for our satellites other than our XM-5 satellite, which will expire in 2015. Additional information regarding our fleet of satellites is contained in the section entitled \u201cItem 1. Business - Satellites, Terrestrial Repeaters and Other Satellite Facilities\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, our Sirius network of terrestrial repeaters communicates with a single third-party satellite. Our XM network of terrestrial repeaters communicates with a single XM satellite. If the satellites communicating with the applicable repeater network fail unexpectedly, the services would be disrupted for several hours or longer.\nInterruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could negatively impact our results and our brand.\nWe operate a complex and growing business. We offer a wide variety of subscription packages at different price points. Our business is dependent on the operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems and those of certain third party service providers. Any degradation in the quality, or any failure, of our systems could reduce our revenues, cause us to lose customers and damage our brand. Although we have implemented practices designed to maintain the availability of our information technology systems and mitigate the harm of any unplanned interruptions, we cannot anticipate all eventualities. We occasionally experience unplanned outages or technical difficulties. We could also experience loss of data or processing capabilities, which could cause us to lose customers and could materially harm our reputation and our operating results.\nWe rely on internal systems and external systems maintained by manufacturers, distributors and service providers to take, fulfill and handle customer service requests and host certain online activities. Any interruption or failure of our internal or external systems could prevent us from servicing customers or cause data to be unintentionally disclosed.\nOur data centers and our information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, malicious attacks, fire, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses or other attempts to harm our systems.\nIf hackers were able to circumvent our security measures, we could lose proprietary information or personal information or experience significant disruptions. If our systems become unavailable or suffer a security breach, we may be required to expend significant resources to address these problems, including notification under various federal and state data privacy regulations, and our reputation and operating results could suffer.\nRoyalties for music rights have increased, there can be no assurance they will not continue to increase, and the market for music rights is changing and is subject to significant uncertainties.\nWe must maintain music programming royalty arrangements with, and pay license fees to, BMI, ASCAP and SESAC. These organizations traditionally negotiate with copyright users, collect royalties and distribute them to songwriters and music publishers. We have agreements with ASCAP, BMI and SESAC through 2016. There can be no assurance that the royalties we pay to ASCAP, SESAC, BMI and other songwriters and music publishers will not increase upon expiration of these arrangements.\nThe market for acquiring rights from songwriters and music publishers is changing. BMI and ASCAP are subject to Consent Decrees with the United States. The Unites States Department of Justice is reviewing these Consent Decrees and may agree to changes to those arrangements. In addition, certain songwriters and music publishers have purportedly withdrawn from two of the traditional performing rights organizations, ASCAP and BMI, and third parties have contacted us regarding the need to separately license works. The change to, and fragmentation of, the traditional market for licensing musical works could increase our licensing costs and/or cause us in certain cases to reduce the number of works we perform.\nUnder the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995 and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, we also must pay royalties to copyright owners of sound recordings fixed after February 15, 1972. Those royalty rates may be established through negotiation or, if negotiation is unsuccessful, by the CRB. Owners of copyrights in sound recordings have created SoundExchange, a collective organization, to collect and distribute royalties. SoundExchange is exempt by statute from certain U.S. antitrust laws and exercises significant market power in the licensing of sound recordings. Under the terms of the CRB's decision governing sound recording royalties for the five-year period ending on December 31, 2017, we will pay a royalty based on gross revenues, subject to certain exclusions, of 10.0% for 2015, 10.5% for 2016, and 11% for 2017.\nThe right to perform certain copyrighted sound recordings that were fixed before February 15, 1972 is governed by state common law principles and, in certain instances, may be subject to state statutes. We are a defendant in litigation in three States regarding the alleged distribution, duplication and performance of certain copyrighted sound recordings that were fixed before February 15, 1972. If courts ultimately hold that a performance right exists under state copyright laws, we may be required to pay additional royalties to perform copyrighted sound recordings that were fixed before February 15, 1972 or remove those works from our service.\nThe unfavorable outcome of pending or future litigation could have a material adverse effect.\nWe are parties to several legal proceedings arising out of various aspects of our business, including patent infringement suits, class action and individual suits seeking compensation for our use of sound recordings fixed prior to February 15, 1972 and class actions seeking damages for purported violations of the telephone consumer protection act. We are defending all claims against us. The outcome of these proceedings may not be favorable, and an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results. See \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings\" below.\nWe may not realize the benefits of acquisitions or other strategic initiatives.\nOur business strategy may include selective acquisitions or other strategic initiatives that allow us to expand our business. The success of any acquisition depends upon effective integration of acquired businesses and assets into our operations, which is subject to risks and uncertainties, including realization of any anticipated synergies and cost savings, the ability to retain and attract personnel, the diversion of management\u2019s attention for other business concerns, and undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of the acquired business or assets.\nRapid technological and industry changes could adversely impact our services.\nThe audio entertainment industry is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product innovations, changes in customer requirements and expectations, and evolving standards. If we are unable to keep pace with these changes, our business may not succeed. Products using new technologies, or emerging industry standards, could make our technologies less competitive in the marketplace.\nFailure of third parties to perform could adversely affect our business.\nOur business depends, in part, on various third parties, including:\n\u2022\nmanufacturers that build and distribute satellite radios;\n\u2022\ncompanies that manufacture and sell integrated circuits for satellite radios;\n\u2022\nprogramming providers and on-air talent;\n\u2022\nvendors that operate our call centers;\n\u2022\nretailers that market and sell satellite radios and promote subscriptions to our services; and\n\u2022\nvendors that have designed or built, and vendors that support or operate, other important elements of our systems.\nIf one or more of these third parties do not perform in a satisfactory or timely manner, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, a number of third parties on which we depend have experienced, and may in the future experience, financial difficulties or file for bankruptcy protection. Such third parties may not be able to perform their obligations to us in a timely manner, if at all, as a result of their financial condition or may be relieved of their obligations to us as part of seeking bankruptcy protection.\nWe design, establish specifications, source or specify parts and components, and manage various aspects of the logistics of the production of satellite radios. As a result of these activities, we may be exposed to liabilities associated with the design, manufacture and distribution of radios that the providers of an entertainment service would not customarily be subject to, such as liabilities for design defects, patent infringement and compliance with applicable laws, as well as the costs of returned product.\nFailure to comply with FCC requirements could damage our business.\nWe hold FCC licenses and authorizations to operate commercial satellite radio services in the United States, including authorizations for satellites and terrestrial repeaters, and related authorizations. The FCC generally grants licenses and authorizations for a fixed term. Although we expect our licenses and authorizations to be renewed in the ordinary course upon their expiration, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. Any assignment or transfer of control of any of our FCC licenses or authorizations must be approved in advance by the FCC.\nThe operation of our satellite radio systems is subject to significant regulation by the FCC under authority granted through the Communications Act of 1934 and related federal law. We are required, among other things, to operate only within specified frequencies; to meet certain conditions regarding the interoperability of our satellite radios with those of other licensed satellite radio systems; to coordinate our satellite radio services with radio systems operating in the same range of frequencies in neighboring countries; and to coordinate our communications links to our satellites with other systems that operate in the same frequency band. Noncompliance by us with these requirements or other conditions or with other applicable FCC rules and regulations could result in fines, additional license conditions, license revocation or other detrimental FCC actions. There is no guarantee that Congress will not modify the statutory framework governing our services, or that the FCC will not modify its rules and regulations in a manner that would have a material impact on our operations.\nWe also rely on the FCC to assist us in preventing harmful interference to our service. The development of new applications and services in spectrum adjacent to the frequencies licensed to us for satellite radio and ancillary services, as well as the possible distortion caused by the combination of signals in other frequencies, could cause harmful interference to our satellite radio service. Certain operations or combination of operations permitted by the FCC in spectrum, other than our licensed frequencies, could result in distortion to our service and the reception of our satellite radio service could be adversely affected in certain areas.\nThe terms of our licenses and the order of the FCC approving the Merger requires us to meet certain conditions. Non-compliance with these conditions could result in fines, additional license conditions, license revocation or other detrimental FCC actions.\nWe may from time to time modify our business plan, and these changes could adversely affect us and our financial condition.\nWe regularly evaluate our plans and strategy. These evaluations often result in changes to our plans and strategy, some of which may be material. These changes in our plans or strategy may include: the acquisition or termination of unique or compelling programming; the introduction of new features or services; significant new or enhanced distribution arrangements; investments in infrastructure, such as satellites, equipment or radio spectrum; and acquisitions of other businesses, including acquisitions that are not directly related to our satellite radio business.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness, and our revolving credit facility contains certain covenants that restrict our current and future operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had an aggregate principal amount of approximately $4.5 billion of indebtedness, $380 million of which was outstanding under a $1.25 billion Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility.\nOur indebtedness has important consequences. For example, it increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; requires us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on indebtedness, reducing the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures, marketing and other general corporate activities; limits our ability to borrow additional funds; limits our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the audio entertainment industry; and may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other competitors. Our Revolving Credit Agreement contains covenants that, among other things, place certain limitations on our ability to incur more debt, exceed a specified leverage ratio, pay dividends, make distributions, make investments, repurchase stock, create liens, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into sale lease-back transactions, merge or consolidate, and transfer or sell assets. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could cause us to seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws, discontinue operations or seek a purchaser for our business or assets.\nOur broadcast studios, terrestrial repeater networks, satellite uplink facilities or other ground facilities could be damaged by natural catastrophes or terrorist activities.\nAn earthquake, hurricane, tornado, flood, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could damage our broadcast studios, terrestrial repeater networks or satellite uplink facilities, interrupt our service and harm our business.\nAny damage to the satellites that transmit to our terrestrial repeater networks would likely result in degradation of the affected service for some subscribers and could result in complete loss of service in certain or all areas. Damage to our satellite uplink facilities could result in a complete loss of our services until we could transfer operations to suitable back-up facilities.\nOur principal stockholder has significant influence over our management and over actions requiring general stockholder approval and its interests may differ from the interests of other holders of our common stock.\nLiberty Media beneficially owns over 50% of Holdings\u2019 common stock. Two Liberty Media executives and one other member of the board of directors of Liberty Media are members of our board of directors. Gregory B. Maffei, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Liberty Media, is the Chairman of Holdings\u2019 board of directors.\nLiberty Media has the ability to indirectly control our affairs, policies and operations, such as the appointment of management, future issuances of common stock or other securities, the payment of dividends, if any, the incurrence of debt, amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the entering into of extraordinary transactions, and their interests may not in all cases be aligned with the interests of other stockholders of Holdings. In addition, Liberty Media will be able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring general stockholder approval and will be able to cause or prevent a change of control of Holdings or a change in the composition of Holdings\u2019 board of directors and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of our company. The concentration of ownership could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NASDAQ listing rules and, as a result, qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d for the purposes of the NASDAQ Stock Market listing rules. As such, we have elected not to comply with certain NASDAQ corporate governance requirements. A majority of our board of directors consists of independent directors. We do not have a compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee that consist entirely of independent directors.\nOur business may be impaired by third-party intellectual property rights.\nDevelopment of our systems has depended upon the intellectual property that we have developed, as well as intellectual property licensed from third parties. If the intellectual property that we have developed or use is not adequately protected, others will be permitted to and may duplicate portions of our systems or services without liability. In addition, others may challenge, invalidate, render unenforceable or circumvent our intellectual property rights, patents or existing licenses or we may face significant legal costs in connection with defending and enforcing those intellectual property rights. Some of the know-how and technology we have developed, and plan to develop, is not now, nor will it be, covered by U.S. patents or trade secret protections. Trade secret protection and contractual agreements may not provide adequate protection if there is any unauthorized use or disclosure. The loss of necessary technologies could require us to substitute technologies of lower quality performance standards, at greater cost or on a delayed basis, which could harm us.\nOther parties may have patents or pending patent applications, which will later mature into patents or inventions that may block or put limits on our ability to operate our system or license technologies. We may have to resort to litigation to enforce our rights under license agreements or to determine the scope and validity of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights in the subject matter of those licenses. This may be expensive and we may not succeed in any such litigation.\nThird parties may assert claims or bring suit against us for patent, trademark or copyright infringement, or for other infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property rights. Any such litigation could result in substantial cost, and diversion of effort and adverse findings in any proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties; require us to seek licenses from third parties; block our ability to operate our systems or license our technology; or otherwise adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market our satellite radio systems.\nSpecial Note About Forward-Looking Statements\nWe have made various statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that may constitute \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may also be made in our other reports filed with or furnished to the SEC, in our press releases and in other documents. In addition, from time to time, we, through our management, may make oral forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those identified above, which could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. The words \u201cwill likely result,\u201d \u201care expected to,\u201d \u201cwill continue,\u201d \u201cis anticipated,\u201d \u201cestimated,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201clikely,\u201d \u201cprojection,\u201d \u201coutlook\u201d and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We caution you that the risk factors described above are not exclusive. There may also be other risks that we are unable to predict at this time that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which will arise or to assess with any precision the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made.
