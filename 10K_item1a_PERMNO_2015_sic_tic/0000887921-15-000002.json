Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information in this report, investors should consider carefully the following risk factors when evaluating the Company\u2019s business.\nRevlon, Inc. is a holding company with no business operations of its own and is dependent on its subsidiaries to pay certain expenses and dividends. In addition, shares of the capital stock of Products Corporation, Revlon, Inc.'s wholly-owned operating subsidiary, are pledged by Revlon, Inc. to secure its obligations under the Amended Credit Agreements.\nRevlon, Inc. is a holding company with no business operations of its own. Revlon, Inc.\u2019s only material asset is all of the outstanding capital stock of Products Corporation, Revlon, Inc.\u2019s wholly-owned operating subsidiary, through which Revlon, Inc. conducts its business operations. As such, Revlon, Inc.\u2019s net income has historically consisted predominantly of its equity in the net income of Products Corporation, which for 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $47.3 million, $1.6 million and $71.2 million, respectively (which excluded $9.8 million, $8.1 million and $19.3 million, respectively, in expenses primarily related to Revlon, Inc. being a public holding company). Revlon, Inc. is dependent on the earnings and cash flow of, and dividends and distributions from, Products Corporation to pay Revlon, Inc.\u2019s expenses incidental to being a public holding company and to pay any cash dividend or distribution on its Class A Common Stock in each case that may be authorized by Revlon, Inc.\u2019s Board of Directors.\nProducts Corporation may not generate sufficient cash flow to pay dividends or distribute funds to Revlon, Inc. because, for example, Products Corporation may not generate sufficient cash or net income; state laws may restrict or prohibit Products Corporation from issuing dividends or making distributions unless Products Corporation has sufficient surplus or net profits, which Products Corporation may not have; or because contractual restrictions, including negative covenants contained in Products Corporation\u2019s various debt instruments, may prohibit or limit such dividends or distributions.\nThe terms of Products Corporation's Amended Term Loan Agreement and the terms of its third amended and restated revolving credit agreement (together, the \"Amended Credit Agreements\"), and the indenture governing Products Corporation's 5\u00be% Senior Notes (the \"5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture\") generally restrict Products Corporation from paying dividends or advancing or making distributions to Revlon, Inc. except in limited circumstances (including, without limitation, that Products Corporation is permitted to pay dividends and advances and make distributions to Revlon, Inc. to enable Revlon, Inc., among other things, to pay expenses incidental to being a public holding company, including, among other things, professional fees such as legal, accounting and insurance fees, regulatory fees, such as SEC filing fees, NYSE listing fees and other expenses related to being a public holding company and, subject to certain limitations, to pay dividends, if any, on Revlon, Inc.\u2019s outstanding securities or make distributions in certain circumstances to finance the purchase by Revlon, Inc. of its Class A Common Stock in connection with the delivery of such Class A Common Stock to grantees under the Fourth Amended and Restated Revlon, Inc. Stock Plan). This limitation therefore restricts Revlon, Inc.'s ability to pay dividends on its Class A Common Stock.\nAll of the shares of the capital stock of Products Corporation held by Revlon, Inc. are pledged to secure Revlon, Inc.\u2019s guarantee of Products Corporation's obligations under its Amended Credit Agreements. A foreclosure upon the shares of Products Corporation's common stock would result in Revlon, Inc. no longer holding its only material asset and would have a material adverse effect on the holders of Revlon, Inc.\u2019s Common Stock and would be a change of control under Products Corporation\u2019s other debt instruments. (See also \u201cRisk Factors - Shares of Revlon, Inc. Class A Common Stock and Products Corporation\u2019s capital stock are pledged to secure various of Revlon, Inc.\u2019s and/or other of the Company\u2019s affiliates\u2019 obligations and foreclosure upon these shares or dispositions of shares could result in the acceleration of debt under Products Corporation's Amended Credit Agreements and Products Corporation's 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture and could have other consequences.\u201d)\nProducts Corporation\u2019s substantial indebtedness, including the additional Acquisition Term Loan which it used as a source of funds to consummate the Colomer Acquisition, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and flexibility and Products Corporation\u2019s ability to service its debt.\nProducts Corporation has a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness. As of December 31, 2014, the Company\u2019s total indebtedness was $1,875.3 million (or $1,870.5 million net of discounts), primarily including $693.0 million aggregate principal\nREVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\namount outstanding under the Acquisition Term Loan that was executed in 2013 in connection with facilitating the consummation of the Colomer Acquisition, $675.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2011 Term Loan and $500.0 million in aggregate principal face amount outstanding of Products Corporation's 5\u00be% Senior Notes. While Revlon, Inc. achieved net income of $40.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, it recorded a net loss of $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and if the Company is unable to maintain sustained profitability and free cash flow in future periods, it could adversely affect the Company's operations and Products Corporation's ability to service its debt and/or comply with the financial and/or operating covenants under its various debt instruments.\nThe Company is subject to the risks normally associated with substantial indebtedness, including the risk that the Company\u2019s operating revenues will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, and the risk that Products Corporation will be unable to refinance existing indebtedness when it becomes due or, if it is unable to comply with the financial or operating covenants under its debt instruments, to obtain any necessary consents, waivers or amendments or that the terms of any such refinancing and/or consents, waivers or amendments will be less favorable than the current terms of such indebtedness. Products Corporation\u2019s substantial indebtedness could also have the effect of:\n\u2022\nlimiting the Company\u2019s ability to fund (including by obtaining additional financing) the costs and expenses of the execution of the Company\u2019s business strategy (including activities related to continuing the integration of the Colomer business into the Company\u2019s business), future working capital, capital expenditures, advertising, promotional and/or marketing expenses, new product development costs, purchases and reconfigurations of wall displays, acquisitions, acquisition integration costs, investments, restructuring programs and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nrequiring the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on Products Corporation\u2019s indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of the Company\u2019s cash flow for the execution of the Company\u2019s business strategy and for other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nplacing the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022\nexposing the Company to potential events of default (if not cured or waived) under the financial and operating covenants contained in Products Corporation\u2019s debt instruments;\n\u2022\nlimiting the Company\u2019s flexibility in responding to changes in its business and the industry in which it operates; and\n\u2022\nmaking the Company more vulnerable in the event of adverse economic conditions or a downturn in its business.\nAlthough agreements governing Products Corporation\u2019s indebtedness, including the Amended Credit Agreements and the 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture, limit Products Corporation\u2019s ability to borrow additional money, under certain circumstances Products Corporation is allowed to borrow a significant amount of additional money, some of which, in certain circumstances and subject to certain limitations, could be secured indebtedness. To the extent that more debt is added to the Company's current debt levels, the risks described above would increase further.\nProducts Corporation\u2019s ability to pay the principal amount of its indebtedness depends on many factors.\nThe 2011 Term Loan under the Amended Term Loan Facility, with $675.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding, matures in November 2017, and the Acquisition Term Loan under the Amended Term Loan Facility, with $693.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding, matures on the sixth anniversary of the closing of the Acquisition Term Loan (or October 8, 2019). The Amended Revolving Credit Facility matures on the earlier of August 14, 2018 and 90 days prior to the earliest maturity date of any term loans then outstanding under the Amended Term Loan Facility, but not earlier than June 16, 2016. The 5\u00be% Senior Notes mature in February 2021. Products Corporation currently anticipates that, in order to pay the principal amount of its outstanding indebtedness upon the occurrence of any event of default, to repurchase its 5\u00be% Senior Notes if a change of control occurs, or in the event that Products Corporation\u2019s cash flows from operations are insufficient to allow it to pay the principal amount of its indebtedness at maturity, the Company may be required to refinance Products Corporation\u2019s indebtedness, seek to sell assets or operations, seek to sell additional Revlon, Inc. equity, seek to sell Revlon, Inc. debt securities or Products Corporation debt securities or seek additional capital contributions or loans from MacAndrews & Forbes or from the Company\u2019s other affiliates and/or third parties. The Company may be unable to take any of these actions, because of a variety of commercial or market factors or constraints in Products Corporation\u2019s debt instruments, including, for example, market conditions being unfavorable for an equity or debt issuance, additional capital contributions or loans not being available from affiliates and/or third parties, or that the transactions may not be permitted under the terms of the various debt instruments then in effect, such as due to restrictions on the incurrence of debt, incurrence of liens, asset dispositions and/or related party transactions. Such actions, if ever taken, may not enable the Company to satisfy its cash requirements or enable Products Corporation to comply with the financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreements if the actions do not result in sufficient savings or generate a sufficient amount of additional capital, as the case may be.\nNone of the Company\u2019s affiliates are required to make any capital contributions, loans or other payments to Products Corporation regarding its obligations on its indebtedness. Products Corporation may not be able to pay the principal amount of its\nREVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nindebtedness using any of the above actions because, under certain circumstances, the 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture or any of its other debt instruments (including the Amended Credit Agreements) or the debt instruments of Products Corporation\u2019s subsidiaries then in effect may not permit the Company to take such actions. (See \"Restrictions and covenants in Products Corporation\u2019s debt agreements limit its ability to take certain actions and impose consequences in the event of failure to comply\").\nThe future state of the credit markets, including any volatility and/or tightening of the credit markets and reduction in credit availability, could adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to refinance or replace Products Corporation\u2019s outstanding indebtedness at or prior to their respective maturity dates, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nRestrictions and covenants in Products Corporation\u2019s debt agreements limit its ability to take certain actions and impose consequences in the event of failure to comply.\nAgreements governing Products Corporation\u2019s outstanding indebtedness, including the Amended Credit Agreements and the 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture, contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit Products Corporation\u2019s ability (subject in each case to limited exceptions) to, among other things:\n\u2022\nborrow money;\n\u2022\nuse assets as security in other borrowings or transactions;\n\u2022\npay dividends on stock or purchase stock;\n\u2022\nsell assets and use the proceeds from such sales;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase specified indebtedness; and\n\u2022\npermit restrictions on the payment of dividends to Products Corporation by its subsidiaries.\nIn addition, the Amended Credit Agreements contain financial covenants limiting Products Corporation\u2019s first-lien senior secured debt-to-EBITDA ratio (in the case of the Amended Term Loan Agreement) and, under certain circumstances, requiring Products Corporation to maintain a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (in the case of the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement). These covenants affect Products Corporation\u2019s operating flexibility by, among other things, restricting its ability to incur expenses and indebtedness that could otherwise be used to fund the costs of executing the Company\u2019s business strategy (including activities related to continuing the integration of the Colomer business into the Company\u2019s business and other restructuring activities) and to grow the Company\u2019s business, as well as to fund general corporate purposes.\nA breach of the Amended Credit Agreements would permit Products Corporation\u2019s lenders to accelerate amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreements, which would in turn constitute an event of default under the 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture, if the amount accelerated exceeds $25.0 million and such default remains uncured for 10 days following notice from the trustee for the 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture or the holders of at least 30% of the outstanding principal amount of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes. In addition, holders of Products Corporation\u2019s outstanding 5\u00be% Senior Notes may require Products Corporation to repurchase their respective notes in the event of a change of control under the 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture. Products Corporation may not have sufficient funds at the time of any such breach of any such covenant or change of control to repay in full the borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreements or to repurchase or redeem its outstanding 5\u00be% Senior Notes.\nEvents beyond the Company\u2019s control could impair the Company\u2019s operating performance, which could affect Products Corporation\u2019s ability to comply with the terms of Products Corporation\u2019s debt instruments. Such events may include decreased consumer spending in response to weak economic conditions or weakness in the consumption of beauty care products; adverse changes in currency exchange rates, currency controls and/or government-mandated pricing controls; decreased sales of the Company's products as a result of increased competitive activities by the Company\u2019s competitors; changes in consumer purchasing habits, including with respect to shopping channels; inventory management by the Company's customers; space reconfigurations or reductions in display space by the Company's customers; changes in pricing or promotional strategies by the Company's customers; less than anticipated results from the Company's existing or new products or from its advertising, promotional and/or marketing plans; or if the Company\u2019s expenses, including, without limitation, for pension expense under its benefit plans, acquisition-related integration costs, advertising, promotional and/or marketing activities or for sales returns related to any reduction of space by the Company's customers, product discontinuances or otherwise, exceed the anticipated level of expenses.\nUnder such circumstances, Products Corporation may be unable to comply with the provisions of its debt instruments, including the financial covenants in the Amended Credit Agreements. If Products Corporation is unable to satisfy such covenants or other provisions at any future time, Products Corporation would need to seek an amendment or waiver of such financial covenants or other provisions. The respective lenders under the Amended Credit Agreements may not consent to any amendment or waiver\nREVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nrequests that Products Corporation may make in the future, and, if they do consent, they may only do so on terms that are unfavorable to Products Corporation and/or Revlon, Inc.\nIn the event that Products Corporation is unable to obtain any such waiver or amendment, Products Corporation's inability to meet the financial covenants or other provisions of the Amended Credit Agreements would constitute an event of default under its Amended Credit Agreements, which would permit the bank lenders to accelerate the Amended Credit Agreements and would constitute an event of default under the 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture if the amount accelerated exceeds $25.0 million and such default remains uncured for 10 days following notice from the trustee for the 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture or the holders of at least 30% of the outstanding principal amount of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes.\nProducts Corporation\u2019s assets and/or cash flow and/or that of Products Corporation\u2019s subsidiaries may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under its outstanding debt instruments, either upon maturity or if accelerated upon an event of default, and if Products Corporation is required to repurchase its outstanding 5\u00be% Senior Notes or repay the Amended Credit Agreements upon a change of control, Products Corporation may be unable to refinance or restructure the payments on such debt. Further, if Products Corporation is unable to repay, refinance or restructure its indebtedness under the Amended Credit Agreements the lenders, subject to certain conditions and limitations as set forth in the third amended and restated intercreditor agreement, could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness.\nLimits on Products Corporation's borrowing capacity under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility may affect the Company's ability to finance its operations.\nWhile the Amended Revolving Credit Facility currently provides for up to $175.0 million of commitments, Products Corporation's ability to borrow funds under such facility is limited by a borrowing base determined relative to the value, from time to time, of eligible trade receivables and eligible inventory in the U.S. and the U.K. and eligible real property and equipment in the U.S. In January 2014, the Colomer U.S. Subsidiaries became additional guarantors under Products Corporation\u2019s Amended Term Loan Facility and Amended Revolving Credit Facility and the 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture. In connection with becoming guarantors, substantially all of the assets of the Colomer U.S. Subsidiaries were pledged as collateral under Products Corporation\u2019s Amended Term Loan Facility and Amended Revolving Credit Facility, thereby increasing the value of the assets supporting the borrowing base under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility.\nIf the value of these eligible assets is not sufficient to support the full $175.0 million borrowing base, Products Corporation will not have full access to the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, but rather could have access to a lesser amount determined by the borrowing base. As Products Corporation continues to manage its working capital, this could reduce the borrowing base under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility. Further, if Products Corporation borrows funds under such facility, subsequent changes in the value or eligibility of the assets within the borrowing base could cause Products Corporation to be required to pay down the amounts outstanding under such facility so that there is no amount outstanding in excess of the then-existing borrowing base.\nProducts Corporation's ability to borrow under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility is also conditioned upon its compliance with other covenants in the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement governing such facility, including a fixed charge coverage ratio that applies when the difference between (1) the borrowing base under such facility and (2) the amounts outstanding under such facility is less than $20.0 million. Because of these limitations, Products Corporation may not always be able to meet its cash requirements with funds borrowed under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2014, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Acquisition Term Loan and the 2011 Term Loan was $693.0 million and $675.0 million, respectively, with the Company having a liquidity position of $435.7 million, consisting of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (net of any outstanding checks) of $269.7 million, as well as $166.0 million in available borrowings under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, based upon the calculated borrowing base less $9.0 million of undrawn outstanding letters of credit and nil then drawn under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility at such date.\nThe Amended Revolving Credit Facility is syndicated to a group of banks and financial institutions. Each bank is responsible to lend its portion of the $175.0 million commitment if and when Products Corporation seeks to draw under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility. The lenders may assign their commitments to other banks and financial institutions in certain cases without prior notice to Products Corporation. If a lender is unable to meet its lending commitment, then the other lenders under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility have the right, but not the obligation, to lend additional funds to make up for the defaulting lender\u2019s commitment, if any. Products Corporation has never had any of its lenders under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility fail to fulfill their lending commitment. Based on information available to the Company, the Company has no reason to believe that any of the lenders under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility would be unable to fulfill their commitments to lend under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2014. However, it is possible that economic conditions and potential volatility in the financial markets, among other factors, could impact the liquidity and financial condition of certain banks and financial institutions. If one or more lenders under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility were unable to fulfill their commitment to lend, such inability would impact the Company's liquidity and, depending upon the amount involved and the Company's liquidity\nREVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nrequirements, could have an adverse effect on the Company's ability to fund its operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nA substantial portion of Products Corporation's indebtedness is subject to floating interest rates.\nA substantial portion of Products Corporation's indebtedness is subject to floating interest rates, which makes the Company more vulnerable in the event of adverse economic conditions, increases in prevailing interest rates or a downturn in the Company's business. As of December 31, 2014, $1,372.8 million of Products Corporation's total indebtedness (or $1,368.0 million net of discounts), or approximately 73% of Products Corporation's total indebtedness, was subject to floating interest rates.\nUnder the Amended Term Loan Agreement, as of December 31, 2014 the $693.0 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Acquisition Term Loan and the $675.0 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2011 Term Loan bear interest, at Products Corporation's option, at either the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the Amended Term Loan Agreement) plus 2.5% and 3.0% per annum, respectively (provided that in no event shall the Eurodollar Rate (which is based upon LIBOR) be less than 0.75% and 1.0% per annum, respectively), or the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Amended Term Loan Agreement) plus 1.5% and 2.0% per annum, respectively, which Alternate Base Rate is based on the greater of Citibank, N.A.\u2019s announced base rate and the U.S. federal funds rate plus 0.5% (provided that in no event shall the Alternative Base Rate be less than 1.75% and 2.0% per annum, respectively).\nIn November 2013, Products Corporation entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap in a single derivative with a notional amount of $400.0 million in respect of indebtedness under the Acquisition Term Loan for a 3-year period beginning in May 2015 (the \"2013 Interest Rate Swap\"). Under the terms of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap, Products Corporation will be required to pay to the counterparty a quarterly fixed interest rate of 2.0709% on the $400.0 million notional amount, while receiving variable interest rate payments from the counterparty equal to the 3-month U.S. dollar LIBOR, with a LIBOR floor of 1.00% (which effectively fixes the interest rate on such notional amount at 5.0709% over the 3-year term of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap). While Products Corporation may enter into other interest hedging contracts, it may not be able to do so on a cost-effective basis, and any hedging transactions that Products Corporation enters into may not achieve their intended purpose and shifts in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2014, the Eurodollar Rate, LIBOR and the Alternate Base Rate for the Acquisition Term Loan and the 2011 Term Loan were as follows:\nPursuant to the 2013 Interest Rate Swap, the LIBOR portion of the interest rate on $400.0 million of outstanding indebtedness under the Acquisition Term Loan is effectively fixed at 5.0709% beginning in May 2015 through May 2018. Borrowings under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility (other than loans in foreign currencies) bear interest at a rate equal to, at Products Corporation's option, either (i) the Eurodollar Rate plus the applicable margin set forth in the grid below, or (ii) the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement) plus the applicable margin set forth in the grid below:\nLocal Loans (as defined in the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement) bear interest, if mutually acceptable to Products Corporation and the relevant foreign lenders, at the Local Rate, and otherwise (i) if in foreign currencies or in U.S. Dollars, at the Eurodollar Rate or the Eurocurrency Rate plus the applicable margin set forth in the grid above or (ii) if in U.S. Dollars, at the Alternate Base Rate plus the applicable margin set forth in the grid above.\nIf any of LIBOR, Euribor, the base rate, the U.S. federal funds rate or such equivalent local currency rate increases, Products Corporation's debt service costs will increase to the extent that Products Corporation has elected such rates for its outstanding loans. Based on the amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreements, and other short-term borrowings (which, in the\nREVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\naggregate, are Products Corporation\u2019s only debt currently subject to floating interest rates) as of December 31, 2014, an increase in LIBOR and Euribor of 1% would increase the Company\u2019s annual interest expense by $13.9 million. Increased debt service costs would adversely affect the Company's cash flow.\nThe Company depends on its Oxford, North Carolina facility for production of a substantial portion of its products within the Consumer segment. Disruptions at this facility, and/or at other Company or third party facilities at which the Company's products are manufactured for both its Consumer and Professional segments, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nThe Company produces a substantial portion of its products at its Oxford, North Carolina facility. Significant unscheduled downtime at this facility, or at other Company facilities, including those that the Company recently acquired within the Professional segment, and/or third party facilities at which the Company's products are manufactured, whether due to equipment breakdowns, power failures, natural disasters, weather conditions hampering delivery schedules or other disruptions, including those caused by transitioning manufacturing across these facilities, or any other cause could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to provide products to its customers, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's sales, business, financial condition and/or results of operations. Additionally, if product sales exceed forecasts or production, the Company could, from time to time, not have an adequate supply of products to meet customer demands, which could cause the Company to lose sales.\nThe Company's new product introductions may not be as successful as the Company anticipates, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nThe Company has a rigorous process for the continuous development and evaluation of new product concepts, led by executives in marketing, sales, research and development, product development, operations, law and finance. Each new product launch, including those resulting from this new product development process, carries risks, as well as the possibility of unexpected consequences, including:\n\u2022\nthe acceptance of the new product launches by, and sales of such new products to, the Company's customers may not be as high as the Company anticipates;\n\u2022\nthe Company's advertising, promotional and/or marketing strategies for its new products may be less effective than planned and may fail to effectively reach the targeted consumer base or engender the desired consumption;\n\u2022\nthe rate of purchases by the Company's consumers may not be as high as the Company anticipates;\n\u2022\nthe Company's wall displays to showcase its new products may fail to achieve their intended effects;\n\u2022\nthe Company may experience out-of-stocks and/or product returns exceeding its expectations as a result of its new product launches or space reconfigurations or reductions in retail display space by its customers or the Company's net sales may be impacted by inventory management by its customers or changes in pricing or promotional strategies by its customers;\n\u2022\nthe Company may incur costs exceeding its expectations as a result of the continued development and launch of new products, including, for example, advertising, promotional and/or marketing expenses, sales return expenses or other costs related to launching new products;\n\u2022\nthe Company may experience a decrease in sales of certain of the Company's existing products as a result of newly-launched products, the impact of which could be exacerbated by shelf space limitations and/or any shelf space loss. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors -\"Competition in the cosmetics, hair and beauty care products business could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\")\n\u2022\nthe Company's product pricing strategies for new product launches may not be accepted by its customers and/or its consumers, which may result in the Company's sales being less than it anticipates;\n\u2022\nthe Company may experience a decrease in sales of certain of the Company's products as a result of counterfeit products and/or products sold outside of their intended territories; and\n\u2022\nany delays or difficulties impacting the Company's ability, or the ability of the Company's suppliers, to timely manufacture, distribute and ship products, displays or display walls in connection with launching new products, such as due to inclement weather conditions or those delays or difficulties discussed under Item 1A.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe Company's ability to service its debt and meet its cash requirements depends on many factors, including achieving anticipated levels of revenue and expenses. If such revenue or expense levels prove to be other than as anticipated, the Company may be unable to meet its cash requirements or Products Corporation may be unable to meet the requirements of the financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nThe Company currently expects that operating revenues, cash on hand, and funds available for borrowing under the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement and other permitted lines of credit will be sufficient to enable the Company to cover its operating expenses for 2015, including cash requirements for the payment of expenses in connection with the execution of the Company's business strategy and its advertising, promotional and/or marketing plans, integration costs related to the Colomer Acquisition, purchases of permanent wall displays, capital expenditure requirements, debt service payments and costs, tax payments, pension and post-retirement plan contributions, payments in connection with the Company's restructuring programs, severance not otherwise included in the Company's restructuring programs and debt and/or equity repurchases, if any.\nIf the Company's anticipated level of revenue is not achieved, however, because of, for example, decreased consumer spending in response to weak economic conditions or weakness in the consumption of beauty care products; adverse changes in currency exchange rates, currency controls and/or government-mandated pricing controls; decreased sales of the Company's products as a result of increased competitive activities by the Company's competitors; changes in consumer purchasing habits, including with respect to shopping channels; inventory management by the Company's customers; space reconfigurations or reductions in display space by the Company's customers; changes in pricing or promotional strategies by the Company's customers; less than anticipated results from the Company's existing or new products or from its advertising, promotional and/or marketing plans; or if the Company's expenses, including, without limitation, for pension expense under its benefit plans, integration costs related to the Colomer Acquisition, advertising, promotional or marketing activities or for sales returns related to any reduction of space by the Company's customers, product discontinuances or otherwise, exceed the anticipated level of expenses, the Company's current sources of funds may be insufficient to meet its cash requirements. In addition, such developments, if significant, could reduce the Company's revenues and could have a material adverse effect on Products Corporation's ability to comply with certain financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreements.\nIf the Company's operating revenues, cash on hand and/or funds available for borrowing are insufficient to cover the Company's expenses or are insufficient to enable Products Corporation to comply with the financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreements, the Company could be required to adopt one or more of the alternatives listed below:\n\u2022\ndelaying the implementation of or revising certain aspects of the Company's business strategy (including activities related to continuing the integration of the Colomer business into the Company\u2019s business);\n\u2022\nreducing or delaying purchases of wall displays and/or expenses related to the Company's advertising, promotional and/or marketing activities;\n\u2022\nreducing or delaying capital spending;\n\u2022\nimplementing new restructuring programs;\n\u2022\nrefinancing Products Corporation's indebtedness;\n\u2022\nselling assets or operations;\n\u2022\nseeking additional capital contributions and/or loans from MacAndrews & Forbes, the Company's other affiliates and/or third parties;\n\u2022\nselling additional Revlon, Inc. equity or debt securities or Products Corporation's debt securities; or\n\u2022\nreducing other discretionary spending.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company would be able to take any of these actions, because of a variety of commercial or market factors or constraints in Products Corporation's debt instruments, including, for example, market conditions being unfavorable for an equity or a debt issuance, additional capital contributions or loans not being available from affiliates and/or third parties, or that the transactions may not be permitted under the terms of Products Corporation's various debt instruments then in effect, such as due to restrictions on the incurrence of debt, incurrence of liens, asset dispositions and/or related party transactions. If the Company is required to take any of these actions, it could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nSuch actions, if ever taken, may not enable the Company to satisfy its cash requirements or enable Products Corporation to comply with the financial covenants under its Amended Credit Agreements if the actions do not result in sufficient savings or generate a sufficient amount of additional capital, as the case may be. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors - \u201cRestrictions and covenants in Products Corporation's debt agreements limit its ability to take certain actions and impose consequences in the event of failure\nREVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nto comply,\u201d which discusses, among other things, the consequences of noncompliance with Products Corporation's credit agreement covenants).\nEconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations or on the financial condition of its customers and suppliers.\nEconomic conditions, in the U.S. and/or other countries where the Company operates, have contributed and may continue to contribute to high unemployment levels, lower consumer spending and reduced credit availability, and have impacted and could in the future impact business and consumer confidence. Such conditions could have an impact on consumer purchases and/or customer purchases of the Company's products, which could result in a reduction of net sales, operating income and/or cash flows. Additionally, disruptions in the credit and other financial markets and economic conditions could, among other things, impair the financial condition of one or more of the Company's customers or suppliers, thereby increasing the risk of customer bad debts or non-performance by suppliers. These conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nThe Company depends on a limited number of customers for a large portion of its net sales, and the loss of one or more of these customers could reduce the Company's net sales and have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nWalmart and its affiliates worldwide accounted for approximately 16%, 20% and 22% of the Company\u2019s worldwide net sales for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company expects that, for future periods, Walmart and a small number of other customers in the Consumer and Professional segments will, in the aggregate, continue to account for a large portion of the Company's net sales. These customers have demanded, and may continue to demand, increased service and other accommodations. The Company may be affected by changes in the policies and demands of its customers relating to service levels, inventory de-stocking, pricing and promotional strategies or limitations on access to wall display space. As is customary in the consumer products industry, none of the Company's customers is under an obligation to continue purchasing products from the Company in the future.\nThe loss of Walmart or one or more of the Company's other customers that may account for a significant portion of the Company's net sales, or any significant decrease in sales to these customers, including as a result of consolidation among the Company's customers, inventory management by the Company's customers, changes in pricing or promotional strategies by the Company's customers or space reconfigurations by the Company's customers or any significant decrease in the Company's display space, could reduce the Company's net sales and/or operating income and therefore could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nDeclines in the financial markets may result in increased pension expense and increased cash contributions to the Company's pension plans.\nDeclines in the U.S. and global financial markets could result in significant declines in the Company's pension plan assets and result in increased pension expense and cash contributions to the Company's pension plans. Interest rate levels will affect the discount rate used to value the Company's year-end pension benefit obligations. One or more of these factors, individually or taken together, could impact future required cash contributions to the Company's pension plans and pension expense. Any one or more of these conditions could reduce the Company's available liquidity, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nThe Company may be unable to maintain or increase its sales through the Company's primary distribution channels, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nA decrease in consumer demand in the U.S. and internationally for beauty care products, inventory management by the Company's customers, changes in pricing or promotional strategies by the Company's customers (such as the development and/or expansion of their own private label brands), a reduction in display space by the Company's customers and/or a change in consumers\u2019 purchasing habits, such as by buying more cosmetics and beauty care products in channels in which the Company does not currently compete (such as prestige and department stores, television shopping, door-to-door, specialty stores, the internet, perfumeries and other distribution outlets, which combine to account for a significant amount of beauty care sales), could impact sales of the Company's products, which could reduce the Company's net sales and which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nCompetition in the cosmetics, hair and beauty care products business could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nThe cosmetics, hair and beauty care products business is highly competitive. The Company competes primarily by:\n\u2022\ndeveloping quality products with innovative performance features, shades, finishes and packaging;\n\u2022\neducating consumers and salon professionals about the benefits of the Company\u2019s products;\nREVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\u2022\nanticipating and responding to changing consumer and salon professional demands in a timely manner, including the timing of new product introductions and line extensions;\n\u2022\noffering attractively priced products, relative to the product benefits provided;\n\u2022\nmaintaining favorable brand recognition;\n\u2022\ngenerating competitive margins and inventory turns for the Company\u2019s customers by providing relevant products and executing effective pricing, incentive and promotion programs;\n\u2022\nensuring product availability through effective planning and replenishment collaboration with the Company's customers;\n\u2022\nproviding strong and effective advertising, promotion, marketing and merchandising support;\n\u2022\nmaintaining an effective sales force and distribution network; and\n\u2022\nobtaining and retaining sufficient display space, optimal in-store positioning and effective presentation of the Company\u2019s products on-shelf.\nAn increase in or change in the current level of competition that the Company faces could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nIn addition, the Company competes against a number of multi-national manufacturers, some of which are larger and have substantially greater resources than the Company, and which may therefore have the ability to spend more aggressively than the Company on advertising, promotions and marketing and have more flexibility than the Company to respond to changing business and economic conditions. The Company's products also compete with similar products sold through channels other than those in which it competes, including prestige and department stores, television shopping, door-to-door, specialty stores, the internet, perfumeries and other distribution outlets.\nAdditionally, the Company's major customers periodically assess the allocation of display space among competitors and in the course of doing so could elect to reduce the display space allocated to the Company's products, if, for example, the Company's marketing strategies for its new and/or existing products are less effective than planned, fail to effectively reach the targeted consumer base, fail to engender the desired consumption and/or fail to sustain productive levels of consumption dollar share; and/or the rate of purchases by the Company's consumers are not as high as the Company anticipates. Within the Company\u2019s Consumer segment, among the factors used by the Company\u2019s major customers in assessing the allocation of display space is a brand\u2019s share of the color cosmetics category in the U.S. mass retail channel. The Company's color cosmetics brands have experienced, over time, year-over-year share declines in its color cosmetics brands in the U.S. mass retail channel and it is possible that the Company may continue to experience further share declines. Further declines in the Company's share in the U.S. mass retail channel could, among other things, contribute to a loss of display space and/or decreased revenues. Any significant loss of display space could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nThe Company's foreign operations are subject to a variety of social, political and economic risks and have been, and are expected to continue to be, affected by foreign currency fluctuations, currency controls and/or government-mandated pricing controls, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations and the value of its foreign assets.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company had operations based in 24 foreign countries and its products were sold in approximately 150 countries. The Company is exposed to risks associated with social, political and economic conditions, including inflation, inherent in operating in foreign countries, including those in Asia (including Japan), Australia, Eastern Europe, South America (including Venezuela and Argentina) and South Africa, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations. Such risks arise from laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where the Company has operations, hyperinflation, currency devaluation, currency controls, government-mandated pricing controls, currency remittance restrictions, changes in consumer purchasing habits (including as to shopping channels), as well as, to a lesser extent, changes in U.S. laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment.\nThese risks and limitations could affect the ability of the Company's foreign subsidiaries to obtain sufficient capital to conduct their operations in the ordinary course of business. These limitations and the difficulties that certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries may experience on the free flow of funds to these foreign subsidiaries could restrict the Company's ability to respond timely to challenging market conditions or changes in operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nCurrency restrictions enacted by the Venezuelan government, which began in 2003, have impacted the ability of Revlon Venezuela to obtain U.S. Dollars in exchange for local currency at the official foreign exchange rates. Revlon Venezuela accounted for approximately 1% of the Company's net sales for each of 2014 and 2013 and 2% of the Company's net sales for 2012.\nREVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nEffective January 1, 2010, Venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP and as a result of that hyperinflationary designation and the devaluation of Venezuela's currency, the Company's results of operations in 2010 were adversely impacted. As a result, through 2012, the Company used alternative foreign currency markets with less favorable exchange rates to access U.S. Dollars for Revlon Venezuela, which also adversely impacted the Company's results of operations. Throughout 2013, the Company imported certain products at a rate of 6.3 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar, which represented the Venezuela foreign exchange commission's Official Rate. In March 2014, a parallel foreign currency exchange system, SICAD II, started functioning which allows companies to apply for the purchase of foreign currency and foreign currency denominated securities for any legal use or purpose. During 2014, SICAD II has had an average transaction rate to the Company of approximately 53 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar (the \"SICAD II Rate\").\nThroughout 2014, the Company exchanged Bolivars for U.S. Dollars to the extent permitted through the various foreign currency markets available to the Company based on its ability to participate in those markets. Prior to June 30, 2014, the Company utilized the Official Rate of 6.3 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar. Following a consideration of the Company's specific facts and circumstances, which included its legal ability and intent to participate in the SICAD II exchange market to import finished goods into Venezuela, the Company determined that it was appropriate to utilize the SICAD II Rate of 53 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar to translate Revlon Venezuela\u2019s financial statements beginning on June 30, 2014. As a result, the Company recorded a foreign currency loss of $6.0 million in the second quarter of 2014 related to the required re-measurement of Revlon Venezuela\u2019s monetary assets and liabilities. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the change to the SICAD II Rate of 53 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar, as compared to the 6.3 Official Rate, has had the impact of reducing the Company's consolidated net sales by $16.2 million and reducing the Company's consolidated operating income by $8.4 million.\nThe Company's net sales outside of the U.S. for each of 2014, 2013 and 2012 were approximately 47%, 44% and 43% of the Company's total consolidated net sales, respectively. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the Company's results of operations and the value of the Company's foreign assets in 2015, which in turn could cause a material adverse effect on the Company's reported net sales and earnings and the comparability of period-to-period results of operations.\nProducts Corporation enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge certain net cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. The foreign currency forward exchange contracts are entered into primarily for the purpose of hedging anticipated inventory purchases and certain intercompany payments denominated in foreign currencies and generally have maturities of less than one year. At December 31, 2014, the notional amount of Products Corporation's foreign currency forward exchange contracts was $7.6 million. The foreign currency forward exchange contracts that Products Corporation enters into may not adequately protect against foreign currency fluctuations.\nTerrorist attacks, acts of war or military actions and/or other civil unrest may adversely affect the territories in which the Company operates and the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nOn September 11, 2001, the U.S. was the target of terrorist attacks of unprecedented scope. These attacks contributed to major instability in the U.S. and other financial markets and reduced consumer confidence. These terrorist attacks, as well as terrorist attacks such as those that have occurred in Paris, France, Benghazi, Libya, Madrid, Spain and London, England, attempted terrorist attacks, military responses to terrorist attacks, other military actions and/or civil unrest such as that recently occurring in the Ukraine, Venezuela, Syria, Iraq and surrounding areas, may adversely affect prevailing economic conditions, resulting in work stoppages, reduced consumer spending and/or reduced demand for the Company's products. These developments subject the Company's worldwide operations to increased risks and, depending on their magnitude, could reduce net sales and therefore could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nThe Company's products are subject to federal, state and international regulations that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) and the Food and Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d), in the U.S., as well as various other federal, state, local and foreign regulatory authorities, including those in the European Union, or the EU, Canada and other countries in which the Company operates. The Company's Oxford, North Carolina and Jacksonville, Florida manufacturing facilities are registered with the FDA as drug manufacturing establishments, permitting the manufacture of cosmetics and other beauty-care products that contain over-the-counter drug ingredients, such as sunscreens and anti-perspirant deodorants in the case of the Oxford, North Carolina facility and anti-dandruff hair-care products in the case of the Jacksonville, Florida facility. Regulations in the U.S., the EU, Canada and other countries in which the Company operates that are designed to protect consumers or the environment have an increasing influence on the Company's product claims, ingredients and packaging. To the extent federal, state, local and/or foreign regulatory changes occur in the future, they could require the Company to reformulate or discontinue certain of its products or revise its product packaging or labeling, any of which could result in, among other things, increased costs to the Company, delays in product launches, product returns or recalls and lower net sales, and therefore could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nREVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe failure of the Company's information technology systems and/or difficulties or delays in implementing new information technology systems could disrupt the Company's business operations which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nThe operation of the Company's business depends on the Company's information technology systems. The Company relies on its information technology systems to effectively manage, among other things, the Company's business data, communications, supply chain, inventory management, customer order entry and order fulfillment, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, human resources benefits and payroll management, compliance with regulatory, legal and tax requirements and other processes and data necessary to manage the Company's business. The failure of the Company's information technology systems, including any failure of the Company's current systems and/or as a result of transitioning to additional or replacement information technology systems, as the case may be, to perform as the Company anticipates could disrupt the Company's business and could result in, among other things, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, loss of data and the loss of sales and customers, which could cause the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations to suffer. In addition, the Company's information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond the Company's control, including, without limitation, fire, natural disasters, power outages, systems failure, system conversions, security breaches, cyber-attacks, viruses and/or human error. In any such event, the Company could be required to make a significant investment to fix or replace its information technology systems, and the Company could experience interruptions in its ability to service its customers. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nThe Company is currently implementing a company-wide SAP enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system. The Company's anticipated implementation of this SAP ERP system may not result in improvements that outweigh its costs and may disrupt the Company's operations. This system implementation subjects the Company to substantial costs, the majority of which are capital expenditures, and inherent risks associated with migrating from the Company's legacy systems. These costs and risks could include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ninability to fill customer orders accurately or on a timely basis, or at all;\n\u2022\ninability to process payments to vendors accurately or in a timely manner;\n\u2022\ndisruption of the Company's internal control structure;\n\u2022\ninability to fulfill the Company's SEC or other governmental reporting requirements in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u2022\ninability to fulfill federal, state and local tax filing requirements in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u2022\nincreased demands on management and staff time to the detriment of other corporate initiatives; and\n\u2022\nsignificant capital and operating expenditures.\nIf the Company is unable to successfully plan, design or implement this new SAP ERP system, in whole or in part, or experience unanticipated difficulties or delays in doing so, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nThe illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit versions of the Company\u2019s products or the unauthorized diversion by third parties of the Company\u2019s products could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s revenues and a negative impact on the Company\u2019s reputation and business.\nThird parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of the Company\u2019s products. These counterfeit products may be inferior in terms of quality and other characteristics compared to the Company\u2019s authentic products and/or the counterfeit products could pose safety risks that the Company\u2019s authentic products would not otherwise present to consumers. Consumers could confuse counterfeit products with the Company\u2019s authentic products, which could damage or diminish the image, reputation and/or value of the Company\u2019s brands and cause consumers to refrain from purchasing the Company\u2019s products in the future, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s reputation.\nA substantial portion of the products that the Company sells under its Professional segment are sold to professional salon distributors and/or wholesalers. Products sold in these channels are meant to be used exclusively by salons and individual salon professionals or are sold exclusively to the retail consumers of these salons. Despite the Company\u2019s efforts to prevent diversion of such products from these distribution channels, incidents have occurred and continue to occur whereby the Company\u2019s products are sold to sales outlets other than the intended salons and salon professionals, such as to general merchandise retailers or unapproved outlets. In some instances, these diverted products may be old, damaged or otherwise adulterated, which could damage or diminish the image, reputation and/or value of the Company\u2019s brands. In addition, such diversion may result in lower net sales of the Company\u2019s products if consumers choose to purchase diverted products and/or or choose to purchase products manufactured or sold by the Company\u2019s competitors because of any perceived damage or diminishment to the image, reputation and/or value of the Company\u2019s brands.\nREVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe Company believes that its trademarks, patents and other intellectual property rights are extremely important to the Company\u2019s success and its competitive position. The Company devotes significant resources to registering and protecting its intellectual property rights and maintaining the positive image of its brands. The Company\u2019s trademark and patent applications may fail to result in issued registrations or provide the scope of coverage sought. Unplanned increases in legal fees and other costs associated with enforcing and/or defending the Company\u2019s trademarks, patents and/or other intellectual property rights could result in higher than expected operating expenses. The Company has been unable to eliminate, and may in the future be unable to eliminate, all counterfeiting activities, unauthorized product diversion and infringement of its trademarks, patents and/or other intellectual property, any of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s reputation.\nThe Company\u2019s success largely depends upon its ability to attract, hire and retain its senior management team, other key employees and a highly skilled and diverse workforce, as well as effectively implement succession planning for its senior management team, and, as such, the Company\u2019s inability to do so could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nThe continued execution of the Company's business strategy largely depends on the Company\u2019s ability to attract, hire and retain its senior management team, other key employees and a highly skilled and diverse workforce, as well as effectively implement succession planning for its senior management team. Unexpected levels of employee turnover or the Company\u2019s failure to maintain an adequate succession plan to effectively transition current management leadership positions and/or the Company\u2019s failure to attract, hire and retain its senior management team, other key employees and a highly skilled and diverse workforce could adversely affect the Company\u2019s institutional knowledge base and/or competitive advantage. If the Company is unable to attract, hire and/or retain talented and highly qualified senior management, other key employees and/or a highly skilled and diverse workforce, or if the Company is unable to effectively provide for the succession of its senior management team, it could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nShares of Revlon, Inc. Class A Common Stock and Products Corporation's capital stock are pledged to secure various of Revlon, Inc.'s and/or other of the Company's affiliates\u2019 obligations and foreclosure upon these shares or dispositions of shares could result in the acceleration of debt under Products Corporation's Amended Credit Agreements and Products Corporation's 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture and could have other consequences.\nAll of Products Corporation's shares of common stock are pledged to secure Revlon, Inc.\u2019s guarantee under the Amended Credit Agreements. MacAndrews & Forbes has advised the Company that it has pledged shares of Revlon, Inc.\u2019s Class A Common Stock to secure certain obligations of MacAndrews & Forbes. Additional shares of Revlon, Inc. and shares of common stock of intermediate holding companies between Revlon, Inc. and MacAndrews & Forbes may from time to time be pledged to secure obligations of MacAndrews & Forbes. A default under any of these obligations that are secured by the pledged shares could cause a foreclosure with respect to such shares of Revlon, Inc.'s Class A Common Stock, Products Corporation's common stock or stock of intermediate holding companies between Revlon, Inc. and MacAndrews & Forbes.\nA foreclosure upon any such shares of common stock or dispositions of shares of Revlon, Inc.\u2019s Class A Common Stock, Products Corporation's common stock or stock of intermediate holding companies between Revlon, Inc. and MacAndrews & Forbes which are beneficially owned by MacAndrews & Forbes could, in a sufficient amount, constitute a \u201cchange of control\u201d under the Amended Credit Agreements and the 5\u00be% Senior Notes Indenture. A change of control constitutes an event of default under the Amended Credit Agreements which would permit Products Corporation's lenders to accelerate amounts outstanding under such facilities. In addition, holders of the 5\u00be% Senior Notes may require Products Corporation to repurchase their respective 5\u00be% Senior Notes under those circumstances.\nProducts Corporation may not have sufficient funds at the time of any such change of control to repay in full the borrowings under the Amended Credit Facilities and/or to repurchase or redeem the 5\u00be% Senior Notes. (See \u201c- The Company's ability to service its debt and meet its cash requirements depends on many factors, including achieving anticipated levels of revenue and expenses. If such revenue or expense levels prove to be other than as anticipated, the Company may be unable to meet its cash requirements or Products Corporation may be unable to meet the requirements of the financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreements which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\u201d)\nMacAndrews & Forbes has the power to direct and control the Company's business.\nMacAndrews & Forbes is wholly-owned by Ronald O. Perelman. Mr. Perelman, through MacAndrews & Forbes, beneficially owned approximately 78% of Revlon, Inc.'s outstanding Class A Common Stock on December 31, 2014. As a result, MacAndrews & Forbes is able to control the election of the entire Board of Directors of Revlon, Inc. and of Products Corporation's Board of Directors (as it is a wholly owned subsidiary of Revlon, Inc.) and controls the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of Revlon, Inc.\u2019s and Products Corporation's stockholders, including the approval of mergers, consolidations, sales of some, substantially all or all of the Company's assets, issuances of capital stock and similar transactions.\nREVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe Company may not be able to efficiently integrate Colomer into the Company\u2019s ongoing business operations, which may result in the Company\u2019s inability to fully realize the intended benefits of the Colomer Acquisition, or may disrupt the Company's current operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position and/or results of operations.\nThe Company is in the process of integrating the operations of Colomer into the Company\u2019s business and expects to achieve approximately $30.0 million to $35.0 million of annualized cost reductions by the end of 2015, at a cost of approximately $50.0 million in the aggregate through 2015. The ongoing process of continuing to integrate Colomer into the Company's business involves complex operational, technological and personnel-related challenges, which are time-consuming and expensive and may disrupt the Company's ongoing core business operations. These integration activities involve a number of risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ndifficulties or complications in combining the companies' operations;\n\u2022\ndifferences in controls, procedures and policies, regulatory standards and business cultures among the combined companies;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management's attention from the Company's ongoing core business operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties or delays in consolidating Colomer\u2019s information technology platforms, including implementing systems designed to continue to ensure that the Company maintains effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting for the combined company and enable the Company to continue to comply with U.S. GAAP and applicable U.S. securities laws and regulations;\n\u2022\npossible disruptions that could result from efforts to consolidate the combined Company\u2019s manufacturing facilities or changes in the combined Company\u2019s supply chain, including work stoppages;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs and other assumed contingent liabilities; and/or\n\u2022\npossible tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of the combined company.\nThese factors could cause the Company to not fully realize the anticipated financial and/or strategic benefits of the Colomer Acquisition, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and/or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 82859, "SIC": 2844, "TIC": "REV"}
