{"cik": "1326583", "company": "WebMD Health Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis section describes circumstances or events that could have a negative effect on our financial results or operations or that could change, for the worse, existing trends in some or all of our businesses. The occurrence of one or more of the circumstances or events described below could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows or on the trading prices of our Common Stock and Convertible Notes or of securities that we may issue in the future. The risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us, or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also adversely affect our business and operations.\nRisks Related to Our Operations and the Healthcare Content We Provide\nIf we are unable to provide content and services that attract users to The WebMD Health Network, our advertising and sponsorship revenue could be reduced\nUsers of The WebMD Health Network have numerous other online and offline sources of healthcare information and related services. Our ability to compete for user traffic on The WebMD Health Network depends upon our ability to make available a variety of health, wellness and medical content, decision-support applications and other services that meet the needs of a variety of types of users, including consumers, physicians and other healthcare professionals, with a variety of reasons for seeking information. Our ability to do so depends, in turn, on:\n\u2022\nour ability to hire and retain qualified authors, journalists and independent writers and healthcare professionals;\n\u2022\nour ability to license quality content from third parties; and\n\u2022\nour ability to monitor and respond to increases and decreases in user interest in specific topics.\nIf consumers and healthcare professionals do not perceive our content, applications and tools to be useful, reliable and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement with our health information services. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to develop or acquire needed content, applications and tools at a reasonable cost. In addition, since consumers may be attracted to The WebMD Health Network as a result of a specific condition or for a specific purpose, it is difficult for us to predict the rate at which they will return. Because we generate revenue by, among other things, selling sponsorships of specific pages, sections or events on The WebMD Health Network, a decline in user traffic levels or a reduction in the number of pages viewed by users could cause our advertising and sponsorship revenue to decrease and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, overall traffic to The WebMD Health Network does not have a direct correlation to our advertising and sponsorship revenue, which can continue to grow even if overall traffic remains constant or goes down. Our ability to generate advertising and sponsorship revenue depends primarily on our ability to create content on specific topics and to program various parts of The WebMD Health Network to build and maintain traffic in areas most important to both our audience and our advertising and sponsorship clients. If we are unable to do that, our advertising and sponsorship revenue could decrease even if our overall traffic remains the same or increases.\nA significant portion of the traffic to The WebMD Health Network is directed to us through algorithmic search results on Internet search engines and, if we are listed less prominently in search result listings or our traffic from search is otherwise reduced, our business and operating results could be harmed\nA significant portion of the traffic to The WebMD Health Network is directed to us through the algorithmic search results on Internet search engines. In addition to providing quality content and tools, we seek to produce and deliver our content and tools in ways that will cause them to rank well in algorithmic search engine results, which makes it more likely that search engine users will visit our Websites. This is commonly referred to as search engine optimization, or SEO. However, there can be no assurance that our SEO efforts will succeed in\nIndex to Financial Statements\nimproving the ranking of our content or, even if they do result in such improvement, that the improved ranking will result in increased numbers of users and page views for our Websites. In addition, search engines frequently change the criteria that determine site rankings in their search results or make other changes and our SEO efforts may not be successful if we do not respond to those changes appropriately and on a timely basis. Search engine providers may also prioritize search results generated by certain types of queries, including health-related queries, based on criteria they select, which could, in some circumstances, reduce the ranking that would otherwise be provided to our Websites and increase the ranking of other sites. If we are unable to respond effectively to changes made by search engine providers in their algorithms and other processes or to respond effectively to other factors and challenges that may impair our ability to attract traffic through search, a substantial decrease in traffic to The WebMD Health Network could occur, which could cause our revenue to decrease and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We cannot predict if, or how long, efforts to improve SEO or otherwise increase traffic may take to mitigate any such declines.\nSearch engine providers also typically display, together with algorithmic search results, content and links that may divert traffic from the pages referenced in the algorithmic search results, including: advertisements that are presented with the algorithmic search results for which the search engine provider receives compensation (sometimes referred to as paid search results); and health-related or other content and links that the search engine provider selects and displays in response to the specific search queries in a format determined by the search engine provider. Accordingly, even if we rank highly in algorithmic search results, traffic to our Websites may be reduced as a result of paid search results and other content included on the search results page generated by a search query. We cannot control the amount, quality or presentation of such paid search results and other content and, accordingly, we cannot predict any reductions in our traffic that may occur from time to time as search engine providers make changes in their policies and procedures regarding paid search results or regarding any other content they provide. In addition, to the extent that there is a reduction in the total volume of health-related searches on Internet search engines, traffic to The WebMD Health Network could also be reduced and we may have little or no ability to take steps to mitigate the effect on our traffic. In addition, we have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, declines in traffic to The WebMD Health Network from search for reasons that we are unable to identify. Any resulting reduction in our traffic for any of the reasons described above, if significant, could cause our revenue to decrease and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain successful monetization strategies for smartphone traffic, our financial results could be adversely affected\nThe number of people, including the number of physicians and other healthcare professionals, who access online content and services through smartphones has increased rapidly and is expected to continue to increase. Accordingly, the portion of our page views from smartphones has increased rapidly and is expected to continue to increase. The monetization of smartphone page views can be challenging because of the smaller screen size. If we are unable to maintain successful monetization strategies for smartphone traffic, our financial results could be negatively affected.\nOur initiative to provide content in online locations outside The WebMD Health Network may not increase our audience and, even if it does, may not be profitable\nWe are in the process of working to enable users to more easily discover, share and interact with content from WebMD not just on our Websites but also in other online locations and, in support of this initiative, we are creating new content offerings tailored for specific social networks and platforms and building our capabilities to create video content. If we are not successful in creating content offerings that support this initiative, our ability to compete for advertising and sponsorship revenue may be reduced. Even if we are successful in creating such content offerings and users respond favorably, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately monetize audience usage of such content or to drive sufficient traffic to our own Websites to make this initiative profitable.\nIndex to Financial Statements We face significant competition for our healthcare information products and services\nThe markets for healthcare information products and services are intensely competitive, continually evolving and, in some cases, subject to rapid change.\n\u2022\nThe WebMD Health Network faces competition from numerous other companies, both in attracting users and in generating revenue from advertisers and sponsors. We compete for users with Websites and mobile applications that provide health-related information, including both commercial ones and not-for-profit ones. We compete for advertisers and sponsors with: health-related Websites and mobile applications; general interest consumer Websites that offer specialized health sub-channels or functions; other high-traffic Websites that include both healthcare-related and non-healthcare-related content and services, including social media Websites; search engines; and advertising networks that aggregate traffic from multiple sites. The WebMD Health Network also faces competition from: traditional media and offline publications and information services; and manufacturers and distributors of activity trackers, heart rate monitors, blood pressure monitors and similar devices relating to health and wellness that can download data to a PC, tablet or smartphone, as well as numerous other companies developing applications and tools for use with those devices.\n\u2022\nOur WebMD Health Services platform and related services, including health coaching and condition management services compete with: providers of online health management applications, including personal health records; wellness and disease management vendors; and competing services provided by health insurance companies, employee benefits services companies, and their affiliates. Employers may also decide to develop similar solutions for their own populations rather than obtaining solutions from WebMD Health Services or its competitors.\nMany of our competitors have greater financial, technical, product development, marketing and other resources than we do. These organizations may be better known than we are and may have more customers or users than we do. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against these organizations. In addition, we expect that competitors will continue to enter these markets. The competition we face for our services may result in fewer or smaller customer commitments or pressure to reduce prices, which could reduce our profit margins.\nDeveloping and implementing new and updated services may be more difficult than expected and may not result in sufficient increases in revenue to justify the costs\nIn order to attract and retain users of our Websites and mobile applications and clients for our WebMD Health Services platform and related services, we must continue to improve the technology underlying our services and continue to develop new and updated offerings. If we are unable to do so on a timely basis or if we are unable to implement new offerings without disruption to our existing ones, we may lose potential users and clients.\nWe rely on a combination of internal development, strategic relationships, licensing and acquisitions to develop our Websites, mobile applications and related features and services. Our development and/or implementation of new technologies, features and services may cost more than expected, may take longer than originally expected, may require more testing than originally anticipated and may require the acquisition of additional personnel and other resources. There can be no assurance that the revenue opportunities from any new or updated technologies, applications, features or services will justify the amounts spent.\nFailure to effectively identify, assess and pursue new business initiatives could adversely affect our company and its prospects\nWe are working to broaden our portfolio of services and taking steps to diversify our client base and revenue streams. The development of new products and services in response to evolving trends in healthcare and evolving technologies for Internet-based and mobile services, as well as the identification of new business opportunities in this dynamic environment, requires significant time and resources. We may not be able to respond quickly enough or in a cost-effective manner, appropriately time the introduction of new products and\nIndex to Financial Statements\nservices to the market or identify new business opportunities in a timely manner. In addition, while evolving technologies may offer new opportunities, they may also present additional challenges, including challenges relating to security and privacy.\nSome of the business initiatives we are working on have challenges that are different from those associated with our existing products and services and could strain our financial, operational and management resources. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the potential revenue streams from any investments that we may make in pursuing new business opportunities will justify the amounts spent. Failure to effectively identify, assess and pursue new business initiatives may adversely affect our company and its prospects.\nFailure to continue to enhance the analytic capabilities we use to demonstrate the value of our services to advertisers and sponsors could adversely affect our ability to market our services\nWe continue to work to enhance the analytic capabilities we use to demonstrate to advertisers and sponsors how promotional strategies implemented through The WebMD Health Network impact physician and consumer behaviors and preferences. Our ability to demonstrate the value of advertising and sponsorship on The WebMD Health Network depends, in part, on our ability to provide accurate and reliable analytics and measurement capabilities and to continue to improve such capabilities. If we are unable to demonstrate such analytic capabilities, it could adversely affect our ability to market our services or to satisfy client expectations and commitments that rely on analytics to measure performance and, as a result, we may lose business to competitors even if our advertising and sponsorship services are superior to theirs.\nRestrictions on our ability to access or use various forms and sources of data could adversely impact our business\nWe are increasingly using data analytics based on information that we collect regarding usage of The WebMD Health Network, as well as other third-party sources of data. Our use of data regarding users of The WebMD Health Network is governed by the privacy policies posted on those sites and is designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations as is our use of any third-party data. In addition, we sell certain information products and services on a stand-alone basis using de-identified data that we license from a small number of third-party data sources, of which the principal source is a license from Change Healthcare to HLTH Corporation (HLTH). As the successor to HLTH, this license provides us the rights to certain de-identified data from Change Healthcare through early February 2018 for use in the development and commercialization of various information products and services as to which we pay Change Healthcare a royalty. To date, these stand-alone information products and services do not include any data derived from the operation of our Websites. We are seeking to acquire additional third-party data sources and to develop data generated from our Website operations in order to diversify our data product offerings.\nOur revenue from the stand-alone products and services that utilize data under the current Change Healthcare license is highly profitable and is reported net of the royalties and commissions that we pay to Change Healthcare or others. We do not expect that the current license agreement with Change Healthcare will continue after February 2018, and expect that if such agreement is renewed or is replaced with new third-party data sources, the terms of any such renewal or replacement license would not be as favorable to us as those in the current agreement. Change Healthcare is in the process of merging with McKesson Corporation and, as a result, discussions around extending our agreement with Change Healthcare have stalled. We are exploring other sources of third-party data and uses of our first party data to generate additional revenue streams, but we are early in that process. Accordingly, we expect that the sales of, and the profits generated by, our information services business will be materially adversely affected by the expiration, in early February 2018, of our license agreement with Change Healthcare.\nChanges to our ability to access or use data could adversely affect our ability to implement improved analytics or to offer information products on a stand-alone basis. Accordingly, our business could be adversely impacted if, for any reason (including, but not limited to, changes in applicable laws and regulations) the data we use becomes unavailable or the conditions on its availability are not commercially reasonable or are inconsistent with our planned usage. In addition, the quality of our data analytics depends on the reliability of the information\nIndex to Financial Statements\nthat we are able to obtain. If the information we use contains errors or is otherwise unreliable, analyses we create and actions we take based on those analyses could be wrong, which could hurt our reputation and business.\nFailure to maintain and enhance the \u201cWebMD\u201d and \u201cMedscape\u201d brands and our other brands could have a material adverse effect on our business\nWe believe that the \u201cWebMD\u201d and \u201cMedscape\u201d brand identities that we have developed have contributed to the success of our business and have helped us achieve recognition as a trusted source of health and wellness information and tools for consumers and of online content for physicians and other healthcare professionals. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing those brands, as well as our other brands, is important to expanding the user base for The WebMD Health Network and to our relationships with sponsors and advertisers. The \u201cWebMD\u201d brand is also important to our ability to gain additional employer and healthcare payer clients for our WebMD Health Services platform and related services. We have expended considerable resources on establishing and enhancing the \u201cWebMD\u201d and \u201cMedscape\u201d brands and our other brands, and we have developed policies and procedures designed to preserve and enhance our brands, including editorial procedures designed to provide quality control of the information we publish. We expect to continue to devote resources and efforts to maintain and enhance our brands. However, we may not be able to successfully maintain or enhance our brands, and events outside of our control may have a negative effect on our brands. If we are unable to maintain or enhance our brands, and do so in a cost-effective manner, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe markets we participate in are relatively new and continue to change\nWe participate in relatively new markets. These markets, and our business, have undergone significant changes during their short history and can be expected to continue to change. Many companies with business plans based on providing healthcare information and related services online and through mobile platforms have failed to be profitable and some have filed for bankruptcy or ceased operations. Even if demand from users exists, we cannot assure you that our business will be profitable.\nThe standards that our advertising and sponsorship clients apply to our services continue to evolve, including standards for ad delivery, placement and frequency and for measuring the effectiveness of our services as compared to other alternatives available to our clients. Our ability to meet such standards as they change in the future will be important to our ability to compete for business, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to do so or estimate what the costs for doing so may be. For example, standards are continuing to evolve in the online advertising marketplace regarding the viewability of online advertising, or the length of time an advertisement is visible to a user as determined by a third-party verification source. We cannot predict how the requirements of advertisers will continue to evolve. If we fail to meet the standards that our advertisers require, our advertising revenues could be reduced.\nOur failure to attract and retain qualified executives and employees may have a material adverse effect on our business\nOur business depends largely on the skills, experience and performance of key members of our management team and other key employees. We also depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified writers and editors, software developers and other technical personnel, healthcare professionals, and sales and marketing personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the healthcare information services and Internet industries is intense. We cannot assure you that we will be able to hire or retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel to meet our requirements, or that we will be able to do so at costs that are acceptable to us. Failure to do so may have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur advertising and sponsorship revenue may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and its amount and timing may be subject to factors beyond our control, including regulatory changes\nOur advertising and sponsorship revenue may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are not within our control, and some of which may be difficult to forecast accurately, including potential effects on demand for our services as a result of regulatory changes affecting advertising and\nIndex to Financial Statements\npromotion of drugs and medical devices and general economic conditions. The majority of our advertising and sponsorship programs are for terms of approximately four to twelve months. We have relatively few longer term advertising and sponsorship programs. We cannot assure you that our current advertisers and sponsors will continue to use our services beyond the terms of their existing commitments or that they will enter into any additional commitments.\nThe time between the date of initial contact with a potential advertiser or sponsor regarding a specific program and the execution of a commitment with the advertiser or sponsor for that program, as well as the additional time period before our services are delivered, may be longer than expected, especially for medium-sized and larger contracts, and may be subject to delays over which we have little or no control, including as a result of budgetary constraints of the advertiser or sponsor or their need for internal approvals, including internal approvals relating to compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to the marketing of healthcare products. We have experienced, from time to time, a lengthening of this internal review process by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, which has resulted in delays in contracting as well as delays in recognizing expected revenue under executed commitments. Other factors that could affect the timing of contracting for specific programs with advertisers and sponsors, or receipt of revenue under such contracts, include the timing of:\n\u2022\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for new products or for new indications or uses for approved products;\n\u2022\nany adverse determinations by the FDA affecting products previously approved or expected to be approved or the permitted uses of such products or their marketing;\n\u2022\nFDA approval of generic products that compete with existing brand name products and any increase in the number or significance of such approvals;\n\u2022\nrecalls, withdrawals or shortages of products from the market;\n\u2022\nconsolidation of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries;\n\u2022\nrollouts of new or enhanced services on The WebMD Health Network;\n\u2022\nseasonal factors relating to the prevalence of specific health conditions and other seasonal factors that may affect the timing of promotional campaigns for specific products; and\n\u2022\nthe scheduling of conferences for physicians and other healthcare professionals.\nSome of our pharmaceutical company customers have experienced patent expirations for certain of their products in the past several years and some are expected to experience patent expirations over the next several years. In the pharmaceutical industry, patent expirations allow for competition from lower-priced generic versions of the patented drugs and generally result in the termination of marketing efforts for the drug (unless the FDA awards regulatory exclusivities beyond the patent term). In addition, expirations of patents that result in a significant reduction in revenue for a pharmaceutical company can lead to reductions in their advertising and sponsorship expenditures for other drugs in their product portfolios or for their entire product portfolio.\nApplications and other software that can block advertisements could reduce demand for our advertising and sponsorship products and decrease our revenue\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from advertising and sponsorship on The WebMD Health Network. Applications and software are available that can block or obscure the display of advertisements or block the cookies used to deliver such advertisements, or shift the location in which advertising appears on pages. While the use of ad-blocking programs by visitors to The WebMD Health Network has been limited to date and our audience consists primarily of individuals who have not typically adopted ad-blocking programs so far, if these programs gain acceptance among our users in the future, they could reduce our ability to deliver advertisements to our audience which, in turn, could reduce demand for our advertising and sponsorship products and cause our revenue from those products to decrease.\nIndex to Financial Statements Mergers and acquisitions among our clients may reduce the volume of our services purchased by the consolidated company following such a transaction, which could harm our operating results\nMergers and acquisitions among our pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device company clients have in the past and could in the future reduce the number of our clients and potential clients. Similarly, mergers and acquisitions among health insurance company clients of our WebMD Health Services platform could reduce the number of those clients. In addition, when companies consolidate, the number of vendors used for services, or the amount spent, by the separate companies may be reduced by the consolidated entity and some vendors and services may no longer be used at all. Any such event could have a negative effect on our revenue and profitability and we cannot provide assurance that we would be able to mitigate any such negative effect.\nWe may be unsuccessful in our efforts to generate advertising and sponsorship revenue from consumer products companies\nMuch of our advertising and sponsorship revenue has, in the past, come from pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies. We also seek to generate advertising and sponsorship revenue from consumer products companies that are interested in communicating health-related or safety-related information about their products to our audience. However, while many consumer products companies are increasing the portion of their promotional spending used on the Internet, we cannot assure you that these advertisers and sponsors will find our consumer Websites to be as effective for promoting their products and services as competing channels, which include traditional media, Internet search engines, social media Internet sites, general interest consumer sites, and numerous other alternatives. Competition for this business may also result in smaller customer commitments or pressure to reduce prices, both of which could reduce our profit margins even if we are able to generate revenue.\nIn addition, revenues from consumer products companies are more likely to reflect general economic conditions, and to be reduced to a greater extent during economic downturns, than revenues from pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies. Accordingly, revenues from this portion of our business may be subject to significant quarter-to-quarter variations and we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to develop it further.\nLengthy sales and implementation cycles for our WebMD Health Services platform and certain contractual rights of our clients make it difficult to forecast our revenues and may have an adverse impact on our results of operations\nThe period from our initial contact with a potential client for our WebMD Health Services platform and entry into a contract for a subscription to our solution by the client is difficult to predict. In the past, this period has generally ranged from six to twelve months, but in some cases has been longer. Potential contracts may be subject to delays or cancellations due to a client\u2019s internal procedures for approving large expenditures and other factors beyond our control, including the effect of general economic conditions on the willingness of potential clients to subscribe to our WebMD Health Services solution. The time it takes to implement our WebMD Health Services platform is also difficult to predict and has lasted as long as six months from contract execution to the commencement of live operation. Implementation may be subject to delays based on the availability of the internal resources of the client that are needed and other factors outside of our control. As a result, we have limited ability to forecast the timing of revenue from clients. This, in turn, makes it more difficult to forecast our financial performance for future periods and may have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nDuring the contracting cycle and the implementation period, we may expend substantial time, effort and money preparing contract proposals, negotiating contracts and implementing our WebMD Health Services platform without receiving any related revenue. In addition, many of the expenses related to providing our platform are relatively fixed in the short term, including personnel costs and technology and infrastructure costs. If our health services revenue is lower than expected, we may not be able to reduce related short-term spending in response. Any shortfall in such revenue would have a direct impact on our results of operations.\nIn addition, some of our client contracts permit termination, by the client, prior to the end of the stated contract term for some or all of the services to be provided, which can make it more difficult to forecast our future financial performance and may have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nIndex to Financial Statements Our ability to renew existing agreements with employers and health plans will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to develop and update our offerings and to increase usage of our services by their employees and plan members\nIn a healthcare market where a greater share of the responsibility for healthcare costs and decision-making has been shifting to consumers, use of information technology (including personal health records) to assist consumers in making informed decisions about healthcare has also increased. We believe that through our WebMD Health Services platform as well as our health coaching programs and our targeted condition management programs, we are well positioned to play a role in this environment. However, our strategy depends, in part, on increasing usage of our services by our employer and health plan clients\u2019 employees and plan participants and being able to demonstrate a sufficient return on investment and other benefits for our clients from those services. Increasing usage of our platform and related services requires us to continue to develop new and updated applications, features and services. In addition, there are numerous competitors for the services we provide, many of which have greater financial, technical, product development, marketing and other resources than we do, and may be better known than we are. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to meet our development and implementation goals or that we will be able to compete successfully against other vendors offering competitive services and, if we are unable to do so, we may experience static or diminished usage of our platform and related services, possible non-renewals of our customer agreements and, since some customers have the right to terminate or modify existing agreements before the end of the full contract term, possible terminations for some or all of the services to be provided.\nThe condition management programs that we provide to clients of our WebMD Health Services platform involve risk and challenges with which we have limited experience and may not be profitable\nWe provide condition management services to clients of our WebMD Health Services platform and plan to continue to expand that portion of our business. Our current offerings include programs targeting individuals struggling with coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. Our condition management programs include ongoing, intensive one-on-one coaching by condition specialists, along with targeted online resources and progress tracking tools. Providing condition management services involves new risks and challenges for us, including: potential requirements to obtain and retain licenses, permits and regulatory clearances and approvals related to these services; difficulty in quantifying the costs savings and other benefits for our clients from these services; and difficulty in differentiating our condition management services from those of competitors, some of whom may be able to provide such services at a lower cost. We cannot predict the demand among our existing WebMD Health Services clients and other potential clients for our condition management services and cannot provide assurance that the revenue opportunities from providing our current offerings or ones for additional conditions will justify the costs involved in maintaining or developing the required capabilities and delivering the services to clients.\nContractual relationships with governmental customers may impose special burdens on us and provide special benefits to those customers, including the right to change or terminate the contract in response to budgetary constraints or policy changes\nA portion of our revenues come from customers that are governmental agencies or vendors to such agencies. Government contracts and subcontracts may be subject to some or all of the following:\n\u2022\ntermination when appropriated funding for the current fiscal year is exhausted or becomes unavailable;\n\u2022\ntermination for the governmental customer\u2019s convenience, subject to a negotiated settlement for costs incurred and profit on work completed, along with the right to place contracts out for bid before the full contract term, as well as the right to make unilateral changes in contract requirements, subject to negotiated price adjustments;\n\u2022\n\u201cmost-favored\u201d pricing disclosure requirements that are designed to ensure that the government can negotiate and receive pricing akin to that offered commercially and requirements to submit proprietary cost or pricing data to ensure that government contract pricing is fair and reasonable;\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u2022\ncommercial customer price tracking requirements that require contractors to monitor pricing offered to a specified class of customers and to extend price reductions offered to that class of customers to the government;\n\u2022\nreporting and compliance requirements related to, among other things: equal employment opportunity, affirmative action for veterans and for workers with disabilities, and accessibility for the disabled;\n\u2022\nbroader audit rights than we would usually grant to non-governmental customers; and\n\u2022\nspecialized remedies for breach and default or failure to meet service level commitments, including setoff rights, retroactive price adjustments, and civil or criminal fraud penalties, as well as mandatory administrative dispute resolution procedures instead of state contract law remedies.\nIn addition, certain violations of federal law may subject government contractors to having their contracts terminated and, under certain circumstances, suspension and/or debarment from future government contracts.\nExpansion to markets outside the United States subjects us to additional risks\nOne element of our growth strategy is to seek to expand our online services to markets outside the United States. In certain markets outside the United States, we expect to accomplish this through partnerships or joint ventures with other companies having expertise in the specific country or region, while in other such markets we expect to rely primarily on our own internal resources. In certain markets outside of the United States, we are providing some of our online services in the local language directly to healthcare professionals. We also provide our online services in English to healthcare professionals outside the United States. Our participation in international markets is subject to certain risks beyond those applicable to our operations in the United States, such as:\n\u2022\nchallenges caused by cultural differences;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing operations from a distance;\n\u2022\nuncertainty regarding liability for services and content;\n\u2022\npotential burdens of complying with a wide variety of legal, regulatory and market requirements, as well as uncertainty as to the applicability of non-U.S. laws to operations based in the United States and regarding the interpretation of such laws by local authorities;\n\u2022\npotential regulation or interpretation of existing regulation that could limit or eliminate our ability to distribute one or more of our products in one or more countries;\n\u2022\nvariability of economic and political conditions, including the extent of the impact of adverse economic conditions in markets outside the United States;\n\u2022\nexposure to applicable anti-corruption laws, including but not limited to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022\ntariffs or other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on repatriation of earnings; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in protecting intellectual property.\nIn addition, outside the United States, we face competition from locally based companies that have experience doing business in their home countries or regions and familiarity with local business practices, customs and laws and, as a result, generally do not face, or are better positioned to face, the risks described above.\nIndex to Financial Statements Risks Related to the Internet and Our Technological Infrastructure\nAny service interruption or failure in the systems that we use to provide online services could harm our business\nOur online services are designed to operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, without interruption. However, we have experienced and expect that we will in the future experience interruptions and delays in services and availability from time to time. We rely on internal systems as well as third-party vendors, including data center providers, bandwidth providers and mobile carriers, to provide our online services. We may not maintain redundant systems or facilities for some of these services. In the event of a catastrophic event with respect to one or more of these systems or facilities, we may experience an extended period of system unavailability, which could negatively impact our relationship with users. In addition, system failures may result in loss of data, including user registration data, business intelligence data, content, and other data critical to the operation of our online services, which could cause significant harm to our business and our reputation.\nTo operate without interruption or loss of data, both we and our service providers must guard against:\n\u2022\ndamage from fire, power loss and other natural disasters;\n\u2022\ncommunications failures;\n\u2022\nsoftware and hardware errors, failures and crashes;\n\u2022\nsecurity breaches, computer viruses, distributed denial-of-service attacks and similar disruptive problems; and\n\u2022\nother potential service interruptions.\nAny disruption in the network access or co-location services provided by third-party providers to us or any failure by these third-party providers or our own systems to handle current or higher volume of use could significantly harm our business. We exercise little control over these third-party vendors, which increases our vulnerability to problems with services they provide. Any errors, failures, interruptions or delays experienced in connection with these third-party technologies and information services or our own systems could negatively impact our relationships with users and adversely affect our brand and our business and could expose us to liabilities to third parties. Although we maintain insurance for our business, the coverage under our policies may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost.\nFailure to update our technology infrastructure could adversely affect our business\nEvolving technologies could require us to modify our technology infrastructure and any failure to do so on a timely basis may limit the types of services we can provide or the quality of those services, and may put us in a weaker position relative to our competitors. Competitors with newer technology infrastructure may also have greater flexibility and be in a position to respond more quickly than us to new opportunities, which may impact our competitive position in certain markets and adversely affect our business.\nImplementation of updates to our technology infrastructure may result in performance problems and may not provide the additional functionality that was expected\nFrom time to time, we implement additions to or changes in the hardware and software platforms we use for providing our online services. During and after the implementation of additions or changes, a platform may not perform as expected, which could result in interruptions in operations, an increase in response time or an inability to track performance metrics. In addition, in connection with integrating acquired businesses, we may move their operations to our hardware and software platforms or make other changes, any of which could result in interruptions in those operations. Any significant interruption in our ability to operate any of our online services could have an adverse effect on our relationships with users and clients and, as a result, on our financial results. We rely on a combination of purchasing, licensing, internal development, and acquisitions to develop our hardware and software platforms. Our implementation of additions to or changes in these platforms may cost\nIndex to Financial Statements\nmore than originally expected, may take longer than originally expected, and may require more testing than originally anticipated. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that additions to or changes in these platforms will provide the additional functionality and other benefits that were originally expected.\nIf the systems we use to provide our online services experience security breaches or are otherwise perceived to be insecure, our business could suffer\nWe retain and transmit confidential information, including personal health records, in the processing centers and other facilities we use to provide our online services. It is critical that these facilities and infrastructure remain secure and be perceived by the marketplace as secure. A security breach could damage our reputation or result in liability. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches and hackers or to alleviate problems caused by breaches. Despite the implementation of security measures, this infrastructure or other systems that we interface with, including the Internet and related systems, may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, hackers, improper employee or contractor access, computer viruses, programming errors, denial-of-service attacks or other attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems. Because the techniques used by hackers to sabotage or to obtain unauthorized access to computer systems change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate specific types of attacks or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users, customers, advertisers or publishers. Any compromise of our security, whether as a result of breaches or failures of our own systems or the systems with which they interface, could reduce demand for our services and could subject us to legal claims from our clients and users, including for breach of contract or breach of warranty.\nOur online services are dependent on the development and maintenance of the Internet infrastructure\nOur ability to deliver our online services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the Internet by third parties. The Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure, and it could face outages and delays in the future. The Internet has also experienced, and is likely to continue to experience, significant growth in the number of users and the amount of traffic. If the Internet continues to experience increased usage, the Internet infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it. In addition, the reliability and performance of the Internet may be harmed by increased usage or by denial-of-service attacks. Any resulting interruptions in our services or increases in response time could, if significant, result in a loss of potential or existing users of and advertisers and sponsors on our Websites and, if sustained or repeated, could reduce the attractiveness of our services.\nCustomers who utilize our online services depend on Internet service providers and other Website operators for access to our Websites. Many of these providers have experienced significant outages in the past and they could experience outages, delays and other difficulties in the future due to system failures unrelated to our systems. Any such outages or other failures on their part could reduce traffic to our Websites.\nThird parties may challenge the enforceability of our online agreements\nThe law governing the validity and enforceability of online agreements and other electronic transactions is evolving. We could be subject to claims by third parties that the online terms and conditions for use of our Websites, including disclaimers or limitations of liability, are unenforceable. A finding by a court that these terms and conditions or other online agreements are invalid could harm our business.\nWe could be subject to breach of warranty or other claims by clients of our online services if the software and systems we use to provide them contain errors or experience failures\nErrors in the software and systems we use could cause serious problems for clients of our online services. We may fail to meet contractual performance standards or client expectations. Clients of our online services may seek compensation from us or may seek to terminate their agreements with us, withhold payments due to us, seek refunds from us of part or all of the fees charged under those agreements or initiate litigation or other dispute resolution procedures. In addition, we could face breach of warranty or other claims by clients, or additional\nIndex to Financial Statements\ndevelopment costs. Our software and systems are inherently complex and, despite testing and quality control, we cannot be certain that they will perform as planned.\nWe attempt to limit, by contract, our liability to our clients for damages arising from our negligence, errors or mistakes. However, contractual limitations on liability may not be enforceable in certain circumstances or may otherwise not provide sufficient protection to us from liability for damages. We maintain liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors and omissions. However, it is possible that claims could exceed the amount of our applicable insurance coverage, if any, or that this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts. Even if these claims do not result in liability to us, investigating and defending against them would be expensive and time consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention away from our operations. In addition, negative publicity caused by these events may delay or hinder market acceptance of our services, including unrelated services.\nRisks Related to the Healthcare Industry, Healthcare Regulation and Internet Regulation\nDevelopments in the healthcare industry that reduce spending by healthcare industry participants generally could adversely affect our business\nOur business could be adversely impacted by changes in the structure of the healthcare industry and other changes that reduce healthcare spending. We are particularly dependent on pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies for our advertising and sponsorship revenue. General reductions in expenditures by healthcare industry participants could result from, among other things:\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulation or private initiatives that affect the manner in which healthcare industry participants interact with patients, payers (including governmental payers) or other healthcare industry participants, including any such regulations or initiatives that seek to control the pricing or means of delivery of healthcare products and services or that create restrictions on the advertising or promotion of healthcare products and services;\n\u2022\nconsolidation of healthcare industry participants;\n\u2022\nreductions in governmental funding for healthcare; and\n\u2022\nadverse changes in business or economic conditions affecting healthcare payers or providers, pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical device companies or other healthcare industry participants.\nDevelopments in the healthcare industry that reduce spending in the specific market segments that we participate in could adversely affect our business\nEven if overall expenditures by industry participants remain the same or increase, developments in the healthcare industry may result in reduced spending in some or all of the specific market segments that we serve or are planning to serve. For example, use of our products and services could be affected by:\n\u2022\nchanges in the design of health insurance plans or governmental programs that pay for healthcare products and services;\n\u2022\nthe timing of FDA (or European or other national regulatory authority) approvals for new products or for new approved indications or uses for existing products and any decrease in the number or significance of new drugs or medical devices coming to market or new approved uses for existing products;\n\u2022\nthe timing of FDA (or European or other national regulatory authority) approvals of generic products that compete with existing brand name products and any increase in the number or significance of such approvals or of withdrawals of brand name products from the market;\n\u2022\nthe timing of FDA (or European or other national regulatory authority) approvals of biosimilars to approved biological products and any increase in the number or significance of such approvals or of withdrawals of biological products from the market; and\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u2022\ndecreases in marketing expenditures by pharmaceutical or medical device companies, including as a result of governmental regulation or private initiatives that discourage, restrict or prohibit advertising, sponsorship or educational activities by pharmaceutical or medical device companies or that discourage, restrict or prohibit their use of online services for some or all such activities.\nIn addition, our customers\u2019 expectations regarding pending or potential industry developments may also affect their budgeting processes and spending plans with respect to products and services of the types we provide. Since 2016, there has been increasing scrutiny regarding pricing increases for pharmaceutical products, which could lead to additional regulation of pharmaceutical pricing or other changes in how those products are distributed and the roles played by various industry participants in that distribution. We cannot predict the effect that such scrutiny or any resulting changes may have on the marketing plans of our customers in future periods or their future use of our services.\nThe healthcare industry has changed significantly in recent years, and we expect that significant changes will continue to occur. However, the timing and impact of developments in the healthcare industry are difficult to predict. We cannot assure you that the markets for our products and services will continue to exist at current levels or that we will have adequate technical, financial and marketing resources to react to changes in those markets.\nChanges to the Affordable Care Act and other healthcare reform efforts could affect some of our healthcare industry customers and clients\nPolitical, economic, regulatory and enforcement influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the U.S. to fundamental changes. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact the various healthcare entities with which we contract. In particular, we anticipate that the U.S. Executive Branch, U.S. Congress, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to consider and may adopt healthcare policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs, particularly given the ongoing scrutiny regarding healthcare pricing in the U.S. generally, and prescription drug pricing specifically. Such policies could limit the prices our advertisers and sponsors charge for their healthcare-related products or services, limit the commercial opportunities of our advertisers and sponsors and/or negatively impact revenues collected by our advertisers and sponsors. We are particularly dependent on our healthcare clients, which primarily include pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device companies, for our advertising and sponsorship revenue. Our advertisers and sponsors may face cost reduction measures and, in response, reduce their expenditures or postpone expenditure decisions, including expenditures for our services, which could have material adverse effects on our business.\nOne law in particular with a significant impact on the healthcare industry is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (which we refer to as the Affordable Care Act), which was signed into law in March 2010. The Affordable Care Act made extensive changes to the system of healthcare insurance and benefits in the U.S. While we do not currently anticipate any significant adverse effects on WebMD as a direct result of the application of the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as it may be amended, to our business or on our company in its capacity as an employer, we are unable to predict what the indirect impacts will be on WebMD\u2019s business through its effects on other healthcare industry participants, including pharmaceutical and medical device companies that are advertisers and sponsors of The WebMD Health Network and employers and health plans that license our WebMD Health Services platform. Healthcare industry participants may respond to the Affordable Care Act or to uncertainties created by the potential statutory and regulatory changes by reducing their expenditures or postponing expenditure decisions, including expenditures for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nGovernment regulation of healthcare creates risks and challenges with respect to our compliance efforts and our business strategies\nThe healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory and other influences. Existing and new laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry could create unexpected liabilities for us, could cause us to incur additional costs and could restrict our operations. Many healthcare laws are complex, and their application to specific products, services, and business arrangements may not be clear. In\nIndex to Financial Statements\nparticular, many existing healthcare laws and regulations, when enacted, did not anticipate the healthcare information services that we provide. However, these laws and regulations may nonetheless be applied to our products, services, and business arrangements. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations, or other failure to comply, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business. Even in areas where we are not subject to healthcare regulation directly, we may become involved in governmental actions or investigations through our relationships with customers that are regulated, and participation in such actions or investigations, even if we are not a party and not the subject of an investigation, may cause us to incur significant expenses. Some of the risks we face from healthcare regulation are as follows:\n\u2022\nU.S. Regulation of Drug and Medical Device Advertising and Promotion. The WebMD Health Network provides services involving advertising and promotion of prescription and over-the-counter drugs and medical devices and claims of nutritional supplements. If the FDA or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) finds that any of our products and services or any information on The WebMD Health Network, in our mobile applications, or in WebMD Magazine violates applicable regulations and guidance documents, they may take regulatory or judicial action against us and/or the advertiser or sponsor of that information. State attorneys general may take similar action based on their respective states\u2019 consumer protection statutes. Any increase or change in regulation of drug or medical device advertising and promotion, especially if it relates to promotional activities involving the Internet or social media, could make it more difficult for us to contract for sponsorships and advertising and could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. We cannot predict how our customers or others in the industry might implement regulations or guidance in the future or how its implementation might affect our business. Private industry initiatives have resulted in voluntary restrictions, which advertisers and sponsors have agreed to follow.\nIn December 2016, Congress passed the 21st Century Cures Act (the Cures Act) which contained a number of provisions designed to speed development of innovative therapies, to provide public science funding, and to adjust how the FDA evaluates new medical products and new indications for existing prescription drugs and devices. We cannot predict what effect, if any, the Cures Act might have on our business but we will closely monitor the changes.\n\u2022\nNon-U.S. Regulation of Drug and Medical Device Advertising and Promotion. To the extent that The WebMD Health Network reaches users outside of the United States, our Websites may be required to comply with the national laws of the respective countries whose users they address. In many countries, the advertising of prescription drugs to the general public is not allowed and, accordingly, these countries generally require access restrictions for Websites that contain such advertisements, which are only allowed to be addressed to healthcare professionals. In addition, there are laws and regulations regarding the use of indirect or disguised marketing, and regarding the offering and providing of gifts or benefits with promotional purpose that are not of minor value.\n\u2022\nAnti-Kickback Laws. There are federal and state laws that govern patient referrals, physician financial relationships and inducements to healthcare providers and patients. The federal anti-kickback law prohibits any person or entity from offering, paying, soliciting or receiving anything of value, directly or indirectly, in exchange for the referral of patients for items or services reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, or to induce or reward the leasing, purchasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the lease, purchase or order of any item, good, facility or service reimbursed by these programs. Many states and European countries also have similar anti-kickback laws that are not necessarily limited to items or services for which payment is made by a government healthcare program. These laws are applicable to any person or entity, including manufacturers and distributors and, therefore, may restrict how we and some of our customers market products to healthcare providers. We carefully review our practices with regulatory experts in an effort to ensure that we comply with all applicable laws. However, the laws in this area are both broad and vague, and it is often difficult or impossible to determine precisely how the laws will be applied, particularly to new services. Penalties for violating the federal anti-kickback law include imprisonment, fines and exclusion from participating, directly or indirectly, in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Any determination by\nIndex to Financial Statements\na state, federal, or foreign regulatory agency that any of our practices violate any of these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties and require us to change or terminate some portions of our business and could have an adverse effect on our business. Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our practices could cause us to incur significant costs or cause adverse publicity. In addition, enforcement or the potential for enforcement of these laws against some of our customers may influence the services we are able to offer and/or our customers\u2019 willingness to continue to use our services.\n\u2022\nFalse Claims Laws. The Federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a Federal healthcare program. The whistleblower (or \u201cqui tam\u201d) provisions of the Federal False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the Federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government and to share in any monetary recovery. After the filing of a qui tam suit, the Federal government may intervene and control the case; if it does not, the private individual may pursue the claim on his or her own. In addition, various states and European countries have enacted false claim laws analogous to the Federal False Claims Act, and many of these laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not merely a federal healthcare program. When an entity is determined to have violated the Federal False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government plus civil penalties. In recent years an increasing number of Federal False Claims Act cases have been brought against drug manufacturers and resulted in significant monetary settlements and imposition of federally supervised corporate integrity agreements in circumstances that include allegations that company-sponsored continuing medical education (or CME) was unlawful off-label promotion. It is not clear whether there is a basis for the application of the Federal False Claims Act to the types of services that WebMD provides. However, plaintiffs have in the past, and may in the future, seek to name us as defendants in these types of cases. Any action against us for violation of these laws could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. Similarly, False Claims Act actions and resulting corporate integrity agreements involving our customers may reduce the use of our services by our advertising and sponsorship clients.\n\u2022\nMedical Professional Regulation. The practice of most healthcare professions requires licensing under applicable state law. In addition, the laws in some states prohibit business entities from practicing medicine. If a state determines that some portion of our business violates these laws, it may seek to have us discontinue those portions or subject us to penalties or licensure requirements.\n\u2022\nRegulation of Mobile Medical Applications and Other Mobile Health Technology. The FDA has issued guidance regarding mobile medical applications and other mobile health technology, clarifying the agency\u2019s intent to regulate only those applications that meet the agency\u2019s definition of \u201cdevice\u201d and could pose a risk to patients\u2019 safety if they fail to work as intended. The FDA is exercising enforcement discretion with respect to certain lower risk mobile applications that meet the device definition, such as those that maintain or encourage a general state of health or a healthy activity. Mobile applications that do not meet the device definition are beyond the FDA\u2019s jurisdiction and, accordingly, are not subject to the agency\u2019s oversight. In February 2015, the FDA issued guidance stating it would refrain from exercising enforcement over certain products that promote health or healthy lifestyles that reduce the risk or impact of certain diseases or conditions. In light of FDA guidance, we believe that none of our existing online services and mobile applications are subject to regulation as a medical device under applicable FDA regulations. We are required to determine whether FDA regulations would apply to any of our applications and the FDA could disagree with our determination. It is also possible that products or services that we may offer in the future could subject us to such regulation or that current rules could change or be interpreted to apply to some of our existing online services or mobile applications. In addition, it is possible that our mobile health offerings could fall under the scope of the FTC Act or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009. In April 2016, the FTC released a web-based tool in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and Office for Civil\nIndex to Financial Statements\nRights (OCR), and the FDA, to help mobile application developers determine which federal privacy laws might apply to their applications. At the same time, the FTC released guidance aimed at mobile health developer compliance with the FTC Act. In February 2016, OCR posted guidance on its mHealth Developer Portal regarding scenarios in which HIPAA might apply to mobile health applications. Complying with such rules and regulations could be burdensome and expensive and could delay our introduction of new services or applications.\nWe may be subject to claims brought against us as a result of content we provide\nConsumers access health-related information through our online services, including information regarding particular medical conditions and possible adverse reactions or side effects from medications. Physicians and other healthcare professionals use our services to access clinical reference sources, commentary from leading medical experts, medical news, and coverage of professional meetings and conferences. If our content, or content we obtain from third parties, contains inaccuracies, it is possible that physicians, consumers, employees, health plan members or others may sue us for various causes of action. Although our Websites and mobile applications contain terms and conditions, including disclaimers of liability, that are intended to reduce or eliminate our liability, the law governing the validity and enforceability of online agreements and other electronic transactions is evolving. We could be subject to claims by third parties that our online agreements with consumers and physicians that provide the terms and conditions for use of our Websites and mobile applications are unenforceable. A finding by a court that these agreements are invalid and that we are subject to liability could harm our business and require costly changes to our business.\nWe have editorial procedures in place to provide quality control of the information that we publish or provide. However, we cannot assure you that our editorial and other quality control procedures will be sufficient to ensure that there are no errors or omissions in particular content. Even if potential claims do not result in liability to us, investigating and defending against these claims could be expensive and time-consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention away from our operations. In addition, our business is based on establishing the reputation of our Websites as trustworthy and dependable sources of healthcare information. Allegations of impropriety or inaccuracy, even if unfounded, could harm our reputation and business.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet could adversely affect our business\nThe Internet and its associated technologies are subject to various laws and government regulation. Our failure, or the failure of our business partners or third-party service providers, to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations to our products and services and the manner in which we deliver them, or any other failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business. In addition, new laws and regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may be adopted with respect to online services, including in areas such as user privacy, confidentiality, consumer protection, marketing, pricing, content, copyrights and patents, and characteristics and quality of products and services. For example, in 2015, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) altered a long-standing regulatory regime by classifying broadband Internet access services as common carrier telecommunications services. While this decision appears to most directly impact broadband Internet service providers, how associated FCC rulemakings may affect our business is difficult to predict.\nInternet and mobile user privacy, personal data security and the use of consumer information to track online activities are major issues both in the United States and abroad. The FTC and state attorneys general continue to pay close attention to Internet privacy issues and, under their current unfair or deceptive trade practices authority, have been active in investigating and entering into consent decrees with companies because of the online privacy and data security practices of those companies. The FTC\u2019s evolving privacy enforcement activities, as reflected in its workshops, reports and enforcement actions, may be relevant to services we offer. In the U.S., there is a possibility of new legislation and regulation and increased enforcement activities relating to privacy and behavioral advertising. In addition, changes in industry practice (whether on their own or when combined with regulatory changes) could adversely impact our ability to deliver advertisements based on online behavior. For example, it is possible that at some point in the future, it will be a common Internet practice for Websites to honor \u201cDo Not Track\u201d settings in Internet browsers that are turned on by default. Whether through industry\nIndex to Financial Statements\npractice or in combination with government regulation, such a development could limit our ability to serve advertisements to consumers based on online behavior on third-party sites or on our sites, which could adversely affect our revenue.\nIn Europe, Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council requires the user\u2019s full information and consent prior to the installation and use of any so-called \u201ccookie\u201d on a user\u2019s computer. This Directive has been implemented differently, if at all, in member states of the European Union and national requirements to remain compliant with the respective laws may vary. Nevertheless, the provisions of this directive, whether or not effectively implemented in national laws, are now applicable in all the member states of the European Union and enforcement actions are now being considered by local data protection authorities. In January 2017, the European Commission proposed a new EU-wide regulation to replace Directive 2009/136/EC, which if enacted, may impose new privacy requirements for electronic communications, including the use of \u201ccookies\u201d and similar technologies on a user\u2019s computer or mobile device.\nSeparately, under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a European-wide regulation that will be fully enforceable by May 25, 2018, various new requirements relating to Internet privacy will apply, including for users\u2019 consent for offline and online marketing. European privacy regulators will continue to publish guidance on GDPR requirements throughout 2017. In addition, the GDPR and recent case law in some European countries will increase the likelihood of the applicability of European law to entities established outside the European Union but processing data of European data subjects.\nWe have privacy policies posted on our Websites that we believe comply with existing applicable laws requiring notice to users about our information collection, use and disclosure practices. We also notify users about our information collection, use and disclosure practices relating to data we receive through offline means such as paper health risk assessments. Moreover, we take steps to reasonably protect certain sensitive personal information we hold. We cannot assure you that the privacy policies and other statements we provide to users of our products and services, or our practices, will sufficiently protect us from liability or adverse publicity in this area. A determination by a state or federal agency or court, or European data protection authority or competent court, that any of our practices do not meet applicable standards, or the implementation of new standards or requirements, including, but not limited to the GDPR or a new \u201ccookie\u201d regulation in the EU, could adversely affect our business.\nFailure to comply with laws relating to privacy and security of personal information, including personal health information, could result in liability to us, and concerns about privacy-related issues could damage our reputation and our business\nPrivacy and security of personal information stored or transmitted electronically, including personal health information, are a major issue in the United States and abroad. While we strive to comply with all applicable privacy and security laws and regulations, as well as our own posted privacy policies, legal standards for privacy (including, but not limited to, \u201cunfairness\u201d and \u201cdeception\u201d as enforced by the FTC and state attorneys general) continue to evolve, and any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in private party litigation against us or proceedings or actions against us by government entities, or could cause us to lose users and customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. There has recently been an increase in the number of privacy-related lawsuits filed against companies. In addition, we are unable to predict what additional legislation or regulation in the area of privacy of personal information, including personal health information, could be enacted and what effect that could have on our operations and business. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded and even if we are in compliance with applicable laws, could damage our reputation and harm our business.\nThe Privacy Standards and Security Standards under HIPAA establish a set of national privacy and security standards for the handling of protected health information by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers (referred to as \u201ccovered entities\u201d) and their \u201cbusiness associates,\u201d which are persons or entities that perform certain services for, or functions or activities on behalf of, a covered entity (or another business associate) that involve the creation, receipt, maintenance, or transmission of protected health information. Certain portions of our business, such as those managing employee or plan member health\nIndex to Financial Statements\ninformation for employers or health plans, are subject to HIPAA as business associates of covered entities. In addition to imposing privacy and security requirements, HIPAA also creates obligations for us to report any unauthorized acquisition, access, use or disclosure of protected health information, known as a breach, to our covered entity customers. The 2013 final HITECH rule modified the breach reporting standard in a manner that made more data security incidents qualify as reportable breaches. In addition, HITECH and its implementing regulations imposed similar data breach notification requirements on vendors of personal health records that require us to notify affected individuals, the FTC, and, in some cases, the media in the event of a data breach involving the unsecured personal information of users of The WebMD Health Network. Violations of HIPAA may result in civil and criminal penalties and could damage our reputation and harm our business. HITECH increased civil penalty amounts for violations of HIPAA and significantly strengthened enforcement by requiring HHS to conduct periodic audits to confirm compliance and authorizing state attorneys general to bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations of HIPAA Privacy Standards and Security Standards that threaten the privacy of state residents. In July 2016, OCR announced a new phase of the HIPAA Audit Program, which for the first time targets business associates. Audits may, in certain circumstances, lead to full compliance reviews - with the potential for civil or criminal penalties. We cannot assure you that we will adequately address the risks created by these amended HIPAA Privacy Standards and Security Standards. In addition, we are unable to predict what changes to these Standards might be made in the future or how those changes, or other changes in applicable laws and regulations, could affect our business.\nIn Europe, transfers of EU individuals\u2019 personal data from EU member states to countries not recognized as having adequate protections for personal data, which includes the U.S., are regulated by the Directive 95/46/EC and its national implementations. The U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework, previously used widely to legitimize transfers of personal data from the EU to the U.S, was declared invalid in 2015. On July 12, 2016, the European Commission adopted the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield to replace the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework. The Privacy Shield is intended to protect the fundamental rights of anyone in the EU whose personal data are transferred to the U.S. to a Privacy-Shield certified organization. U.S. companies that self-certify to meeting the requirements of the new framework, are required to among other things post a privacy policy on their Websites, and are required to reply promptly to any complaints. We are continuing to assess the need for, and form of any transfer mechanism we may use.\nCriminal sanctions in Europe for violations of national implementations of the data protection Directive 95/46/EC and of the e-Privacy Directive 2002/58/EC are rarely imposed, though national implementations provide for both criminal and administrative sanctions. For example, France provides for administrative fines of up to 3,000,000 Euros in case of illegal collection or processing of personally identifiable information. Under the General Data Protection Regulation, there will be fines of up to 10,000,000 Euros or up to 2% of the global sales for certain comparatively minor offenses, or up to 20,000,000 Euros or up to 4% of the global sales for more serious offenses.\nFailure to maintain CME accreditation could adversely affect Medscape, LLC\u2019s ability to provide online CME offerings\nMedscape, LLC\u2019s continuing education activities for physicians and other healthcare professionals are planned and implemented in accordance with the current Essential Areas and Elements and the Policies of the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (or ACCME), which oversees providers of CME credit, and other applicable accreditation standards. The ACCME\u2019s standards for commercial support of CME are intended to assure, among other things, that CME activities of ACCME-accredited providers, such as Medscape, LLC, are independent of \u201ccommercial interests,\u201d which are defined as entities that produce, market, re-sell or distribute healthcare goods and services, excluding certain organizations. Commercial interests and entities owned or controlled by commercial interests are ineligible for accreditation by the ACCME. Medscape, LLC\u2019s accreditation is a Joint Accreditation from the ACCME, the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (as a provider of continuing education for pharmacy) and the American Nurses Credentialing Center (as a provider of continuing education for nurses).\nMedscape, LLC\u2019s current ACCME accreditation expires in August 2022. If Medscape, LLC fails to maintain its status as an accredited ACCME provider (whether at the time of such renewal or at an earlier time as\nIndex to Financial Statements\na result of a failure to comply with existing or additional ACCME standards), it will not be permitted to certify CME activities for physicians and other healthcare professionals. Instead, Medscape, LLC would be required to use third parties to provide such CME-related services. That, in turn, could discourage potential supporters from engaging Medscape, LLC to develop CME activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nGovernment regulation and industry initiatives could adversely affect the volume of CME programming available on Medscape Education\nCME activities may be subject to government oversight or regulation by Congress, the FDA, HHS, and local regulatory authorities, both in the United States and abroad. Medscape, LLC, WebMD Global LLC and the financial supporters of their medical education activities may be subject to enforcement actions if any of these activities are deemed improperly promotional, potentially leading to the termination of financial support. Additionally, Supporters of CME activities could be affected by industry initiatives regarding funding for CME which may cause them to decrease funding for CME activities.\nGovernment authorities continue to examine pharmaceutical companies\u2019 financial support of CME including public reporting requirements as they relate to payments and transfers of value made to physician speakers and faculty involved in CME activities. These authorities\u2019 interpretation of these reporting requirements, which has been evolving and may continue to change, could affect pharmaceutical companies\u2019 views of their reporting obligations with respect to payments in support of physician speakers and faculty for CME activities. In implementing internal controls and procedures that promote adherence to applicable regulations and requirements, supporters of CME may interpret the regulations and requirements differently and may implement varying procedures or requirements. These regulations and requirements which are subject to change, and the related internal controls and procedures:\n\u2022\nmay discourage pharmaceutical and medical device companies from providing grants for independent educational activities;\n\u2022\nmay slow their internal approval for such grants;\n\u2022\nmay reduce the volume of third-party supported educational programming on Medscape Education to levels that are lower than in the past, thereby reducing revenue; and\n\u2022\nmay require Medscape, LLC and WebMD Global LLC to make changes to how they offer or provide educational programming.\nIf we are not able to comply with applicable regulations and requirements, then our ability to provide medical education programming will be limited, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to comply with applicable anti-corruption laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences\nThe United States and other countries have adopted anti-corruption laws that generally prohibit directly or indirectly giving, offering or promising inducements to public officials to elicit an improper commercial advantage. Under applicable U.S., U.K., German, and most European laws, this prohibition has been interpreted to apply to doctors and other medical professionals who work in state-run hospitals and state-run healthcare systems. Some of these laws broadly prohibit bribery in both the private and public sectors, even to self-employed HCPs. In recent years, several global anti-corruption enforcement actions led to significant monetary penalties against several companies operating in the global healthcare industry for providing illegal inducements to medical professionals.\nAs our business expands globally, we (and others acting on our behalf) increasingly interact with public officials, including with doctors and other medical professionals, at least some of whom work in state-run hospitals or healthcare systems. Such interactions inherently increase the risk of violating applicable anti-corruption laws. While we have implemented compliance policies and procedures to mitigate such risk, our personnel and others acting on our behalf could engage in conduct that violates such laws, for which we could be held responsible. Under such circumstances, we could be subject to civil and/or criminal penalties and other\nIndex to Financial Statements\nconsequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, brand, financial condition and results of operations.\nOther Risks Applicable to Our Company and to Ownership of Our Securities\nWe cannot assure you that our exploration of strategic alternatives will result in us pursuing a transaction or that any such transaction would be successfully completed, and there may be negative impacts on our business as a result of the process of exploring strategic alternatives\nOn February 16, 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors, working together with our management team and legal and financial advisors, had commenced a process to explore and evaluate potential strategic alternatives focused on maximizing shareholder value. These alternatives could include, among other things, the sale of part or all of the company, a merger with another party or other strategic transaction or continuing to execute on WebMD\u2019s business plan. Our Board has not set a timetable for this process. There can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in a transaction or that any transaction that is agreed to will be completed. Our ability to complete a transaction, if our Board decides to pursue one, will depend on numerous factors, some of which are outside of our control, including factors affecting the availability of financing for transactions and the financial markets in general. Even if a transaction is completed, there can be no assurance that it will be successful or have a positive effect on shareholder value.\nOur financial results and operations may be adversely affected by the diversion of management resources to the process of exploring strategic alternatives and by uncertainty regarding the outcome of the process. For example, the process could lead us to lose or fail to attract employees, customers or business partners. Although we have taken steps to address those risks, there can be no assurance that any such losses or distractions will not adversely affect our operations or financial results.\nProvisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover, which could adversely affect the value of our Common Stock\nOur Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws, as well as Delaware corporate law, contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control or changes in our management and board of directors that holders of our common stock might consider favorable and may prevent them from receiving a takeover premium for their shares. These provisions include, for example, our classified board structure and the authorization of our board of directors to issue up to 50 million shares of preferred stock without a stockholder vote. In addition, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that stockholders may not act by written consent and may not call special meetings. These provisions apply even if an offer to purchase our company may be considered beneficial by some of our stockholders. If a change of control or change in management is delayed or prevented, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nIf certain transactions occur with respect to our capital stock, limitations may be imposed on our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits to reduce our income taxes\nWebMD has substantial accumulated net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and tax credits available to offset taxable income in future tax periods. If certain transactions occur with respect to WebMD\u2019s capital stock (including issuances, redemptions, recapitalizations, exercises of options, conversions of convertible debt, purchases or sales by 5%-or-greater shareholders and similar transactions) that result in a cumulative change of more than 50% of the ownership of capital stock over a three-year period (as determined under rules prescribed by Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and applicable Treasury regulations), an annual limitation would be imposed with respect to the ability to utilize WebMD\u2019s NOL carryforwards and federal tax credits that existed at the time of the ownership change.\nIn November 2008, HLTH repurchased shares of its common stock in a tender offer. The tender offer resulted in a cumulative change of more than 50% of the ownership of HLTH\u2019s capital, as determined under rules prescribed by Section 382 of the Code and applicable Treasury regulations. As a result of this ownership change,\nIndex to Financial Statements\nthere is an annual limitation imposed on the amount of the NOL carryforwards and federal tax credits existing at the time of the ownership change that we may use to offset income in each tax year following the ownership change.\nIn September 2014 and December 2016, WebMD repurchased shares of its common stock in tender offers (collectively, the \u201cTender Offers\u201d). Completion of the Tender Offers may increase the possibility of another ownership change, which could decrease the existing annual limitation and would apply to all NOL carryforwards and tax credits generated prior to this potential new ownership change.\nWe may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property and proprietary rights\nOur intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our businesses. The steps that we take to protect our intellectual property, proprietary information and trade secrets may prove to be inadequate and, whether or not adequate, may be expensive. We rely on a combination of trade secret, patent and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures and non-disclosure contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. We cannot assure you that we will be able to detect potential or actual misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property, proprietary information or trade secrets. Even if we detect misappropriation or infringement by a third party, we cannot assure you that we will be able to enforce our rights at a reasonable cost, or at all. In addition, our rights to intellectual property, proprietary information and trade secrets may not prevent independent third-party development and commercialization of competing products or services.\nThird parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from providing certain services\nWe have been, and may continue to be, subject to claims that we are misappropriating or infringing intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others. These claims, even if not meritorious, may be expensive to defend and divert management\u2019s attention from our operations. If we become liable to third parties for infringing these rights, we could be required to pay a substantial damage award and to develop non-infringing technology, obtain a license or cease selling the products or services that use or contain the infringing intellectual property. We may be unable to develop non-infringing products or services or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We may also be required to indemnify our customers if they become subject to third-party claims relating to intellectual property that we license or otherwise provide to them, which could be costly.\nAcquisitions, business combinations and other transactions may be difficult to complete and, if completed, may have negative consequences for our business and our security holders\nWe may seek to acquire or to engage in business combinations with companies engaged in complementary businesses. In addition, we may enter into joint ventures, strategic alliances or similar arrangements with third parties. These transactions may result in changes in the nature and scope of our operations and changes in our financial condition. Our success in completing these types of transactions will depend on, among other things, our ability to locate suitable candidates and negotiate mutually acceptable terms with them, and to obtain adequate financing. Significant competition for these opportunities exists, which may increase the cost of and decrease the opportunities for these types of transactions. Financing for these transactions may come from several sources, including:\n\u2022\ncash and cash equivalents on hand and marketable securities;\n\u2022\nproceeds from the incurrence of indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nproceeds from the issuance of common stock, preferred stock, convertible debt or of other securities.\nThe issuance of additional equity or debt securities could:\n\u2022\ncause substantial dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders at the time of the issuance;\n\u2022\ncause substantial dilution of our earnings per share;\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u2022\nsubject us to the risks associated with increased leverage, including a reduction in our ability to obtain financing or an increase in the cost of any financing we obtain;\n\u2022\nsubject us to restrictive covenants that could limit our flexibility in conducting future business activities; and\n\u2022\nadversely affect the prevailing market price for our outstanding securities.\nWe do not intend to seek security holder approval for any such acquisition or security issuance unless required by applicable law, regulation or the terms of then-existing securities.\nOur business will suffer if we fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies or to assess the risks in particular transactions\nWe have in the past acquired, and may in the future acquire, businesses, technologies, services, product lines and other assets. The successful integration of the acquired businesses and assets into our operations, on a cost-effective basis, can be critical to our future performance. The amount and timing of the expected benefits of any acquisition, including potential synergies between our company and the acquired business, are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those relating to:\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain relationships with the customers of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain or replace key personnel of the acquired business;\n\u2022\npotential conflicts in sponsor or advertising relationships or in relationships with strategic partners;\n\u2022\nour ability to coordinate organizations that are geographically diverse and may have different business cultures; and\n\u2022\ncompliance with regulatory requirements.\nWe cannot guarantee that any acquired businesses will be successfully integrated with our operations in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all. Failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses or to achieve anticipated operating synergies, revenue enhancements or cost savings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough our management attempts to evaluate the risks inherent in each transaction and to value acquisition candidates appropriately, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain all such risks or that acquired businesses and assets will perform as we expect or enhance the value of our company as a whole. In addition, acquired companies or businesses may have larger than expected liabilities that are not covered by the indemnification, if any, that we are able to obtain from the sellers.\nWe may not be able to raise additional funds when needed for our business or to exploit opportunities\nOur future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including the success of our service offerings, market developments, and repurchases of our common stock. We may need to raise additional funds to support expansion, develop new or enhanced applications and services, respond to competitive pressures, acquire complementary businesses or technologies or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities. If required, we may raise such additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing, strategic relationships or other arrangements. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all, or that such financing will not be dilutive to our stockholders.\nIndex to Financial Statements", "PERMNO": 90914, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "WBMD"}
