{"cik": "1056285", "company": "KIRKLAND'S, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this report and other filings that we make from time to time with the SEC, including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes before investing in our common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. These risks are not the only risks we face. Our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity could also be adversely affected by additional factors that apply to all companies generally or by risks not currently known to us or that we currently view to be immaterial. We can provide no assurance and make no representation that our risk mitigation efforts, although we believe they are reasonable, will be successful.\nRisks Related to Strategy and Strategy Execution\nIf We Do Not Generate Sufficient Cash Flow, We May Not Be Able to Implement Our Growth Strategy.\nThe rate of our expansion will depend on, among other factors, the availability of adequate capital, which in turn will depend in large part on cash flow generated by our business and the availability of equity and debt capital. The cost of opening new stores, expanding, remodeling and relocating existing stores - which is part of our growth strategy - may increase in the future compared to historical costs. There can be no assurance that our business will generate adequate cash flow or that we will be able to obtain equity or debt capital on acceptable terms, or at all. Moreover, our senior credit facility contains provisions that restrict the amount of debt we may incur in the future. If we are not successful in obtaining sufficient capital, we may be unable to open additional stores or expand, remodel and relocate existing stores as planned, which may adversely affect our growth strategy resulting in a decrease in net sales. There can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve our plans for the opening of new stores and the expansion, remodeling or relocation of existing stores.\nIf We Are Unable to Profitably Open and Operate New Stores at a Rate that Exceeds Planned Store Closings, We May Not Be Able to Adequately Execute Our Growth Strategy, Resulting in a Decrease in Net Sales and Net Income.\nA key element of our growth strategy is to open new stores, both in existing markets and in new geographic markets that we select based on customer data and demographics. Our future operating results will depend to a substantial extent on whether we are able to continue to open and operate new stores successfully at a rate that exceeds our planned store closings.\nOur ability to open new stores and to expand, remodel and relocate existing stores depends on a number of factors, including the prevailing conditions in the commercial real estate market and our ability to:\n\u2022\nlocate and obtain favorable store sites and negotiate acceptable lease terms;\n\u2022\nconstruct or refurbish store sites;\n\u2022\nobtain and distribute adequate product supplies to our stores;\n\u2022\nmaintain adequate warehousing and distribution capability at acceptable costs;\n\u2022\nhire, train and retain skilled managers and personnel; and\n\u2022\ncontinue to upgrade our information and other operating systems to control the anticipated growth and expanded operations.\nThere also can be no assurance that we will be able to open, expand, remodel and relocate stores at the anticipated rate, if at all. Furthermore, there is no assurance that new stores that we open will generate net sales levels necessary to achieve store-level profitability. New stores that we open in our existing markets may draw customers away from our existing stores resulting in lower net sales growth compared to stores opened in new markets.\nEvery year we decide to close certain stores based on a number of factors, including but not limited to planned location of new stores nearby, excessive rent or other operating cost increases, inadequate profitability, short term leases, or the landlord\u2019s ability to replace us with another tenant at more favorable terms to the landlord. Store closings have the effect of reducing net sales. We may choose to close underperforming stores before lease expiration and incur termination costs associated with those closings. If we are not able to open new stores at a pace that exceeds the closing of existing stores we may not achieve our planned revenue growth.\nNew stores also may face greater competition and have lower anticipated net sales volumes relative to previously opened stores during their comparable years of operations. New stores opened in new markets, where we are less well known and where we are less familiar with the target customer, may face different or additional risks and increased marketing and other costs compared to stores operated in existing markets. These factors, together with increased pre-opening expenses at our new stores, may reduce our average store contribution and operating margins. If we are unable to profitably open and operate new stores and maintain the profitability of our existing stores, our net income could suffer.\nThe success of our growth plan will be dependent on our ability to promote and recruit a sufficient number of qualified Multi-Unit Managers, Store Managers and sales associates to support store growth. In addition, the time and effort required to train and supervise a large number of new managers and associates may divert resources from our existing stores and adversely affect our operating and financial performance.\nOur Success Depends Upon our Marketing, Advertising and Promotional Efforts. If We are Unable to Implement them Successfully, or if Our Competitors Market, Advertise or Promote More Effectively than We Do, Our Revenue May Be Adversely Affected.\nWe use marketing and promotional programs to attract customers to our stores and to encourage purchases by our customers. We use various media for our promotional efforts, including customer-targeted direct mail and email communications, as well as various digital and social media initiatives. If we fail to choose the appropriate medium for our efforts, or fail to implement and execute new marketing opportunities, our competitors may be able to attract some of our customers.\nIf our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions, if our advertising, media or marketing expenses increase, if our advertising and promotions become less effective than those of our competitors, or if we do not adequately leverage technology and data analytic capabilities needed to generate concise competitive insight, we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations. A failure to sufficiently innovate, develop customer relationship initiatives, or maintain adequate and effective advertising could inhibit our ability to maintain brand relevance and drive increased sales.\nWe May Not Be Able to Successfully Anticipate Consumer Trends, and Our Failure to Do So May Lead to Loss of Consumer Acceptance of Our Products Resulting in Reduced Net Sales.\nOur success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond to changing merchandise trends and consumer demands in a timely manner. While we devote considerable effort and resources to shape, analyze and respond to consumer preferences, consumer\nspending patterns and preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly. Our product introductions and product improvements, along with our other marketplace initiatives, are designed to capitalize on consumer trends. In order to remain successful, we must anticipate and react to these trends and develop new products or processes to address them. If we fail to identify and respond to emerging trends, consumer acceptance of the merchandise in our stores and our image with our customers may be harmed, which could reduce customer traffic in our stores and materially adversely affect our net sales.\nAdditionally, if we misjudge market trends, we may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced to take significant inventory markdowns, which would have a negative impact on our gross profit and cash flow. Conversely, shortages of items that prove popular could reduce our net sales. In addition, a major shift in consumer demand away from home d\u00e9cor could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe May Not Be Able to Successfully Respond to Technological Change, Our Website Could Become Obsolete and Our Financial Results and Conditions Could be Adversely Affected.\nWe maintain a corporate website through which we market and sell our products to customers and publicize Company information to customers, investors and other constituencies. Maintenance of our website requires substantial development and maintenance efforts, and entails significant technical and business risks. To remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality and features of our website. The sale of products through e-commerce is characterized by rapid technological change, the emergence of new industry standards and practices and changes in customer requirements and preferences. Therefore, we may be required to license emerging technologies, enhance our existing website, develop new services and technology that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our current and prospective customers, and adapt to technological advances and emerging industry and regulatory standards and practices in a cost-effective and timely manner. Our ability to remain technologically competitive may require substantial expenditures and lead time, and our failure to do so may harm our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Profitability\nInventory Loss and Theft and the Inability to Anticipate Inventory Needs may Result in Reduced Net Sales.\nWe are subject to the risk of inventory loss and theft. We have experienced inventory shrinkage in the past, and we cannot assure that incidences of inventory loss and theft will decrease in the future or that the measures we are taking will effectively reduce the problem of inventory shrinkage. Although some level of inventory shrinkage is an unavoidable cost of doing business, if we were to experience higher rates of inventory shrinkage or incur increased security costs to combat inventory theft, our financial condition could be affected adversely.\nEfficient inventory management is a key component of our business success and profitability. To be successful, we must maintain sufficient inventory levels to meet our customers\u2019 demands without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the costs to store and hold the goods unduly impacts our financial results. If our buying decisions do not accurately predict customer trends or purchasing actions, we may have to take unanticipated markdowns to dispose of the excess inventory, which also can adversely impact our financial results. Though we attempt to reduce these risks, we cannot assure you that we will continue to be successful in our inventory management, which may negatively impact our cash flows and results of operations.\nInability to Successfully Develop and Maintain a Relevant and Reliable Omni-channel Experience for Our Customers Could Adversely Affect Our Sales, Results of Operations and Reputation.\nOur business has evolved from an in-store experience to interactions with customers across multiple channels (in-store, online, mobile and social media, among others). Our customers are using computers, tablets, mobile phones and other devices to shop on our website and provide feedback and public commentary about all aspects of our business. Omni-channel retailing is rapidly evolving, and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments and technology investments by our competitors.\nSuccessful operation of our e-commerce initiatives are dependent on our ability to maintain uninterrupted availability of the Company\u2019s website and supporting applications, adequate inventory levels, timely fulfillment of customer orders, and accurate shipping of undamaged products. In addition, the Company\u2019s call center must maintain a high standard of customer care. Failure to successfully manage this process may negatively impact sales, result in the loss of customers, and damage our reputation.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain team members or contract with third parties having the specialized skills needed to support our omni-channel efforts, implement improvements to our customer-facing technology in a timely manner, or provide a convenient and consistent experience for our customers regardless of the ultimate sales channel, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, if www.kirklands.com and our other customer-facing technology systems do not appeal to our customers or reliably function as designed, we may experience a loss of customer confidence, lost sales or be exposed to fraudulent purchases, which, if significant, could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.\nOur Results Could be Negatively Impacted if our Merchandise Offering Suffers a Substantial Impediment to its Reputation Due to Real or Perceived Quality Issues.\nMaintaining, promoting and growing our merchandise offering will depend largely on the success of our design, merchandising, and marketing efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high quality customer experience. If we fail to achieve these objectives, our public image and reputation could be tarnished by negative publicity.\nIf our merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or customer expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk. All of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards. Events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns with respect to our products could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities. In addition, negative customer perceptions regarding the safety of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs, resulting in lost sales. In those circumstances, it may be difficult and costly for us to regain customer confidence.\nWe Face an Extremely Competitive Specialty Retail Business Market, and Such Competition Could Result in a Reduction of Our Prices and a Loss of Our Market Share.\nThe retail market is a highly competitive market. We compete against a diverse group of retailers, including specialty stores, department stores, discount stores, catalog and internet-based retailers, which sell similar lines of merchandise to those carried by us. Our competitors, many of which are larger and have substantially greater financial and other resources than us, include HomeGoods, Bed, Bath & Beyond, Cost Plus World Market, Hobby Lobby, Pier 1 Imports, At Home, Target, Ebay, Amazon and Wayfair. Our \u201cbrick-and-mortar\u201d stores and our www.kirklands.com website also compete with the ever-increasing number of internet retail websites offering home d\u00e9cor merchandise. The availability of home d\u00e9cor merchandise from various competitors on the internet could result in increased price competition as our customers are more readily able to comparison shop, which could reduce our sales, prices and margins and adversely affect our results of operations.\nCompetitors may have greater financial, distribution, logistics, marketing and other resources available to them and may be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly, devote greater resources to the design, sourcing, distribution, marketing and sale of their products, generate greater national brand recognition or adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Our competitors may also be able to increase sales in their new and existing markets faster than we do by emphasizing different distribution channels than we do. If we are unable to overcome these potential competitive disadvantages, such factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWeather Conditions Could Adversely Affect Our Sales and/or Profitability by Affecting Consumer Shopping Patterns.\nOur operating results may be adversely affected by severe or unexpected weather conditions. Adverse weather conditions or other extreme changes in the weather, including resulting electrical and technological failures, may disrupt our business and may adversely affect our ability to sell and distribute products. Frequent or unusual snow, ice or rain storms or extended periods of unseasonable temperatures in our markets could adversely affect our performance by affecting customer shopping patterns or diminishing demand for seasonal merchandise. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could reduce demand for a portion of our inventory and thereby reduce our sales and profitability.\nWe are Exposed to the Risk of Natural Disasters, Pandemic Outbreaks, Global Political Events, War and Terrorism That Could Disrupt Our Business and Result in Lower Sales, Increased Operating Costs and Capital Expenditures.\nOur headquarters, store locations, distribution center and warehouses, as well as certain of our vendors and customers, are located in areas which have been and could be subject to natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, fires or earthquakes. In addition, we operate in markets that may be susceptible to pandemic outbreaks, war, terrorist acts or disruptive global political events, such as civil unrest in countries in which our vendors are located or products are manufactured. Our business may be harmed if our ability to sell and distribute products is impacted by any such events, any of which could influence customer trends and purchases and may negatively impact our net sales, properties or operations. Such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties, the temporary closure of some or all of our stores or distribution center, the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market, temporary or long-term disruption in the transport of goods, delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution center or stores, disruption of our technology support or information systems, or fuel shortages or dramatic increases in fuel prices, which increase the cost of doing business. These events also can have indirect consequences such as increases in the costs of insurance if they result in significant loss of property or other insurable damage. Any of these factors, or combination thereof, could adversely affect our operations.\nOur Performance May be Affected by General Economic Conditions.\nOur performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending. Some of the factors that have had, and may in the future have, an impact on discretionary consumer spending include national or global economic downturns, an increase in consumer debt (and a corresponding decrease in the availability of affordable consumer credit), reductions in net worth based on recent severe market declines, softness in the residential real estate and mortgage markets, changes in taxation, increases in fuel and energy prices, fluctuation in interest rates, low consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors.\nSpecialty retail is a cyclical industry that is heavily dependent upon the overall level of consumer spending. Purchases of home d\u00e9cor tend to be highly correlated with cycles in consumers\u2019 disposable income and trends in the housing market. A weak retail environment could impact customer traffic in our stores and also adversely affect our net sales. Because of the seasonality of our business, economic downturns, increased sourcing costs, or scarcity in equipment during the last quarter of our fiscal year could adversely affect us to a greater extent than if such downturns occurred at other times of the year. As purchases of home d\u00e9cor items may decline during recessionary periods, a prolonged recession, including any related decrease in consumers\u2019 disposable incomes, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nShould credit markets tighten or turmoil in the financial markets develop, our ability to access funds, refinance our existing indebtedness, enter into agreements for new indebtedness or obtain funding through the issuance of our securities would be adversely impacted.\nThe impact of any such credit crisis or market turmoil on our major suppliers cannot be accurately predicted. The inability of key suppliers to access liquidity, or the insolvency of key suppliers, could lead to their failure to deliver our merchandise. Worsening economic conditions could also result in difficulties for financial institutions (including bank failures) and other parties with whom we do business, which could potentially impair our ability to access financing under existing arrangements or to otherwise recover amounts as they become due under our other contractual arrangements.\nOur Profitability is Vulnerable to Inflation and Cost Increases.\nFuture increases in costs such as the cost of merchandise, shipping rates, freight costs, fuel costs and store occupancy costs may reduce our profitability. These cost increases may be the result of inflationary pressures that could further reduce our sales or profitability. Increases in other operating costs, including changes in energy prices, wage rates and lease and utility costs, may increase our cost of goods sold or operating expenses. Competitive pressures in our industry may have the effect of inhibiting our ability to reflect these increased costs in the prices of our products and therefore reduce our profitability.\nOur Business Is Highly Seasonal and Our Fourth Quarter Contributes a Disproportionate Amount of Our Net Sales, Net Income and Cash Flow, and Any Factors Negatively Impacting Us During Our Fourth Quarter Could Reduce Our Net Sales, Net Income and Cash Flow, Leaving Us with Excess Inventory and Making It More Difficult for Us to Finance Our Capital Requirements.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, substantial seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating results, which are typical of many specialty retailers and common to most retailers generally. Due to the importance of the fall selling season, which includes Thanksgiving and Christmas, the last quarter of our fiscal year has historically contributed, and is expected to continue to contribute, a disproportionate amount of our net sales, net income and cash flow for the entire fiscal year. Any factors negatively affecting us during the last quarter of our fiscal year, including unfavorable economic or weather conditions, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, reducing our cash flow, leaving us with excess inventory and making it more difficult for us to finance our capital requirements.\nFailure to Control Merchandise Returns Could Negatively Impact the Business.\nWe have established a provision for estimated merchandise returns based upon historical experience and other known factors. If actual returns are greater than those projected by management, additional reductions of revenue could be recorded in the future. Also, to the extent that returned merchandise is damaged, we may not receive full retail value from the resale of the returned merchandise. Introductions of new merchandise, changes in merchandise mix, associate selling behavior, merchandise quality issues, changes to our return policy, e-commerce return behavior, changes in consumer confidence, or other competitive and general economic conditions may cause actual returns to exceed the provision for estimated merchandise returns. An increase in merchandise returns that exceeds our current provision could negatively impact the business and financial results.\nWe May Experience Significant Variations in Our Quarterly Results.\nOur quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly based upon such factors as the timing of new store openings, pre-opening expenses associated with new stores, the relative proportion of new stores to mature stores, net sales contributed by new stores, increases or decreases in comparable store net sales, adverse weather conditions, shifts in the timing of holidays, the timing and level of markdowns, changes in fuel and other shipping costs, changes in our product mix and actions\ntaken by our competitors. Consequently, comparisons between quarters are not necessarily meaningful and the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nOur Comparable Store Net Sales Fluctuate Due to a Variety of Factors.\nNumerous factors affect our comparable store net sales results, including among others, weather conditions, retail trends, the retail sales environment, economic conditions, the impact of competition and our ability to execute our business strategy efficiently. Our comparable store net sales results have historically experienced fluctuations, including declines in some fiscal periods. Our comparable store net sales may not increase from quarter to quarter, or may decline. As a result, the unpredictability of our comparable store net sales may cause our revenues and operating results to vary quarter to quarter, and an unanticipated decline in revenues or comparable store net sales may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly.\nOur Freight Costs and thus Our Cost of Goods Sold are Impacted by Changes in Fuel Prices.\nOur freight cost is impacted by changes in fuel prices through surcharges. Fuel prices and surcharges affect freight costs with respect to both inbound freight from vendors to our distribution center and outbound freight from our distribution center to our stores. Increased fuel prices or surcharges may increase freight costs and thereby increase our cost of goods sold.\nRisks Related to New Legislation, Regulation and Litigation\nNew Legal Requirements Could Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.\nOur business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations. We routinely incur costs in complying with these laws and regulations. We are exposed to the risk that federal, state or local legislation may negatively impact our operations. Changes in product regulations (including changes in labeling or disclosure requirements), federal or state wage requirements, employee rights (including changes in the process for our employees to join a union), health care, social welfare or entitlement programs such as health insurance, paid leave programs, or other changes in workplace regulation or tax laws could adversely impact our ability to achieve our financial targets. Changes in other regulatory areas, such as consumer credit, privacy and information security, or environmental regulation may result in significant added expenses or may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement and/or could materially increase our costs of doing business. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations may subject us to legal risk, including government enforcement action, significant fines and penalties and class action litigation, as well as reputational damage, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nConcern over climate change, including global warming, has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions. If domestic or international laws or regulations were expanded to require GHG emission reporting or reduction by us or our third-party manufacturers, or if we engage third-party contract manufacturers in countries that have existing GHG emission reporting or reduction laws or regulations, we would need to expend financial and other resources to comply with such regulations and/or to monitor our third-party manufacturers\u2019 compliance with such regulations. In addition, we cannot control the actions of our third-party manufacturers or the public\u2019s perceptions of them, nor can we assure that these manufacturers will conduct their businesses using climate change proactive or sustainable practices. Violations of climate change laws or regulations by third parties with whom we do business could result in negative public perception of us and/or delays in shipments and receipt of goods, and could subject us to fines or other penalties, any of which could restrict our business activities, increase our operating expenses or cause our sales to decline.\nThe costs and other effects of new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty. Additional laws may directly or indirectly affect our production, distribution, packaging, cost of raw materials, fuel, ingredients or water, any of which could impact our business and financial results. In addition, our efforts to comply with new legislation or regulations may increase our costs.\nLitigation May Adversely Affect Our Business, Financial Condition, Results of Operations or Liquidity.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, consumers, vendors, competitors, intellectual property rights holders, shareholders, government agencies and others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation means. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, regulatory actions and intellectual property claims, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, certain of these lawsuits, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may result in liability material to our consolidated financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operation are required. The cost to defend future litigation may be significant. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nProduct Liability Claims Could Adversely Affect Our Reputation.\nDespite our best efforts to ensure the quality and safety of the products we sell, we may be subject to product liability claims from customers or penalties from government agencies relating to allegations that the products sold by us are misbranded, contain contaminants or impermissible ingredients, provide inadequate instructions regarding their use or misuse, or include inadequate warnings concerning flammability or interactions with other substances. Such claims may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, storage, handling and transportation phases. All of our vendors and their products must comply with applicable product and safety laws. We generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our suppliers. However, if we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available, such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. Our ability to obtain indemnification from foreign suppliers may be hindered by the manufacturer\u2019s lack of understanding of United States product liability or other laws, which may make it more likely that we be required to respond to claims or complaints from customers as if we were the manufacturer of the products. Even with adequate insurance and indemnification, such claims could significantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in our products. Our litigation expenses could increase as well, which also could have a materially negative impact on our results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued.\nIf We Fail to Protect Our Brand Name, Competitors May Adopt Trade Names that Dilute the Value of Our Brand Name.\nWe may be unable or unwilling to strictly enforce our trademarks in each jurisdiction in which we do business. Also, we may not always be able to successfully enforce our trademarks against competitors or against challenges by others. Our failure to successfully protect our trademarks could diminish the value and efficacy of our brand recognition and could cause customer confusion, which could, in turn, adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nRisks Related to Dependence on Technology\nFailure to Protect the Integrity and Security of Individually Identifiable Data of Our Customers and Employees Could Expose Us to Litigation and Damage Our Reputation; The Expansion of Our e-Commerce Business Has Inherent Cybersecurity Risks That May Result in Business Disruptions.\nWe receive and maintain certain personal information about our customers and employees in the ordinary course of business. Our use of this information is regulated at the international, federal and state levels, as well as by certain third-parties with whom we contract for such services. If our security and information systems are compromised or our business associates fail to comply with these laws and regulations and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affect our reputation, as well as operations, results of operations, and financial condition and could result in litigation or the imposition of penalties. As privacy and information security laws and regulations change, we may incur additional costs to ensure we remain in compliance. Our business requires collection of large volumes of internal and customer data, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information of our customers in various information systems and those of our service providers. The integrity and protection of customer, employee, and company data is critical to us. If that data is inaccurate or incomplete, we or the store managers could make faulty decisions. Customers and employees also have a high expectation that we and our service providers will adequately protect their personal information. The regulatory environment surrounding information, security and privacy is also increasingly demanding. Our existing systems may be unable to satisfy changing regulatory requirements and employee and customer expectations, or may require significant additional investments or time to do so. Despite implementation of various measures designed to protect our information systems and records, including those we maintain with our service providers, we or the store managers may be subject to security breaches, system failures, viruses, operator error or inadvertent releases of data. A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of customer, employee, or company data maintained by us or by a service provider or failure to comply with the various United States and international laws and regulations applicable to the protection of such data or with Payment Card Industry data security standards, could adversely impact our reputation and could result in remedial and other expenses, fines, or litigation. A breach in the security of our information systems or those of our service providers could lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems, resulting in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits.\nCertain aspects of the business, particularly our website, heavily depend on consumers entrusting personal financial information to be transmitted securely over public networks. We have experienced increasing e-commerce sales over the past several years, which increases our exposure to cybersecurity risks. We invest considerable resources in protecting the personal information of our customers but are still subject to the risks of security breaches and cyber incidents resulting in unauthorized access to stored personal information. Any breach of our cybersecurity measures could result in violation of privacy laws, potential litigation, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, all of which could have a negative impact on our financial results and our reputation. In addition, a privacy breach could cause us to incur significant costs to restore the integrity of our system and could result in significant costs in government penalties and private litigation.\nOur Hardware and Software Systems Are Vulnerable to Damage that Could Harm Our Business.\nWe rely upon our existing information systems for operating and monitoring all major aspects of our business, including sales, warehousing, distribution, purchasing, inventory control, merchandise planning and replenishment, as well as various financial functions. These systems and our operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:\n\u2022\nfire, flood and other natural disasters;\n\u2022\npower loss, computer systems failures, internet and telecommunications or data network failure, operator negligence, improper operation by or supervision of employees, physical and electronic loss of data or security breaches, misappropriation and similar events; and\n\u2022\ncomputer viruses and malicious attacks and security breaches.\nAny disruption in the operation of our information systems, the loss of employees knowledgeable about such systems or our failure to continue to effectively modify such systems could interrupt our operations or interfere with our ability to monitor inventory, which could result in reduced net sales and affect our operations and financial performance. We also need to ensure that our systems are consistently adequate to handle our anticipated store growth and are upgraded as necessary to meet our needs. The cost of any such system upgrades or enhancements would be significant. If our systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe also rely heavily on our information technology staff. Failure to meet these staffing needs may negatively affect our ability to fulfill our technology initiatives while continuing to provide maintenance on existing systems. We rely on certain vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business. The software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers. The inability of these developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner. In addition, costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology, or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations.\nRisks Associated with Vendors and Distribution\nWe Depend on a Number of Vendors to Supply Our Merchandise, and Any Delay in Merchandise Deliveries from Certain Vendors May Lead to a Decline in Inventory Which Could Result in a Loss of Net Sales.\nAny disruption in the supply or increase in pricing of our merchandise could negatively impact our ability to achieve anticipated operating results. We purchase our products from approximately 200 vendors with which we have no long-term purchase commitments or exclusivity contracts. Historically, we have retained our vendors, and we have generally not experienced difficulty in obtaining desired merchandise from vendors on acceptable terms. However, our arrangements with these vendors do not guarantee the availability of merchandise, establish guaranteed prices or provide for the continuation of particular pricing practices. Our current vendors may not continue to sell products to us on current terms or at all, and we may not be able to establish relationships with new vendors to ensure delivery of products in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us. In addition, a period of unfavorable financial performance may make it difficult for some of our vendors to arrange for the financing or factoring of their orders with manufacturers, which could result in our inability to obtain desired merchandise from those vendors.\nOur largest vendor is deemed to be a related party because its principal owner is the spouse of the Company\u2019s Vice President of Product Development and Trends. During fiscal 2018, the Company\u2019s purchases from this related party vendor totaled approximately $54.3 million, or 20.7% of total merchandise purchases. Any disruption in the relationship could negatively impact our ability to achieve anticipated operating results.\nWe may not be able to acquire desired merchandise in sufficient quantities on terms acceptable to us in the future. Also, our business would be adversely affected if there were delays in product shipments to us due to freight difficulties, strikes or other difficulties at our principal transport providers or otherwise. We have from time to time experienced delays of this nature. We are also dependent on vendors for assuring the quality of merchandise supplied to us. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise in the future or the loss of one or more of our vendors and our failure to replace any one or more of them may harm our relationship with our customers resulting in a loss of net sales.\nWe Are Dependent on Foreign Imports for a Significant Portion of Our Merchandise, and Any Changes in the Trading Relations and Conditions Between the United States and the Relevant Foreign Countries May Lead to a Decline in Inventory Resulting in a Decline in Net Sales, or an Increase in the Cost of Sales Resulting in Reduced Gross Profit.\nMost of our merchandise is purchased through vendors in the United States who import the merchandise from foreign countries, primarily China. Our vendors are subject to the risks involved with relying on products manufactured abroad, and we\nremain subject to those risks to the extent that their effects are passed through to us by our vendors or cause disruptions in supply. These risks include changes in import duties, quotas, loss of \u201cmost favored nation\u201d trading status with the United States for a particular foreign country, work stoppages, delays in shipments, first cost price increases, freight cost increases, exchange rate fluctuations, terrorism, war, economic uncertainties (including inflation, foreign government regulations and political unrest), trade restrictions (including the United States imposing antidumping or countervailing duty orders, safeguards, remedies or compensation and retaliation due to illegal foreign trade practices) and other factors relating to foreign trade, including costs and uncertainties associated with efforts to identify and disclose sources of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d used in products that the Company causes to be manufactured and potential sell-through difficulties and reputational damage that may be associated with the inability of the Company to determine that such products are classified as \u201cDRC conflict-free.\u201d If any of these or other factors were to cause a disruption of trade from the countries in which the suppliers of our vendors are located, our inventory levels may be reduced or the cost of our products may increase.\nWe cannot predict the effect that future changes in economic or political conditions in foreign countries may have on our operations. Although we believe that we could access alternative sources in the event of disruptions or delays in supply due to economic, political or health conditions in foreign countries, such disruptions or delays may adversely affect our results of operations unless and until alternative supply arrangements can be made. In addition, merchandise purchased from alternative sources may be of lesser quality or more expensive than the merchandise we currently purchase abroad.\nCountries from which our vendors obtain these products may, from time to time, impose new or adjust prevailing quotas or other restrictions on exported products, and the United States may impose new duties, quotas and other restrictions on imported products. This could disrupt the supply of such products to us and adversely affect our operations. The United States Congress periodically considers other restrictions on the importation of products obtained for us by vendors. The cost of such products may increase for us if applicable duties are raised or import quotas with respect to such products are imposed or made more restrictive.\nWe are also subject to the risk that the manufacturers abroad who ultimately manufacture our products may employ labor practices that are not consistent with acceptable practices in the United States. In any such event, we could be hurt by negative publicity with respect to those practices and, in some cases, face liability for those practices.\nOur Success Is Highly Dependent on Our Planning and Control Processes and Our Supply Chain, and Any Disruption in or Failure to Continue to Improve These Processes May Result in a Loss of Net Sales and Net Income.\nAn important part of our efforts to achieve efficiencies, cost reductions and net sales growth is the continued identification and implementation of improvements to our planning, logistical and distribution infrastructure and our supply chain, including merchandise ordering, transportation and receipt processing. In addition, recent increases in energy prices have resulted, and are expected to continue to result, in increased merchandise and freight costs, which cannot readily be offset through higher prices because of competitive factors.\nA significant portion of the distribution of products to our stores and directly to our customers is coordinated through our west coast bypass operation and our two distribution facilities in Jackson, Tennessee. We depend on the orderly operation of these receiving and distribution facilities, which rely on adherence to shipping schedules and effective management. We are also currently exploring alternative distribution methods and from time to time we make significant upgrades to our warehouse management software. If these changes or upgrades do not go smoothly, then we could face significant disruptions with our distribution process. In addition, we cannot assure that events beyond our control, such as disruptions due to fire or other catastrophic events, labor disagreements or shipping problems, will not result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores. We also cannot guarantee that our insurance will be sufficient, or that insurance proceeds will be timely paid to us, in the event our distribution center is shut down for any reason. Any significant disruption in the operations of our distribution facilities would have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain proper inventory levels in our stores and satisfy our e-commerce customers, which could result in a loss of net sales and net income.\nRisks Related to Company Governance and Ownership\nWe Depend on Key Personnel, and, if We Lose the Services of Any Member of Our Senior Management Team, We May Not Be Able to Run Our Business Effectively.\nWe have benefited substantially from the leadership and performance of our senior management team. Our success will depend on our ability to retain our current senior management members and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. Competition for senior management personnel is intense, and there can be no assurances that we will be able to retain our personnel. The loss of a member of senior management would require the remaining executive officers to divert immediate and substantial attention to seeking a replacement.\nOur Charter and Bylaw Provisions and Certain Provisions of Tennessee Law May Make It Difficult in Some Respects to Cause a Change in Control of Kirkland\u2019s and Replace Incumbent Management.\nOur charter authorizes the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our Board of Directors. Accordingly, the Board of Directors is empowered, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could materially adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock. Holders of the common stock do not have preemptive rights to subscribe for a pro rata portion of any capital stock which may be issued by us. In the event of issuance, such preferred stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of Kirkland\u2019s.\nOur charter and bylaws contain certain corporate governance provisions that may make it more difficult to challenge management, deter and inhibit unsolicited changes in control of Kirkland\u2019s and have the effect of depriving our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium over the prevailing market price of our common stock in the event of an attempted hostile takeover. First, the charter provides for a classified Board of Directors, with directors (after the expiration of the terms of the initial classified board of directors) serving three year terms from the year of their respective elections and being subject to removal only for cause and upon the vote of 80% of the voting power of all outstanding capital stock entitled to vote (the \u201cVoting Power\u201d). Second, our charter and bylaws do not generally permit shareholders to call, or require that the Board of Directors call, a special meeting of shareholders. The charter and bylaws also limit the business permitted to be conducted at any such special meeting. In addition, Tennessee law permits action to be taken by the shareholders by written consent only if the action is consented to by holders of the number of shares required to authorize shareholder action and if all shareholders entitled to vote are parties to the written consent. Third, the bylaws establish an advance notice procedure for shareholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring other business before meetings of the shareholders. Only those shareholder nominees who are nominated in accordance with this procedure are eligible for election as directors of Kirkland\u2019s, and only such shareholder proposals may be considered at a meeting of shareholders as have been presented to Kirkland\u2019s in accordance with the procedure. Finally, the charter provides that the amendment or repeal of any of the foregoing provisions of the charter mentioned previously in this paragraph requires the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the Voting Power. In addition, the bylaws provide that the amendment or repeal by shareholders of any bylaws made by our Board of Directors requires the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the Voting Power.\nFurthermore, Kirkland\u2019s is subject to certain provisions of Tennessee law, including certain Tennessee corporate takeover acts that are, or may be, applicable to us. These acts, which include the Investor Protection Act, the Business Combination Act and the Tennessee Greenmail Act, seek to limit the parameters in which certain business combinations and share exchanges occur. The charter, bylaws and Tennessee law provisions may have an anti-takeover effect, including possibly discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for our common stock.\nIf We Fail to Maintain an Effective System of Internal Control, We May Not be Able to Accurately Report Our Financial Results.\nAs a public company, we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 so that our management can certify the effectiveness of our internal controls and our independent registered public accounting firm can render an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we may incur substantial expenses to test our systems, to make any necessary improvements, and to hire additional personnel.\nWe maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting, but there are limitations inherent in internal control systems. If we are unable to maintain adequate and effective internal control over financial reporting, our financial reporting could be adversely affected. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be appropriate relative to their costs.\nIf our management is unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence, which could harm our business and cause a decline in our common stock price. In addition, if we do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis, which could cause a decline in our common stock price and harm our ability to raise capital. Failure to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis could also jeopardize our continued listing on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC or any other stock exchange on which our common stock may be listed. Delisting of our common stock on any exchange could reduce the liquidity of the market for our common stock, which could reduce the price of our common stock and increase the volatility of our common stock price.\nThe Market Price for Our Common Stock Might Be Volatile and Could Result in a Decline in the Value of Your Investment.\nThe price at which our common stock trades may be volatile. The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to our operating results, general trends and prospects for the retail industry, announcements by our competitors, analyst recommendations, our ability to meet or exceed analysts\u2019 or investors\u2019 expectations, the condition of the financial markets and other factors. In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock notwithstanding our actual operating performance.", "PERMNO": 89449, "SIC": 5990, "TIC": "KIRK"}
