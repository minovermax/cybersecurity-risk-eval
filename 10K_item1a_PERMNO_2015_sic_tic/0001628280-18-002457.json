{"cik": "789460", "company": "WORLD FUEL SERVICES CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe extend credit to most of our customers in connection with their purchase of fuel and services from us, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be adversely affected if we are unable to collect accounts receivable.\nOur success in attracting customers has been due, in part, to our willingness to extend credit on an unsecured basis to customers as opposed to requiring prepayment, letters of credit or other forms of credit support. Even in cases where we do obtain credit enhancements, such as guarantees, offset rights, collateral or other forms of security, such rights may not be sufficient or fully collectible depending on the circumstances of the customer at the time of default. While no single customer represents more than 10% of our total consolidated revenue, diversification of credit risk is limited to the aviation, marine and land transportation industries within which we primarily do business.\nOur exposure to credit losses will depend on the financial condition of our customers and other macroeconomic factors beyond our control, such as deteriorating conditions in the world economy or in the industries we serve, changes in oil prices and political instability. While we actively manage our credit exposure and work to respond to both changes in our customers\u2019 financial conditions or macroeconomic events, there can be no guarantee we will be able to successfully mitigate all of these risks. Substantial credit losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to adequately finance our capital requirements and fund our investments, which, if not available to us, would impact our ability to conduct our operations.\nWe rely on credit arrangements with banks, suppliers and other parties as an important source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by our operating cash flow. Future market volatility, generally, and persistent weakness in global energy markets may adversely affect our ability to access capital and credit markets or to obtain funds at low interest rates or on other advantageous terms. If we are unable to obtain credit as and when we need it on commercially reasonable terms or at all, such as in the event there is a substantial tightening of the global credit markets or a substantial increase in interest rates, it could have a negative impact on our liquidity, business, financial condition, and cash flows, as well as our future development and growth. Furthermore, our business is impacted by the availability of trade credit to fund fuel purchases and an actual or perceived decline in our liquidity or operations could cause our suppliers to seek credit support in the form of additional collateral, limit the extension of trade credit, or otherwise materially modify their payment terms. Adverse changes in our payment terms from principal suppliers, including shortened payment cycles, decreased credit lines or requiring prepayment could impact our liquidity, business, results of operations and cash flows.\nFinally, if we are unable to obtain debt or other forms of financing and instead raise capital through an equity issuance, existing shareholders would be diluted. Even if we are able to obtain financing, the restrictions our creditors may place on our operations or our increased interest expense and leverage could limit our ability to grow.\nSales to government customers involve unique risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition to normal business risks, our supply of products and services to U.S. and foreign government, intergovernmental and military customers (\u201cgovernment customers\u201d) subjects us to unique risks, many of which are beyond our control. These risks include:\n\u2022\nDependence on government spending on defense programs, which can be negatively affected by budgetary constraints, changes in defense spending policies, government shutdowns and changes in military policies or priorities;\n\u2022\nContract awards that are typically made through a competitive bidding process, which can involve substantial costs and managerial time to prepare and submit bids for contracts that may not be awarded to us;\n\u2022\nExpense and delays that may arise if our competitors protest or challenge contract awards made to us;\n\u2022\nContracts for indefinite delivery, such that there are no guarantees on the quantity the government will buy or when it will buy from us; and\n\u2022\nThe ability for government customers to unilaterally modify certain terms and conditions in existing contracts or terminate existing contracts for their convenience.\nFurthermore, government customer contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other complex requirements, which affect how we transact business with our government customers and can impose additional costs on our business operations. Numerous laws and regulations affect our U.S. government contracts, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which governs the formation, administration and performance of government contracts, and the federal False Claims Act, which provides for substantial criminal and civil penalties and treble damages where a contractor presents a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. government for payment. Similar laws and regulations also may apply to our contracts with foreign government and intergovernmental agency customers.\nGovernment customers routinely audit government contractors to review contract performance, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and compliance with internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated may not be reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, may need to be refunded and could subject us to a variety of government claims. Also, any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in payments being withheld, penalties and reduced future business. Improper or illegal activities, including those caused by our subcontractors, could subject us to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions, including contract termination, fines, forfeiture of fees, suspension of payment and suspension or debarment from doing business with government agencies, any of which could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA material portion of our profitability is derived from our government business, and the loss or material reduction in business from our government customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nSales to government customers, which includes sales to the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), have accounted for a material portion of our profitability in recent years, and we expect this to continue in the foreseeable future. The profitability associated with our government business can be materially impacted by supply disruptions, border closures, road blockages, hostility-related product losses, inventory shortages and other logistical difficulties that can arise when sourcing and delivering fuel in areas that are actively engaged in war or other military conflicts. Our sales to government customers may fluctuate significantly from time to time as a result of the foregoing factors, as well as the level of troop deployments and related activity in a particular region or area or the commencement, extension, renewal or completion of existing and new government contracts. Furthermore, changes in military policies or priorities, such as the decision to withdraw or reduce armed force levels in different geographies, can be sudden, subjecting us to losses or higher expenses associated with disposing of unused inventory, removal or abandonment of equipment and relocation of employees.\nAs a result of complex supply logistics, the indefinite nature of government contracts, and other associated risks, sales of products and services to government customers often carry higher margins than sales to our other customers. Consequently, a decrease in sales or increase in supply costs to our government customers would contribute disproportionately to a reduction in our gross margin and overall profitability and such decrease could be sudden. The loss of a key government customer or a material reduction in sales to government customers would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur derivative transactions with customers, suppliers, merchants and financial institutions expose us to price and credit risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs part of our price risk management services, we offer to customers various pricing structures for the purchase of fuel, including derivatives products designed to hedge exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into fixed forward contracts with some of our counterparties under which we agree to sell or purchase certain volumes of fuel at fixed prices. In addition, we may act as a counterparty in over-the-counter swap transactions with some of our customers where the customer may be required to pay us in connection with changes in the price of fuel. Further, we may use derivatives to hedge price risks associated with our fuel inventories and purchase and sale commitments. We typically hedge our price risk in any of the foregoing types of transactions by entering into derivative instruments with large energy companies, trading houses and financial institutions.\nIf we have not required a customer to post collateral in connection with a fixed forward contract or swap transaction and there is an outstanding mark-to-market liability owing, we will have effectively extended unsecured credit to that customer and such amounts could be substantial. Based on the volatility of fuel prices, our counterparties may not be willing or able to fulfill their obligations to us under their fixed forward contracts or swap transactions. In such cases, we would be exposed to potential losses or costs associated with any resulting default. For example, in the event the spot market price of fuel at the time of delivery is substantially less than the fixed price of the contract with the customer, a customer could default on its purchase obligation to us and purchase the fuel at a lower \u201cspot\u201d market price from another supplier. Meanwhile, we may have entered into a corresponding commitment with a supplier to offer our customer specified fixed pricing or terms and would be obligated to perform our fixed price purchase obligations to such supplier. Similarly, the counterparties with whom we may hedge our price risk exposure may not be willing or able to fulfill their obligations to us under their swap transactions.\nWhile we monitor and manage our credit exposures to our counterparties, credit defaults may still occur and the actual recovery will depend on the financial condition of that counterparty and our ability to enforce any obligation owed to us. Accordingly, if we are unable to recover such losses from a defaulting counterparty, we could sustain substantial losses that would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to various risks in connection with our use of derivatives which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe enter into financial derivative contracts primarily to mitigate the risk of market price fluctuations in fuel products, to offer our customers fuel pricing alternatives to meet their needs, to manage price exposures associated with our inventories, and to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. However, our efforts to hedge our exposure to fuel price and exchange rate fluctuations may be ineffective in certain instances. For example, we hedge jet fuel prices with derivatives tied to other petroleum products that have historically been correlated to aviation jet fuel (e.g. heating oil in the United States or gasoil in Europe or Asia). If the price of aviation jet fuel at a specific location experiences a divergence to historical correlations, our attempts to mitigate price risk associated with our aviation business may not be effective. Moreover, there may be times where the change in the price of jet fuel at a specific location is disrupted (e.g. hurricanes) and is not correlated to the underlying hedges when compared to historical prices.\nWe also enter into proprietary derivative transactions, which are not intended to hedge our own risk but rather make a profit by capitalizing on arbitrage opportunities associated with basis, time, quality or geographic spreads related to fuel products we sell. Proprietary derivative transactions, by their nature, expose us to changes in commodity prices in relation to the proprietary positions taken. Although we have established limits on such exposure, any adverse changes could result in losses which can be further exacerbated by volatility in the financial and other markets. In addition, our employees failing to comply with our policies and procedures with respect to hedging or proprietary trading, such as engaging in unauthorized trading activity, failing to hedge a specific price risk or failing to comply with our internal limits on exposure, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFinally, many of our derivative transactions are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes, and we therefore may recognize changes in the fair market value of these derivatives as a component of revenue or cost of revenue (based on the underlying transaction type) in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. Since the fair market value of these derivatives is marked to market at the end of each quarter, changes in the value of our derivative instruments as a result of gains or losses may cause our earnings to fluctuate from period to period.\nIf we fail to comply with laws or other government regulations applicable to our operations, we could suffer penalties or costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are required to comply with extensive and complex laws and other regulations in the countries in which we operate at the international, federal, state/provincial and local government levels relating to, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe transportation, handling and delivery of fuel and fuel products;\n\u2022\nthe operation of fuel storage, blending and distribution facilities;\n\u2022\nworkplace safety;\n\u2022\nfuel spillage or seepage;\n\u2022\nenvironmental protection, carbon emissions and hazardous waste disposal;\n\u2022\nconsumer protection;\n\u2022\ndata privacy and protection;\n\u2022\ncommodities trading, brokerage, derivatives and advisory services;\n\u2022\ncredit and payment card processing and payment services;\n\u2022\ngovernment contracting and procurement;\n\u2022\nantitrust and competition;\n\u2022\nanti-money laundering, financial services, and funds transmission; and\n\u2022\nregulatory reporting and licensing.\nDue to the complex and technical nature of these laws and regulations, inadvertent violations may occur. If we fail to comply with these laws or regulations for any reason, we would be required to correct or implement measures to prevent a recurrence of any violations, which could increase our operating costs. If more serious violations were to occur, we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties or to civil or criminal liability. Any substantial fines and costs incurred as a result of a violation of such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with U.S. or foreign tax laws or a government challenging our tax position could adversely affect our business and future operating results.\nWe are affected by various U.S. and foreign taxes, including income taxes and taxes imposed on the purchase and sale of aviation, marine and land fuel products, such as sales, excise, value added tax (\u201cVAT\u201d), energy, environmental and other taxes. From time to time, we may also benefit from special tax concessions in certain jurisdictions. For example, we have operated under a special income tax concession in Singapore since 2008 which is conditional upon our meeting certain employment and investment thresholds which, if not met in accordance with our agreement, may eliminate the benefit beginning with the first year in which the conditions are not satisfied. The income tax concession reduces the income tax rate on qualified sales and derivative gains and losses. The impact of this income tax concession decreased (increased) foreign income taxes by $1.3 million, $2.7 million and $(7.7) million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The impact of the income tax concession on a diluted earnings per common share basis was $0.02 for 2017, $0.04 for 2016 and $(0.11) for 2015. Changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws, our failure to comply with such laws or the loss of tax concessions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFurthermore, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our tax expense includes estimates of additional tax that may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings that could affect the valuation of our net deferred tax assets. Our operating results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax legislation, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our income tax exposures.\nFrom time to time, we are under review by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and indirect tax matters and are involved in various challenges and litigation in a number of countries, including, in particular, the U.S., Brazil, Denmark and South Korea, where the amounts under controversy may be material. We are in the process of challenging a number of these tax assessments in several administrative and legal proceedings, which are at various stages of appeal. In addition, in some jurisdictions these challenges require the posting of collateral or payment of the contested amount which may affect our flexibility in operating our business or our liquidity. If these challenges are ultimately determined adversely to us, these proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects. Furthermore, any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or appropriately resolve these challenges could subject us to administrative, civil, and criminal remedies, including fines, penalties, disgorgement, injunctions and damage to our reputation. See notes 9 and 11 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding certain tax matters.\nFinally, we earn a material amount of our operating income from outside the U.S., and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the U.S. may result in higher effective income tax rates for us. Further, recent developments, including investigations by the European Commission on illegal state aid, the project by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (\u201cBEPS\u201d) and other initiatives, could adversely affect our worldwide effective tax rate. With the finalization of specific actions contained within the OECD\u2019s BEPS study, many OECD countries have acknowledged their intent to implement the actions and update their local tax laws. The extent (if any) to which countries in which we operate adopt and implement these actions could have a material adverse impact on our effective tax rate, income tax expense, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows.\nRecent U.S. tax legislation, as well as future substantial changes that may be made by the Trump Administration to regulatory, fiscal and trade policies, may materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. President signed into law tax legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d). This legislation significantly changes the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, including taxation of U.S. corporations, by, among other things, limiting interest deductions, reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate, altering the expensing of capital expenditures, adopting elements of a territorial tax system, taxing global intangible low-taxed income (\u201cGILTI\u201d), assessing a repatriation tax or \u201ctoll-charge\u201d on undistributed earnings and profits of U.S.-owned foreign corporations, and introducing certain base erosion and anti-abuse minimum tax provisions. The legislation is unclear in certain respects and will require interpretations and implementing regulations by the IRS, as well as state tax authorities, and the legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, any of which could increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation.\nBecause of the complexity of the GILTI tax rules effective in 2018, we continue to evaluate this provision of the Tax Act and the application of Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standard Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 740, Income Taxes (\u201cASC Topic 740\u201d). Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), we are allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either (1) treating taxes due on future U.S. GILTI inclusions as a current period expense when incurred (the \u201cperiod cost method\u201d) or (2) factoring such amounts into our measurement of our deferred taxes (the \u201cdeferred method\u201d). Our selection of an accounting policy with respect to the new GILTI tax rules will depend, in part, on analyzing our global income and our global structure to determine whether we expect to have future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI and the impacts thereof. We are currently analyzing this provision and have not made any adjustment related to potential GILTI tax in our financial statements and have not made a policy decision regarding whether to record deferred tax on GILTI since a reasonable amount cannot be determined.\nThe changes included in the Tax Act are broad and complex. The final transition impacts of the Tax Act may differ from our estimates, possibly materially, due to, among other items, changes in interpretations of the Tax Act, any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the Tax Act, any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the Tax Act, or any updates or changes to current year earnings and tax estimates. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 regarding application of ASC Topic 740, we anticipate that we will finalize our provisional estimates and determine the impact of any potential deferred tax related to GILTI during the measurement period and reflect any necessary adjustments in the subsequent periods. Any material revisions in our computations could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, there may be other material adverse effects resulting from the legislation that we have not yet identified. If we are unable to successfully take actions to manage the adverse impacts of the new tax legislation, or if additional interpretations, regulations, amendments or technical corrections exacerbate the adverse impacts of the legislation, the legislation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur physical operations have inherent risks that could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe provide various products and services to customers, including but not limited to into-plane fueling at airports, fueling of vessels in port and at sea, on the ground fueling of customer storage tanks and vehicles, and transportation, delivery and storage of fuel and fuel products. Operating fuel storage and distribution terminals and transporting fuel products involve inherent risks, such as:\n\u2022\nfires, collisions and other catastrophic disasters;\n\u2022\ntraffic accidents, injuries and loss of life;\n\u2022\nspills, discharges, contaminations and other releases;\n\u2022\nsevere damage to and destruction of property and equipment; and\n\u2022\nloss of product and business interruption.\nAny of the foregoing could result in distribution difficulties and disruptions, environmental pollution, government-imposed fines or clean-up obligations, personal injury or wrongful death claims, and other damage to our properties and the properties of others. Although we generally maintain liability insurance for these types of events, such insurance may be insufficient to cover certain losses which may be in excess of coverage limits or outside the scope of the coverage. If we are held liable for any damages, and the liability is not adequately covered by insurance, our financial position and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nIn addition, some of our employees are represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements, including certain of our truck drivers that transport and deliver fuel and fuel-related products. Employees who are not currently represented by labor unions may seek union representation in the future, and any renegotiation of current collective bargaining agreements may result in terms that are less favorable to us. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are good, if our unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown in the future, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, which could interfere with our ability to transport and deliver products on a timely basis and could have other negative effects, such as decreased productivity and increased labor costs. A significant labor dispute with our own union employees, or by the union employees of third parties who provide services for our business, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to environmental risks and extensive laws and regulations pertaining to environmental protection, health, safety and security that can result in material costs and liabilities.\nOur business is subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to fuel storage and distribution, terminals, underground storage tanks, the release or discharge of regulated materials into the air, water and soil, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, the exposure of persons to regulated materials, and the health and safety of our employees. A violation of, liability under, or noncompliance with these laws and regulations, or any future environmental law or regulation, could result in significant liability, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remediation costs for natural resource damages as well as third-party damages. Furthermore, some environmental laws impose strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances, which could subject us to liability without regard to whether we were negligent or at fault. In our marine segment we utilize fuel delivery barges and store refined products adjacent to water, thereby potentially subjecting us to strict, joint, and potentially unlimited liability for removal costs and other consequences of an oil spill where the spill is into navigable waters, along shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the United States. Any of these occurrences, and any resulting negative media coverage, could have a material adverse effect on our stock price and on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFurther, increasingly stringent U.S. federal and foreign environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to increase our overall cost of business. For example, compliance with existing and future laws regulating the delivery of fuel by barge, truck, vessel, pipeline or railcar; that regulate fuel storage terminals or underground storage tanks that we own, lease or operate; or that regulate the quality of product under our control may require significant capital expenditures and increased operating and maintenance costs, particularly as we acquire businesses with more physical assets. In addition, mandatory fuel standards have been adopted in many jurisdictions, such as amendments to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, or MARPOL, which established a phased reduction of the sulfur content in fuel oil and allows for stricter sulfur limits in designated emission control areas, will be effective in January 2020. Further changes in laws and regulations applicable to international and national maritime trade are expected over the coming years. These and future changes to applicable standards or other more stringent requirements in the industries we serve could reduce our ability to procure product, require us to incur additional handling costs and/or require the expenditure of capital. To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products, our business and result of operations would be adversely affected.\nDue to our international operations, we are subject to U.S. and international laws, including U.S. economic sanctions, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar anti-bribery laws, which can impose substantial compliance costs and subject us to civil or criminal penalties for non-compliance.\nDoing business on a global basis requires us to comply with the laws and regulations in jurisdictions worldwide that can impose substantial compliance costs and subject us to civil or criminal penalties for non-compliance. In particular, our global operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, such as the FCPA, anti-money laundering laws, international trade controls, and antitrust and competition laws. The FCPA prohibits us from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of improperly influencing official decisions or improperly obtaining or retaining business. Where applicable, the U.K. Bribery Act prohibits bribery both in the U.K. and internationally, including bribery across both public and private sectors. As part of our business, we regularly deal with state-owned enterprises, the employees of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other applicable anti-bribery laws. In addition, some of the international jurisdictions in which we operate lack a developed legal system and have higher than normal levels of corruption. Our activities in these countries may increase the risk of improper payment demands made to, or offers made by, one of our employees or other parties acting on our behalf, and the rejection of demands to make such improper payments may also negatively impact our activities in those countries.\nFurthermore, international trade controls, including economic sanctions such as those administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d), export controls and anti-boycott regulations are complex, restrict our business dealings with certain countries and individuals, and are constantly changing. Additional restrictions may be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a manner that materially impacts our operations. From time to time, certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive OFAC administered sanctions. These business dealings currently represent an immaterial amount of our consolidated revenue and income and are undertaken pursuant to general and/or specific licenses issued by OFAC or as otherwise permitted by applicable sanctions regulations. As a result of the above activities, we are exposed to a heightened risk of violating trade control regulations.\nWe have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with these laws and regulations, but such policies and procedures may not always prevent us from violations. Violations of these laws are punishable\nby fines and expose us and/or employees to criminal sanctions and civil suits and subject us to other adverse consequences including the denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts, revocations or restrictions of licenses. In addition, non-compliance with laws could adversely affect, among other things, our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Violations of law could also cause an event of default under our Credit Facility, which if not waived, could result in the acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness, could trigger cross defaults under other agreements to which we are a party (such as certain derivative contracts), and would impair our ability to obtain working capital advances and letters of credit. Such events could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThird parties who fail to provide products or services to us or our customers as agreed could harm our business.\nWe purchase fuel and other products from suppliers and resell to customers. If the fuel and other products we sell fail to meet the specifications we have agreed to with customers, we could incur material liabilities if such products cause physical damage to a vessel or aircraft or result in other losses such that a customer initiates a claim or a lawsuit for which we settle or results in a decision against us. In addition, our relationship with our customers could be adversely affected and adverse publicity about any allegations of contaminated products may negatively affect us, regardless of whether the allegations are true. Although in most cases our agreements with suppliers provide that we have recourse against our suppliers for products that fail to meet contractual specifications, if the terms of such agreements are not adequate to protect our interests, we may not be able to enforce such recourse. In the event we are able to pursue it, such recourse cannot be assured and may be costly to enforce. For example, several of our supply agreements are with foreign entities, including foreign governments, and are governed by the laws of foreign jurisdictions. If a supplier breaches such agreement, then we may incur the additional costs of determining our rights and obligations under the agreement, under applicable foreign laws, and enforcing an agreement in a foreign jurisdiction. Any material liability in excess of any applicable insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe also use third parties to provide various services to our customers, including into plane fueling at airports, fueling of vessels in port and at sea and delivering land-based fuel. The failure of these third parties to perform these services in accordance with contractual terms for any reason, such as their inability to supply specified fuel or an interruption of their business because of weather, environmental or labor difficulties or political unrest, could affect our relationships with our customers and subject us to claims and other liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nInformation technology (\u201cIT\u201d) failures and data security breaches, including as a result of cybersecurity attacks, could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition, subject us to increased operating costs, and expose us to litigation.\nWe rely heavily on our computer systems, information technology and network infrastructure across our operations, particularly as we seek to grow our technology offerings, digitize our business and drive internal efficiencies. Despite our implementation of security and back-up measures, our technology systems are vulnerable to damage, disability or failures due to physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, operational error, or other catastrophic events. Our technology systems are also subject to cybersecurity attacks including malware, other malicious software, phishing email attacks, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data, the unauthorized release, corruption or loss of our data, loss or damage to our data delivery systems, and other electronic security breaches. Due to the large number of transactions that run through our systems each day, significant system down-time or slow-down could have a material impact on our ability to conduct business, process and record transactions, as well as make operational and financial decisions. In addition, as we continue to grow the volume of transactions in our businesses, our existing IT systems infrastructure, applications and related functionality may be unable to effectively support a larger scale operation, which can cause the information being processed to be unreliable and impact our decision-making or damage our reputation with customers. We have also been increasing our use of cloud-based technology and computing platforms operated by third parties. If our use of these cloud services is disrupted either due to system failures, denial of service or other cyberattacks and computer viruses, or if the infrastructure which allows us to connect to the third party systems is interrupted, it could adversely impact our operations and our business.\nIn addition to our own vulnerabilities, our reliance on email transmissions over public networks to process certain transactions exposes us to risks associated with the failure of our customers, business partners and other third parties to use appropriate controls to protect sensitive information, as well as to risks of on-line fraud and email scams. Furthermore, despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and prevent future cybersecurity attacks, it is possible that our business, financial and other systems could be compromised, especially because such attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources including persons involved in organized crime or associated with external\nservice providers. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or use electronic means to induce us to enter into fraudulent transactions. Past and future occurrences of such attacks could damage our reputation and our ability to conduct our business, impact our credit and risk exposure decisions, cause us to lose customers or revenues, subject us to litigation and require us to incur substantial expenses to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these issues, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe currently maintain insurance to protect against cybersecurity risks and incidents. However, insurance coverage may not be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at commercially reasonable rates. In addition, insurance coverage may be insufficient or may not cover certain of these cybersecurity risks and, even if available, the insurance proceeds received for any loss or damage may be insufficient to cover our losses or liabilities without materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe personal information that we collect may be vulnerable to breach, theft, loss or misuse that could increase operational costs, result in regulatory penalties and adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.\nIn connection with various businesses we operate, such as our transaction management and payment processing businesses, we have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information from our employees, customers (both corporate and individual consumers), suppliers and other third parties, some of which may be subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer imposed controls. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, process, transmit and retain sensitive information regarding these parties. Despite our efforts to protect this information, our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data and programming and human errors that could potentially lead to such information being compromised.\nFailure to adequately protect this information could lead to substantial fines, penalties, third party liability, remediation costs, potential cancellation of existing contracts and inability to compete for future business. Due to legislative and regulatory rules, we may be required to notify the owners of such information of any data breaches, which could harm our business relationships, reputation and financial results, as well as subject us to litigation or actions by regulatory authorities. Furthermore, there has been heightened legislative and regulatory focus on data security in the U.S. and abroad (particularly in the European Union through the General Data Protection Regulation that will go into effect in May 2018). Substantial changes in applicable regulations may require us to make costly changes to our systems. Although we have taken steps to address these concerns by implementing network security and internal control measures, these steps may not prevent a data security breach and any data security breach may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nImplementation of our growth strategy may place a strain on our management, operational and financial resources, as well as our information systems.\nA key element of our business strategy has been the growth of our business through acquisitions and strategic investments. However, this growth strategy may place a strain on our management, operational and financial resources, as well as our information systems and expose us to additional business and operating risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to effectively and efficiently integrate the operations, financial reporting, and personnel of acquired businesses and manage acquired businesses or strategic investments, while maintaining uniform standards and controls;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from other business concerns, the potentially negative impact of changes in management on existing business relationships and other disruptions of our business;\n\u2022\nthe risks associated with entering into businesses or markets in which we may have no or limited direct prior experience;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees, customers or suppliers of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\na decrease in our liquidity resulting from a material portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity being used to fund acquisitions and a corresponding increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to fund acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe ability to integrate the IT systems and technology of acquired businesses into our existing infrastructure and manage those systems and technologies that cannot be effectively integrated;\n\u2022\nthe requirement to write down acquired assets in the event the acquired business or strategic investment is worth less than we paid for or invested in it;\n\u2022\ncapital expenditure requirements exceeding our estimates;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of material liabilities, exposure to litigation, regulatory noncompliance or unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses, and no or limited indemnities from sellers or ongoing indemnity obligations to purchasers; and\n\u2022\nthe need to implement internal controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls, procedures and policies.\nThese risks may result in an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition or result in costs that outweigh the financial benefit of such opportunities. Furthermore these acquisitions or strategic investments may result in us incurring substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses or consummating potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities to fund the required capital investment. This could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, inhibit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise restrict our operations.\nWe may not be able to fully recognize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions and other strategic investments.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have been pursuing acquisition opportunities complementary to our business portfolio. From time to time, we may also enter into strategic investments such as joint venture arrangements or equity investments intended to complement or expand a portion of our business. Our ability to successfully implement our growth strategy depends on our ability to find attractive acquisition candidates or strategic investments and consummate such transactions on economically acceptable terms. Before making acquisitions or other strategic investments, we conduct due diligence that we deem reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to each investment. We rely, among other things, on our due diligence, representations and warranties of the sellers, financial statements and records of target businesses to establish the anticipated revenues and expenses and whether the acquisitions or strategic investments will meet our internal guidelines for current and future potential returns. Our due diligence investigation and other information we rely on with respect to any opportunity may not reveal or highlight all relevant risks and issues that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating such opportunity. Consequently, these transactions could result in (i) an adverse impact on our overall profitability if the acquisitions or strategic investments do not achieve the projected financial results, (ii) unanticipated costs that may impact our results of operations, and (iii) increased demands on our cash resources that may, among other things, impact our ability to explore other opportunities. If our acquisitions or strategic investments do not achieve the financial results anticipated, it could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nIntegration difficulties, or any other factors that make operating the acquired businesses more challenging following the completion of the acquisitions, may also prevent us from realizing the benefits from the recent acquisitions or any future acquisitions to the extent, or in the time frame, anticipated by us. We have incurred, and expect to continue incurring, expenses related to the integration of acquisitions. These transaction and integration expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings and synergies that we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings related to the integration of the acquired businesses following the completion of the recent acquisitions. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a result of our acquisition activity, our goodwill and intangible assets have increased substantially in recent years and we have incurred, and may continue to incur, impairments to goodwill or intangible assets.\nWhen we acquire a business, a substantial portion of the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. In accordance with applicable acquisition accounting rules, we are required to record as goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet the amount by which the purchase price exceeds the net fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired as of the acquisition date. As of December 31, 2017, we had goodwill of $845.5 million and net intangible assets of $279.7 million. We review our indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists. Factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or intangible assets may be impaired include a decline in our stock price or market capitalization, reduced estimates of future cash flows in our annual operating plan and slower growth rates in our industry.\nOur valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on a number of factors including industry experience, internal benchmarks, and the economic environment. We also rely heavily on projections of future operating performance, however, if our annual operating plan is not achieved or if there are other variations to our estimates and assumptions, particularly in the expected growth rates and profitability embedded in our cash flow projections or the discount rate used, there is the potential for a partial or total impairment of the carrying amount of goodwill within one or more of our reporting units.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded an impairment charge of $91.9 million, of which $72.3 million was attributable to the write-off of goodwill in our marine segment, and $7.9 million associated with intangible assets, primarily customer relationships. The impairment within our marine segment was driven principally by growing competitive pressures in maritime markets, including the decline of maritime shipping volumes along with lower demand for price risk management products and our ultimate decision in the fourth quarter to exit our marine business in certain international markets. See Note 7 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Due to continual changes in market and general business conditions, we cannot predict whether, and to what extent, our goodwill and long-lived intangible assets may be impaired in future periods. Any resulting impairment loss would have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nAdverse conditions or events affecting the aviation, marine and land transportation industries may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is focused on the marketing of fuel and other related products and services primarily to the aviation, marine and land transportation industries, which are generally affected by economic cycles. Therefore, weak economic conditions can have a negative impact on the business of our customers which may, in turn, have an adverse effect on our business. For example, our marine segment has been significantly impacted by the economic conditions adversely affecting the maritime industry. In addition, any political instability, terrorist activity, military action that disrupts shipping, flight operations or land transportation or natural disasters and other weather-related events, will adversely affect our customers and may reduce the demand for our products and services. For example, during 2017, an earthquake in Mexico and Hurricanes Irma and Harvey resulted in business interruptions and supply disruptions which negatively impacted our results of operations. Our business could also be adversely affected by increased merger activity in the aviation, marine or land transportation industries, which may reduce the number of customers that purchase our products and services, as well as the prices we are able to charge for such products and services. For example, the shipping industry has gone through a period of significant consolidation in recent years, which has created a concentration of volume among a smaller number of shipping companies. Larger shipping companies often have greater leverage, are more sophisticated purchasers of fuel and have greater ability to buy directly from major oil companies, which can negatively impact our value proposition to these types of customers.\nIn addition, the aviation, marine and land transportation industries are subject to continuing changes in laws and regulations, including environmental regulations mandating or incentivizing alternative energy sources or attempting to control or limit emissions and pollution. Complying with these and other laws and regulations may require capital expenditures by our customers or otherwise increase our customers\u2019 operating costs, which could in turn, reduce the demand for our products and services or impact the pricing or availability of the products we sell. Although the ultimate impact of any regulations is difficult to predict accurately, they could have a material adverse effect on our business or on the businesses of our customers.\nOur business is subject to seasonal variability, which can cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate and adversely affect the market price of our shares.\nOur operating results are subject to seasonal variability. Seasonality results from numerous factors, including traditionally higher demand for natural gas and home heating oil during the winter months and for aviation and land fuel during the summer months, as well as other seasonal weather patterns. As such, our results for the second and third quarters of the year in our aviation segment tend to be the strongest and our results for the fourth and first quarters of the year in our land segment tend to be the strongest. However, extreme or unseasonable weather conditions can substantially reduce demand for our products and services which can, in turn, adversely impact our results of operations. There can be no assurance that seasonal variability factors will continue in future periods. Accordingly, results for any one quarter may not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be achieved for any other quarter or for the full fiscal year. These seasonal fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may adversely affect the market price of our shares.\nWe may be unable to realize the level of benefit that we expect from our restructuring activities and cost reduction initiatives which may hurt our profitability and our business otherwise might be adversely affected.\nWe continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and seek the most cost effective means and efficient structure to serve our customers and suppliers and respond to changes in the markets in which we operate. In line with this commitment, we have in the past and are likely to, in the future, divest of certain non-core assets, exit lines of businesses that are not achieving the desired return on investment, or otherwise restructure certain of our operations in an effort to improve cost competitiveness and profitability. For example, we exited our rail business in the fourth quarter of 2017. We also engaged in cost reduction initiatives, principally in our marine segment in 2016 and throughout our organization in 2017, and restructuring activities during the fourth quarter of 2017. We continue to evaluate additional restructuring activities, cost reduction opportunities and potential divestitures.\nWe may not be able to achieve the level of benefit that we expect to realize from our past or future restructuring activities or divestitures. We may also materially alter various aspects of our business, or our business model, and there can be no assurance that any such changes will be successful or that they will not ultimately have a negative effect on our business and results of operations. Finally, restructuring activities and divestitures may result in restructuring charges and material write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in the market price of fuel may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFuel prices are impacted by many factors beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nglobal economic conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in global crude oil and natural gas prices;\n\u2022\nexpected and actual supply and demand for fuel;\n\u2022\nthe ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) to set and maintain production levels for oil;\n\u2022\noil and gas production levels by non-OPEC countries;\n\u2022\ngeopolitical conditions;\n\u2022\nlaws and regulations related to environmental matters, including those mandating or incentivizing alternative energy sources or otherwise addressing global climate change;\n\u2022\nchanges in pricing or production controls by various organizations and oil producing countries;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption or supply;\n\u2022\nenergy conservation efforts;\n\u2022\nprice and availability of alternative fuels and energy sources; and\n\u2022\nweather.\nIf fuel prices increase, our customers may not be able to purchase as much fuel from us because of their credit limits with us and the resulting adverse impact on their business could cause them to be unable to make payments owed to us for fuel purchased on credit. They may also choose to reduce the amount of fuel they consume in their operations to reduce costs or comply with new environmental regulations to obtain associated incentives. For example, in the shipping industry a number of container ships sail at reduced speeds, known as \u201cslow steaming,\u201d to conserve fuel and reduce carbon emissions. In any such event, the volume of orders from our customers may thereafter decrease and we may not be able to replace lost volumes with new or existing customers. In addition, if fuel prices increase, our own credit limits could prevent us from purchasing enough fuel from our suppliers to meet our customers\u2019 demands or could require us to prepay for fuel purchases which would impair our liquidity.\nConversely, extended periods of low fuel prices, particularly when coupled with low price volatility, such as we experienced during 2016 and 2017, can also have an adverse effect on our results of operations and overall profitability. This outcome can be due to a number of factors, including reduced demand from our customers involved in the oil exploration sector and for our price risk management products. Low fuel prices also facilitate increased competition by reducing financial barriers to entry and enabling existing, lower-capitalized competitors to conduct more business as a result of lower working capital requirements.\nFinally, we maintain fuel inventories for competitive or logistical reasons. Because fuel is a commodity, we have no control over the changing market value of our inventory although we may manage or hedge this price exposure with derivatives. Our inventory is valued using the weighted average cost methodology and is stated at the lower of average cost or market. A rapid decline in fuel prices could cause our inventory value to be higher than market, resulting in our inventory being marked down to market or the inventory itself sold at lower prices. While we attempt to mitigate these fluctuations through hedging, such hedges may not be fully effective. Accordingly, if the market value of our inventory is less than our average cost and to the extent our hedges are not effective at mitigating fluctuations in prices, we could record a write down of inventory on hand and incur a non-cash charge or suffer losses as fuel is sold, which could adversely impact our earnings.\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business and future operating results.\nBecause we offer fuel products and services on a worldwide basis, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Our business and future operating results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures and import, export and other licensing requirements, which could increase our costs or prevent us from doing certain business internationally;\n\u2022\nthe costs of hiring and retaining senior management for overseas operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, which could reduce our productivity;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory requirements, which may be costly and require significant time to implement;\n\u2022\nlaws restricting us from repatriating profits earned from our activities within foreign countries, including making distributions;\n\u2022\ngovernmental actions that may result in the deprivation of our contractual rights or the inability to obtain or retain authorizations required to conduct our business;\n\u2022\npolitical risks, including changes in governments; and\n\u2022\nterrorism, war, civil unrest and natural disasters and other weather-related events.\nIn particular, we operate in certain international markets which have been plagued by corruption and have uncertain regulatory environments, either of which could have a negative impact on our operations there. Furthermore, many countries in which we operate have historically been, and may continue to be, susceptible to recessions or currency devaluation.\nWe also operate in certain high-risk locations that have been experiencing military action, terrorist activity or continued unrest which could disrupt the supply of fuel or otherwise disrupt our operations in those areas. An act of terror could result in disruptions of fuel supply and oil markets, and our facilities could be direct or indirect targets. Terrorist activity may also hinder our ability to transport fuel if our means of transportation become damaged as a result of an attack. In these high-risk locations, we may also incur substantial operating costs, including maintaining the safety of our personnel. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel in these locations and there is a risk of serious injury or loss of life of employees or subcontractors.\nFinally, the U.S. may potentially withdraw from or renegotiate various trade agreements and take other actions that would change current trade policies of the U.S. We cannot predict the impact, if any, of these or other proposed changes to our business. However, it is possible that these proposed changes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. It is likely that some policies adopted by the new administration will benefit us and others will negatively affect us. Until we know what changes are enacted, we will not know whether in total we benefit from, or are negatively affected by such changes.\nMaterial disruptions in the availability or supply of fuel would adversely affect our business.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to purchase, sell and coordinate delivery of fuel and related services to our customers. Political instability, natural disasters and other weather-related events, transportation, terminal or pipeline capacity constraints, terrorist activity, piracy, military action or other similar conditions or events may disrupt the availability or supply of fuel. Decreased availability or supply of fuel or other petroleum products may have a negative impact on our sales and margins and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we rely on a single or limited number of suppliers for the provision of fuel and related products and services in certain markets. These parties may have significant negotiating leverage over us, and if they are unable or unwilling to supply us on commercially reasonable terms, our business would be adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition and, if we are not able to effectively compete in our markets, our revenues and profits may decrease.\nCompetitive pressures in our markets could adversely affect our competitive position, leading to a possible loss of market share or a decrease in prices, either of which could result in decreased revenues and profits. Our competitors are numerous, ranging from large multinational corporations, which have significantly greater capital resources than we do, to relatively small and specialized firms. Industry developments, such as fuel price transparency, procurement technology tools and increasing customer sophistication may, over time, reduce demand for our services and thereby exacerbate the competition. In addition to competing with resellers, we also compete with the major oil producers that market fuel and other energy products directly to the large commercial airlines, shipping companies and commercial and industrial users. Although many major oil companies have been divesting their downstream assets, some continue to compete with us in certain markets while others may decide to reenter the market in the future. Our business could be adversely affected because of increased competition from these oil companies, who may choose to increase their direct marketing in order to compete with us or provide less advantageous price and credit terms to us than to our fuel reseller competitors.\nIf we are unable to retain our senior management and key employees, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nOur ability to maintain our competitive position is largely dependent on the services of our senior management and key personnel. Although we have employment or severance agreements with certain of our key employees, these agreements do not prevent those individuals from ceasing their employment with us at any time. If we are unable to retain existing senior management and key personnel, or to attract other qualified senior management and key personnel on terms satisfactory to us, our business could be adversely affected. While we maintain key man life insurance with respect to certain members of senior management, our coverage levels may not be sufficient to offset any losses we may incur and there is no assurance that we will continue to maintain key man life insurance in the future.\nOur failure to comply with the requirements of our Credit Facility and Term Loans could adversely affect our operating flexibility.\nWe have the ability to borrow money pursuant to a Credit Facility and Term Loans that impose certain operating and financial covenants on us, which, among other things, restrict our ability to (i) pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments, (ii) incur additional debt, (iii) create liens, (iv) sell assets, and (v) engage in mergers or acquisitions. Our failure or inability to comply with the requirements of these facilities, including meeting certain financial ratios or other covenants, could limit the availability under our Credit Facility or result in an event of default. An event of default, if not cured or waived, would permit acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness under these facilities, could trigger cross defaults under other agreements to which we are a party (such as certain derivative contracts), and would impair our ability to obtain working capital advances and letters of credit, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by legislation and competition from other energy sources and new or advanced technology.\nFuel competes with other sources of energy, some of which are less costly on an equivalent energy basis. There have been significant governmental incentives and consumer pressures to increase the use of alternative fuels in the United States and abroad. A number of automotive, industrial and power generation manufacturers are developing more fuel efficient engines, hybrid engines and alternative clean power systems. The more successful these alternatives become as a result of governmental incentives or regulations, technological advances, consumer demand, improved pricing or otherwise, the greater the potential negative impact on pricing and demand for our products and services and accordingly, our profitability.\nOn March 28, 2017, the U.S. President signed an executive order directing the Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) and other executive agencies to review their existing regulations, orders, guidance documents and policies that potentially burden the development of energy resources. It remains unclear how and to what extent these executive actions will impact the regulation of GHG emissions at the federal level. Even if federal efforts in this area are slow, state, local and/or foreign governments may enact legislation or regulations that attempt to control or limit GHGs such as carbon dioxide. Such laws or regulations could impose costs tied to carbon emissions, operational requirements or restrictions, or additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities. They could also provide a cost advantage to alternative energy sources, result in other costs or requirements, such as costs associated with the adoption of new infrastructure and technology to respond to new mandates, or impose costs or restrictions on end users of fuel. For example, some of our customers in the transportation industry may be required to purchase allowances or offsets or incur other costs to comply with existing or future requirements relating to GHG. Finally, the focus on climate change could also negatively impact the reputation of our fuel products or services. The occurrence of any of the foregoing events could put upward pressure on the cost of fuel relative to other energy sources, increase our costs and the prices we charge our customers, reduce the demand for our products, and therefore adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nInsurance coverage for some of our operations may be insufficient to cover losses, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe maintain insurance to cover various risks associated with the operation of our business. Certain risks, however, such as environmental risks, are not fully insurable and our insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses, costs, or liabilities. Accordingly, our insurance policies may not adequately cover or may have exclusions of coverage for certain losses. Therefore, our insurance coverage may not be available or, if available, may not be adequate to cover claims that may arise.\nFurthermore, our ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance and the cost of such insurance may be affected by significant claims and conditions in the insurance market over which we have no control. If the cost of insurance\nincreases, we may decide to discontinue certain insurance coverage, reduce our level of coverage or increase our deductibles/retentions in order to offset the cost increase. In addition, our existing types and levels of insurance coverage could become difficult or impossible to obtain in the future. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance, the loss of insurance coverage or a material increase in the cost of insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCurrent and future litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are currently, and may in the future be, involved in legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Lawsuits and other administrative or legal proceedings as well as any governmental investigations can involve substantial costs, including the costs associated with investigation, litigation and possible settlement, judgment, penalty or fine. Although we generally maintain insurance to mitigate certain exposures, costs associated with lawsuits or other legal proceedings may exceed the limits of insurance policies, which could adversely impact our results of operations. Furthermore, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected if a judgment, penalty or fine is not fully covered by insurance.\nFluctuations in foreign exchange rates could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe majority of our business transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. In particular markets, however, payments to certain of our fuel suppliers and from certain of our customers are denominated in local currency. We also have certain liabilities, primarily for local operations, including income and transactional taxes, which are denominated in foreign currencies. This subjects us to foreign currency exchange risk. For example, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound and other currencies may harm our results of operations as the local currency results of our U.K. operations may translate into fewer U.S. dollars. Currency fluctuations could also impact our customers based outside of the U.S., who may closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budgets on our products and services, which in turn, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough we generally use hedging strategies to manage and minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange risk when available, these hedges may be costly and at any given time, only a portion of this risk may be hedged. Accordingly, our exposure to this risk may be substantial and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could adversely affect our profitability.\nThe U.K.\u2019s proposed withdrawal from the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d) could harm our business and financial results.\nOn June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which British voters approved an exit from the E.U., commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d. On March 29, 2017, the U.K. government initiated the exit process under Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union, commencing a period of up to two years for the U.K. and the other E.U. member states to negotiate the terms of the withdrawal. Uncertainty over the terms of the U.K\u2019s departure from the E.U. could cause political and economic uncertainty in the U.K. and the rest of Europe, which could harm our business and financial results. A withdrawal could, among other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the U.K. and the E.U., undermine bilateral cooperation in key geographic areas and significantly disrupt trade between the U.K. and the E.U. or other nations as the U.K. pursues independent trade relations. These factors pose a risk to the overall U.K. economy and as a result, our operations in the U.K., particularly in our land segment, as well as our global operations, could be adversely impacted.\nFinally, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate. We may incur additional costs and expenses as we adapt to such potentially divergent regulatory frameworks. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to E.U. or other markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. would have and how such withdrawal would affect us. In addition, Brexit may lead other E.U. member countries to consider referendums regarding their E.U. membership. Adverse consequences concerning Brexit or the E.U. could include deterioration in global economic conditions, instability in global financial markets, political uncertainty, continued volatility in currency exchange rates, or adverse changes in the cross-border agreements currently in place, any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future.\nCurrent and proposed derivatives legislation and rulemaking could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe Dodd Frank Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010 (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) provides for federal regulation of the over the counter derivative markets both for commodities and securities, and gives the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) and the SEC broad authority to regulate such markets and their participants. This includes, among others, derivative transactions linked to crude oil, refined products and natural gas prices. The Dodd-Frank Act and the rules being promulgated thereunder subject certain swap participants to capital and margin requirements and business conduct standards. If we or our derivatives counterparties are subject to additional requirements imposed as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, this may increase our transaction costs or make it more difficult for us to enter into hedging transactions on favorable terms. Our inability to enter into hedging transactions on favorable terms, or at all, could increase our operating expenses and put us at increased exposure to risks of adverse changes in energy commodities prices. Further, on December 30, 2016, the CFTC re-proposed new position limits rules for public comment, which would limit trading in options, futures, and swaps contracts related to certain agricultural, metal, and energy commodities, including energy commodities in which we currently engage in derivative transactions, and solicited public comment. These rules have not been finalized, and we cannot currently predict whether or when the re-proposed rules will be adopted, in what form the rules will be adopted, or the effect of the final rules, if any, on our businesses. Any such regulations could also subject our derivatives counterparties to limits on commodity positions and thereby have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business or on the cost of our hedging activity.\nIn addition, other legislation regulating the use of derivatives that certain foreign jurisdictions have adopted or are in the process of adopting, could have a material adverse effect on our business. One of the most significant pieces of E.U. financial services legislation in recent years, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (\u201cMiFID II\u201d) and the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (\u201cMiFIR\u201d), went into effect on January 3, 2018. As a result of the available exemptions from MiFID II licensing, we have experienced minimal disruption in our ability to continue to conduct our business since these regulations took effect in the E.U., although we will continue to evaluate the availability of these exemptions as our business grows or changes in the future. In addition, new rules have been enacted on \u201cposition limits,\u201d which places a limit on the number of commodity derivative contracts we can hold at one time that are traded on a \u201cE.U. trading venue,\u201d which includes E.U. Regulated Markets/Exchanges. Although we do not believe these limits pose an immediate threat on our ability to hedge risk or carry out our existing business activities, we will continue to evaluate whether these limits may have any adverse business impact in the future.\nAny new (or newly implemented) regulations and international legislation could:\n\u2022\nmaterially increase the cost of our derivative contracts (including through requirements to post collateral, which could adversely affect our cash flows and liquidity, or require us to obtain licenses and subject us directly or indirectly to additional reporting and other requirements);\n\u2022\nmaterially alter the terms of our derivative contracts;\n\u2022\nreduce our ability to offer derivative and other price management products to our customers;\n\u2022\nrequire that we limit our derivatives activities to avoid being subject to burdensome requirements and regulations;\n\u2022\nreduce the demand for our price risk management services;\n\u2022\nreduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter;\n\u2022\nincrease price volatility in the commodities we buy and sell (and derivatives related to those commodities);\n\u2022\naffect cash flow and liquidity due to margin calls;\n\u2022\nreduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing commodity price contracts; and\n\u2022\nincrease our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties.\nIf the increased cost of derivative contracts is substantial or we reduce or limit our derivatives activities as a result of any such legislation or rules, our profitability and results of operations could be adversely affected. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition, and our results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 75070, "SIC": 5172, "TIC": "INT"}
