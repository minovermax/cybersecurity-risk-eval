You should carefully consider these risk factors, together with all of the other information included herewith, before you decide to purchase shares of our common stock. The occurrence of any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Technologies\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales of our subscription-based digital media analytics products. If our customers terminate or fail to renew their subscriptions, our business could suffer.\nWe currently derive a significant portion of our revenues from our subscription-based digital media analytics products. Subscription-based products accounted for 90%, 87%, and 87% of our revenues in the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. If our customers terminate their subscriptions for our products, do not renew their subscriptions, delay renewals of their subscriptions or renew on terms less favorable to us, our revenues could decline and our business could suffer.\nOur customers have no obligation to renew after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which is typically one year, and we cannot be assured that current subscriptions will be renewed at the same or higher dollar amounts, if at all. Some of our customers have elected not to renew their subscription agreements with us in the past. If we experience a change of control, as defined in such agreements, some of our customers also have the right to terminate their subscriptions. Moreover, some of our major customers have the right to cancel their subscription agreements without cause at any time. Furthermore, our new subscription products, for which revenue is recognized based on impressions used, may be subject to higher fluctuations in revenue.\nGiven unpredictable economic conditions, our limited historical data with respect to rates of customer subscription renewals, and the usage volumes for our impression based products, we may have difficulty accurately predicting future customer renewal rates. Our customer renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our products, the costs or functionality of our products, the prices or functionality of products offered by our competitors, the health of the digital advertising marketplace, mergers and acquisitions affecting our customer base, general economic conditions or reductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels.\nOur quarterly results of operations may fluctuate in the future. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur quarterly results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. If our quarterly revenues or results of operations do not meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. In addition to the other risk factors set forth in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly revenues or results of operations include:\n\u2022\nour ability to increase sales to existing customers and attract new customers;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss or reduction in spending by significant customers;\n\u2022\nchanges in our customers' subscription renewal behaviors and spending on projects;\n\u2022\nthe impact on our contract renewal rates, for both our subscription and project-based products, caused by our customers\u2019 budgetary constraints, competition, customer dissatisfaction, customer corporate restructuring or change in control, or our customers\u2019 actual or perceived lack of need for our products;\n\u2022\nthe timing of contract renewals, delivery of products and duration of contracts and the corresponding timing of revenue recognition as well as the effects of revenue derived from recently-acquired companies;\n\u2022\nvariations in the demand for our products and the implementation cycles of our products by our customers;\n\u2022\nthe challenges of persuading customers to switch from incumbent service providers;\n\u2022\nthe timing of revenue recognition for usage-based or impression-based products;\n\u2022\nthe mix of subscription-based versus project-based revenues;\n\u2022\nthe effect of revenues generated from significant one-time projects or the loss of such projects;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success of new product introductions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing and discounting policies or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe impact of our decision to discontinue certain products;\n\u2022\nour failure to accurately estimate or control costs - including those incurred as a result of investments, other business or product development initiatives, litigation, and the integration of acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of capital expenditures and operating costs related to the maintenance and expansion of our operations and infrastructure;\n\u2022\nour ability to estimate revenues and cash flows associated with business operations acquired by us;\n\u2022\nthe uncertainties associated with the integration of acquired new lines of business, and operations in countries in which we may have little or no previous experience;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of organizational restructuring, in particular in international jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nservice outages, other technical difficulties or security breaches;\n\u2022\nlimitations relating to the capacity of our networks, systems and processes;\n\u2022\nmaintaining appropriate staffing levels and capabilities relative to projected growth, or retaining key personnel as a result of the integration of recent acquisitions;\n\u2022\nadverse judgments or settlements in legal disputes;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which certain expenses are more or less deductible for tax purposes, such as share-based compensation that fluctuates based on the timing of vesting and our stock price;\n\u2022\nthe timing of any additional reversal of our deferred tax valuation allowance;\n\u2022\nadoption of new accounting pronouncements; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, political, industry and market conditions and those conditions specific to Internet usage and online businesses.\nWe believe that our quarterly revenues and results of operations on a year-over-year and sequential quarter-over-quarter basis may vary significantly in the future and that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. Investors are cautioned not to rely on the results of prior quarters as an indication of future performance.\nOur business may be harmed if we deliver, or are perceived to deliver, inaccurate information to our customers, to the media or to the public generally.\nIf the information that we provide to our customers, to the media, or to the public is inaccurate, or perceived to be inaccurate, whether due to methodological approaches, errors, bias towards certain available data sources or partners, our brand may be harmed. The information that we collect or that is included in our databases and the statistical projections that we provide to our customers, to the media or to the public may contain or be perceived to contain inaccuracies. These projections may be viewed as an important measure for the success of certain businesses, especially those businesses with a large online presence. Any inaccuracy or perceived inaccuracy in the data reported by us about such businesses may potentially affect the market perception of such businesses and result in claims or litigation around the accuracy of our data, or the appropriateness of our methodology, may encourage aggressive action on the part of our competitors, and could harm our brand. Any dissatisfaction by our customers or the media with our digital media analytics, measurement or data collection and statistical projection methodologies, whether as a result of inaccuracies, perceived inaccuracies, or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers and could harm our brand. Additionally, we could be contractually required to pay damages, which could be substantial, to certain of our customers if the information we provide to them is found to be inaccurate. Any liability that we incur or any harm to our brand that we suffer because of actual or perceived irregularities or inaccuracies in the data we deliver to our customers could harm our business.\nMaterial defects or errors in our data collection and analysis systems could damage our reputation, result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell our products.\nOur data collection and analysis systems are complex and may contain material defects or errors. In addition, the large amount of data that we collect may make our data collection and analysis systems more susceptible to defects or errors. Moreover, as technology evolves across digital platforms, we may not be able to continue collection of certain data, due to technological, privacy or other reasons.\nFurthermore, we may become increasingly dependent upon third-party data provided by strategic partners for key elements of our data sets. If our partners do not apply rigorous standards to their data collection methodology and actions, notwithstanding our best efforts, we may receive third-party data that is inaccurate or defective.\nOur customers rely on our data collection and analysis software and systems to gain business intelligence or to gain a better understanding of their internal operations or performance. Any defect in our panelist data collection software, our census collection systems, our data collection capabilities, our enterprise focused software and systems, network systems, statistical projections or other methodologies could lead to consequences that could adversely impact operating results, including:\n\u2022\nloss of customers;\n\u2022\ndamage to our brand;\n\u2022\ninterruptions in the availability of our products;\n\u2022\nsales credits, refunds or liability to our customers;\n\u2022\nlost or delayed market acceptance and sales of our products;\n\u2022\ndiversion of development resources;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of substantial costs to correct any material defect or error; and\n\u2022\nincreased warranty and insurance costs.\nOur insurance policies may not cover any claim against us for loss of data, unauthorized use of data, improper access to data, inaccuracies in data or other indirect or consequential damages and defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management\u2019s attention. Adequate insurance coverage may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. Any such developments could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may lose customers or be liable to certain customers if we provide poor service or if our products do not comply with our customer agreements.\nCertain customers choose to purchase our services because of the client service that we provide, as well as the scope of information and functionality of the products that we provide. Our failure to meet these expectations could result in the loss of customers or a reduction in their purchase of our products. In addition, we may be liable to certain of our customers for damages they may incur resulting from these events, such as loss of business, loss of future revenues, breach of contract or loss of goodwill to their business.\nIf we are unable to provide cross-media analytics, or if our cross-media analytics are incomplete or inaccurate, our ability to grow or maintain our business may be harmed.\nAs the media and advertising industry looks to evaluate advertising campaigns across various forms of media, such as television, radio, online, and mobile, the ability to measure the combined size and composition of audiences across platforms is increasingly important and demanded.\nBecause a significant proportion of advertising dollars are spent on television, access to television data is a critical component to cross-media analytics, and companies who have historically held a dominant market position measuring television: such as Nielsen in the U.S., Kantar in certain countries outside the U.S., or providers selected by joint industry committees in countries outside of the U.S., may need to be relied on to produce industry-accepted measurement across a combination of media platforms. We have entered into an agreement to acquire and to license certain Nielsen Audio panel data and technology in the U.S., which provides us with access to both television and radio data to support our cross-media services, however, if such panel data and technology is not sufficiently maintained, we may suffer a reduction in the quality of our metrics. In addition, in 2015, we entered into a strategic alliance with Kantar to collaborate on certain cross-media analystics, including television, outside the U.S. If we are unable to secure licenses to data from industry-accepted providers of television measurement outside of the U.S., our cross media analytics may be incomplete, and our ability to grow and maintain our business may be harmed.\nIf we are unable to accurately measure or gain access to information or technology measuring a media component or type at all or on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to meet our customers' demands and our business and financial performance may be harmed. Furthermore, even if we do have access to cross-media data, if we have insufficient technology, methodology or source materials to parse the information across such media components to avoid duplications at all or in a cost-effective manner, our products may be inferior to other offerings, and we may be unable to meet our customers' demands. In which case, our business and financial performance may be harmed. In particular as mobile devices and technology continue to proliferate, gaining cost-effective access to mobile data will become increasingly critical, and the difficulty in accessing these forms of data will continue to grow.\nOur business may be harmed if we change our methodologies or the scope of information we collect.\nWe have in the past and may in the future change our methodologies, the methodologies of companies we acquire, or the scope of information we collect. Such changes may result from identified deficiencies in current methodologies, development of more advanced methodologies, changes in our business plans, changes in technology used by websites, browsers, applications, servers, or media we measure, integration of acquired companies or expressed or perceived needs of our customers or potential customers. Any such changes or perceived changes, or our inability to accurately or adequately communicate to our customers and the media such changes and the potential implications of such changes on the data we have published or will publish in the future, may result in customer dissatisfaction, particularly if certain information is no longer\ncollected or information collected in future periods is not comparable with information collected in prior periods. As a result of future methodology changes, some of our existing customers or customers of acquired entities may refuse to participate, or participate only in a limited fashion, and other customers may become dissatisfied as a result of changes in our methodology and decide not to continue purchasing their subscriptions or may decide to discontinue providing us with their web beacon or other server-side information. Such customers may elect to publicly air their dissatisfaction with the methodological changes made by us, thereby damaging our brand and harming our reputation. Additionally, we expect that we will need to further integrate new capabilities with our existing methodologies if we develop or acquire additional products or lines of business in the future. The resulting future changes to our methodologies, the information we collect, or the strategy we implement to collect and analyze information, such as the movement away from pure panel-centric measurement to a hybrid of panel- and site-centric measurement, may cause additional customer dissatisfaction and result in loss of customers.\nIf we are not able to maintain panels of sufficient size and scope, or if the costs of establishing and maintaining our panels materially increase, our business could be harmed.\nWe believe that the quality, size and scope of our Internet, mobile and cross-media user panels are critical to our business. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to maintain panels of sufficient size and scope to provide the quality of marketing intelligence that our customers demand from our products. We anticipate that the cost of panel recruitment will increase with the proliferation of proprietary and secure digital media platforms (whether they be PC, mobile, tablet, or connected devices), and that the difficulty in collecting these forms of data will continue to grow which may require significant hardware and software investments, as well as increases to our panel incentive and panel management costs.\nWe may be required to establish new panels that are capable of providing us with information in the areas of mobile, tablets, and other emerging technologies on which people are consuming media and content. We anticipate that this may require significant hardware and software investments, and significant increases to our panel incentive and panel management costs. We have historically acquired new panels, and were able to capitalize the cost of such acquisition. If we are unable to use the same accounting approach in reporting the costs associated with establishing new panels needed, our panel costs may significantly increase our cost of revenues in the future. To the extent that such additional expenses are not accompanied by increased revenues, our operating margins may be reduced and our financial results could be adversely affected.\nMoreover, if we fail to maintain our existing or newly established panels of sufficient size and scope, including coverage of international markets and users of various forms of digital platforms, customers might decline to purchase our products or renew their subscriptions, our reputation could be damaged and our business could be materially and adversely affected. We expect that our panel costs may increase and may comprise a greater portion of our cost of revenues in the future. The costs associated with maintaining and improving the quality, size and scope of our panel are dependent on many factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the participation rate of potential panel members, the turnover among existing panel members and requirements for active participation of panel members, such as completing survey questionnaires.\nConcerns over privacy and the potential unauthorized disclosure of personal information, or the classification of our research software as \"spyware\" or \"adware\" may cause greater attrition within our existing research panel or may discourage potential panel members from participating in our research panels. As we seek to enforce our privacy policies, we may be required to terminate relationships with service providers whose practices we believe may not comply with our privacy policies, and have removed and may in the future remove panel members obtained through such service providers. In addition, Finally, we are currently subject to privacy and data security related claims by certain panel members in a pending class action lawsuit, and we may be so again in the future. The outcome of this litigation or the negative public reaction to the details of the litigation may make it difficult for us to attract and retain panel members.\nTo the extent we experience greater attrition in our panel than we have historically experienced, these costs would increase more rapidly. Such actions may result in increased costs, or make use less successful in retaining existing panel members and recruiting additional panel members.\nIf we fail to respond to technological developments, our products may become obsolete or less competitive.\nOur future success will depend in part on our ability to modify or enhance our products to meet customer needs, to add functionality and to address technological advancements. For example, if certain handheld mobile devices become the primary mode of receiving content and conducting transactions on the Internet, and we are unable to adapt to collect information from such devices, then we would not be able to report on online activity. To remain competitive, we will need to develop new products that address these evolving technologies and standards across the universe of digital media - including television, Internet, radio and mobile usage. However, we may be unsuccessful in identifying new product opportunities or in developing or marketing new products in a timely or cost-effective manner. In addition, our product innovations may not achieve the market penetration or price levels necessary for profitability. If we are unable to develop enhancements to, and new features for, our existing methodologies or products or if we are unable to develop new products that keep pace with rapid technological\ndevelopments or changing industry standards, our products may become obsolete, less marketable and less competitive, and our business will be harmed.\nDifficulties entering into arrangements with website owners, wireless communications operators and other entities supporting server- and census-based methodologies may negatively affect our methodologies and harm our business.\nWe believe that our methodologies are enhanced by the ability to collect information using server-based web beacon information and other census-level approaches. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to maintain relationships with a sufficient number and scope of websites in order to provide the quality of marketing intelligence that our customers demand from our products. If we fail to continue to expand the scope of our server-based data collection approaches, customers might decline to purchase our products or renew their subscriptions, our reputation could be damaged and our business could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to sell additional products to our existing customers or attract new customers, our revenue growth will be adversely affected.\nTo increase our revenues, we believe we must sell additional products to existing customers, including existing customers of acquired businesses, and regularly add new customers. If our existing and prospective customers do not perceive our products to be of sufficient value and quality, we may not be able to increase sales to existing customers and attract new customers, or we may have difficulty retaining existing customers, and our operating results will be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to effectively persuade prospective customers to buy our services in substitution for those of an incumbent service provider, our revenue growth may suffer.\nSome of our newer products and initiatives require that we persuade prospective customers, or customers of our existing products, to buy our newer products in substitution for those of an incumbent service provider. In some instances, the prospective customer may have built their systems and processes around the incumbent's products. Persuading such prospective customers to switch service providers may be difficult and require longer sales cycles, which will affect our ability to increase revenue in these areas. Moreover, the incumbent service provider may have the ability to significantly discount its services or enter into long-term agreements, which would further impede our ability to increase our revenues.\nWe may expand through investments in, acquisitions of, or the development of new products with assistance from other companies, any of which may not be successful and may divert our management\u2019s attention.\nIn recent years, we completed several strategic acquisitions. We also expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including acquiring complementary products, technologies or businesses. We also have entered into relationships with other businesses such as Kantar, Google, Yahoo and Acxiom, in order to expand our product offerings. These relationships or transactions could involve preferred or exclusive licenses, discount pricing or investments in other businesses to expand our sales capabilities. These transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations, and though these transactions may provide additional benefits, they may not be profitable immediately or in the long term. Negotiating any such transactions could be time-consuming, difficult and expensive, and our ability to close these transactions may be subject to regulatory or other approvals and other conditions that are beyond our control. Consequently, we can make no assurances that any such transactions, investments or relationships, if undertaken and announced, would be completed.\nAn acquisition, investment or business relationship may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. In particular, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel or operations of the acquired companies, particularly if the key personnel of the acquired company choose not to be employed by us, and we may have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business due to changes in management and ownership. Acquisitions may also disrupt our ongoing business, divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business. Moreover, we cannot assure you that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment or business relationship would be realized or that we would not be exposed to unknown liabilities. In connection with any such transaction, we may:\n\u2022\nencounter difficulties retaining key employees of the acquired company or integrating diverse business cultures;\n\u2022\nincur large charges or substantial liabilities, including without limitation, liabilities associated with products or technologies accused or found to infringe third party intellectual property;\n\u2022\nissue shares of our capital stock as part of the consideration, which may be dilutive to existing stockholders;\n\u2022\nbecome subject to adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges;\n\u2022\nuse cash that we may need in the future to operate our business;\n\u2022\nenter new geographic markets that subject us to different laws and regulations that may have an adverse impact on our business;\n\u2022\nexperience difficulties effectively utilizing acquired assets;\n\u2022\nencounter difficulties integrating the information and financial reporting systems of acquired foreign businesses, particularly those that operated under accounting principles other than those generally accepted in the United States prior to the acquisition by us; and\n\u2022\nincur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay.\nThe impact of any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our business or results of operations or cause the price of our common stock to decline substantially.\nFollowing an acquisition of another business, we may also be required to defer the recognition of revenue that we receive from the sale of products that we acquired, or from the sale of bundles that include products that we acquired. For instance, if we acquire a business and are not able to establish vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, for any undelivered elements in the arrangement, we may be required to defer substantial portions of revenue and delay recognition of those revenues. This may result in fluctuations in our operating results and may adversely affect both revenues and operating margins in a given period or periods.\nIn addition, we may be required to disclose audited financial statements of acquired businesses within proscribed time after the completion of the acquisition pursuant to SEC reporting requirements. If we encounter unforeseen difficulties in obtaining these audited financial statements on a timely basis and cannot obtain relief from the SEC, we may lose our eligibility to register future offerings on Form S-3, which may limit our ability to access the capital markets quickly or effectively.\nFuture acquisitions or dispositions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. In addition, acquisitions will generally result in us recognizing significant amounts of intangible assets. If we experience significant declines in operating results associated with past, or future, acquisitions, and the anticipated benefits of an acquisition are not expected to materialize, we may be required to perform impairment testing of our long-lived assets, and ultimately may be required to record an impairment charge.\nOur financial condition and results of operations could suffer if there is an additional impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives.\nWe are required to test intangible assets with indefinite lives, including goodwill, annually and on an interim basis if an event occurs or there is a change in circumstance that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of reporting units and intangible assets below their carrying values. When the carrying value of a reporting unit\u2019s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value of goodwill, a charge to operations is recorded. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset with an indefinite life exceeds its fair value, a charge to operations is recognized. Either event would result in incremental expenses for that quarter, which would reduce any earnings or increase any loss for the period in which the impairment was determined to have occurred.\nIn connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014, we determined it was necessary to record a $9.7 million non-cash impairment charge related to intangible assets associated with our mobile operator business line. The impairment was based primarily on an analysis of estimated future cash flows expected to be generated from those assets, which are classified as held for sale. In determining the impairment loss, we recorded an amount equal to the excess of the assets\u2019 carrying amount over its fair value as determined by an analysis of discounted future cash flows.\nOur goodwill impairment analysis is sensitive to changes in key assumptions used in our analysis, such as expected future cash flows, the degree of volatility in equity and debt markets, and our stock price. If the assumptions used in our analysis are not realized, it is possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. However, any such impairment would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nConcern over spyware, data breaches and privacy, including any violations of privacy laws, perceived misuse of personal information, or failure to adhere to the privacy commitments that we make, could cause public relations problems, regulatory scrutiny, and potential class action lawsuits and could impair our ability to recruit panelists or maintain panels of sufficient size and scope, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to provide our products.\nAny perception of our practices as an invasion of privacy, whether legal or illegal, may subject us to public criticism, regulatory scrutiny, and potential class action lawsuits. Media coverage and public discourse initiated by lawmakers and\nregulators have increased the sensitivity of consumers to the collection, storage or use of personal information and online usage information, and the possibility of an unauthorized use or disclosure of this information may create negative public reaction related to our business practices. A shift in public acceptance of measurement technologies such as third party cookies may have a chilling effect on businesses that collect or use online usage information generally or substantially increase the cost of maintaining a business that collects or uses online usage information, increase regulatory scrutiny and increase the potential of class action lawsuits. In response to marketplace concerns about the usage of third party cookies and web beacons to track user behaviors, the major browsers have enabled features that allow the user to limit the collection of certain data. We actively seek to prevent the inclusion of our cookies and beacons on the lists of companies whose activities are automatically blocked without prior individual review of those cookies and beacons by the end user.\nA rise in data breaches has also led to an increased awareness of data security issues and may result in an increase in legislative or regulatory requirements, which could in turn substantially increase the cost of businesses that maintain data, and increase the potential of class action lawsuits. We actively seek outside audits and reviews of our data protection policies to assure we are implementing best practices; however, these precautions may not prevent the occurrence of a data breach.\nAdditionally, there is continuing public concern regarding certain kinds of downloadable software known as \u201cspyware\u201d and \u201cadware.\u201d These concerns might cause users to refrain from downloading software from the Internet, including our proprietary technology, if they inaccurately believe our software is \u201cspyware\u201d or \u201cadware.\u201d This could make it difficult to recruit additional panelists or maintain a panel of sufficient size and scope to provide meaningful marketing intelligence. In response to general spyware and adware concerns in the marketplace, numerous programs are available, many of which are available for free, and that claim to identify, remove or block such software or activity. Some anti-spyware programs have in the past identified, and may in the future identify, our software as spyware or potential spyware applications. We actively seek to prevent the inclusion of our software on lists of spyware applications or potential spyware applications and apply best industry practices for obtaining appropriate consent from panelists, protect the privacy and confidentiality of our panelist data, and comply with existing privacy laws. However, to the extent that we are not successful, and anti-spyware programs classify our software as spyware, a potential spyware application, or third party service providers fail to comply with our privacy or data security requirements, our brand may be harmed and users may refrain from downloading these programs, may uninstall our software or pursue actions against us for damages.\nFor example, on August 23, 2011, we received notice that Mike Harris and Jeff Dunstan, individually and on behalf of a class of similarly situated individuals, filed a lawsuit against comScore in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, alleging, among other things, violations by comScore of the Stored Communications Act, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Practices Act as well as unjust enrichment. The complaint sought unspecified damages, including statutory damages per violation and punitive damages, injunctive relief and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees of the plaintiffs. In October 2012, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint which, among other things, removed the claim relating to alleged violations of the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Practices Act. On April 2, 2013, the District Court issued an order certifying a class for only three of the four claims, refusing to certify a class for unjust enrichment. On May 30, 2014, we and the plaintiffs proposed a tentative settlement subject to approval by the District Court, and on October 1, 2014, the Court issued its final approval of those terms. comScore was required to establish a settlement fund from which class member claims, attorneys\u2019 fees and incentive awards, costs, and administrative expenses will be paid. We and our insurers contributed $14 million to the fund. The settlement also requires us to alter certain portions of our privacy policy and implement certain additional protocols to ensure that our privacy practices remain consistent with our disclosures to consumers. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a loss of $3.5 million related to the settlement. Any resulting reputational harm, potential claims asserted against us or decrease in the size or scope of our panel could reduce the demand for our products, increase the cost of recruiting panelists, adversely affect our ability to provide our products to our customers or result in additional costs in the form of settlement, judgments, restrictions on our business or diversion of resources to address and defend the claims. Any of these adverse effects could harm our business and our operating results.\nDomestic or foreign laws, regulations or enforcement actions may limit our ability to collect and use information about Internet users or restrict or prohibit our product offerings, causing a decrease in the value of our products and an adverse impact on the sales of our products.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by existing or future laws or regulations of, or actions by, domestic or foreign regulatory agencies. For example, privacy concerns could lead to legislative, judicial and regulatory limitations on our ability to collect, maintain and use information about Internet users in the United States and abroad. Various state legislatures have enacted legislation designed to protect Internet users\u2019 privacy, for example, by prohibiting spyware. In recent years, similar legislation has been proposed in other states and at the federal level and has been enacted in foreign countries, most notably by tthe European Union, which adopted a privacy directive regulating the collection of personally identifiable information online and more recently, restricting the use of cookies without opt-in consent by the user, and preserving an individual's right to be forgotten. The U.S. Congress and regulators have expressed concern over the collection of Internet usage information, which\nstarted as part of a larger initiative to regulate online behavioral advertising, but which has expanded in scope to a general concern over online tracking and measurement. A similar concern has been raised by regulatory agencies in Europe. In addition, U.S. and European lawmakers and regulators have expressed concern over the use of third party cookies or web beacons to understand Internet usage. Additionally, the European Commission has issued a directive requiring the regulation of cookies throughout the European Union, which may lead to the introduction of additional regulations that may vary from country to country. Furthermore, the U.S. Federal and Trade Commission updated its regulatory interpretation related to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which applies new restrictions to the online advertising market. These laws and regulations, if drafted or interpreted broadly, could be deemed to apply to the technology we use, and could restrict our information collection methods, and the collection methods of third parties from whom we may obtain data, or decrease the amount and utility of the information that we would be permitted to collect. Even if such laws and regulations are not enacted, lawmakers and regulators may publicly call into question the collection and use of Internet or mobile usage data and may affect vendors and customers\u2019 willingness to do business with us. In addition, our ability to conduct business in certain foreign jurisdictions, such as China, is restricted by the laws, regulations and agency actions of those jurisdictions. The costs of compliance with, and the other burdens imposed by, these and other laws or regulatory actions may prevent us from selling our products or increase the costs associated with selling our products, and may affect our ability to invest in or jointly develop products in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions.\nIn addition, failure to comply with these and other laws and regulations may result in, among other things, administrative enforcement actions and fines, class action lawsuits and civil and criminal liability. State attorneys general, governmental and non-governmental entities and private persons may bring legal actions asserting that our methods of collecting, using and distributing Web site visitor information are illegal or improper, which could require us to spend significant time and resources defending these claims. For example, some companies that collect, use and distribute Web site visitor information have been the subject of governmental investigations and class-action lawsuits. Any such regulatory or civil action that is brought against us, even if unsuccessful, may distract our management\u2019s attention, divert our resources, negatively affect our public image or reputation among our panelists and customers and harm our business.\nThe impact of any of these current or future laws or regulations could make it more difficult or expensive to attract or maintain panelists, particularly in affected jurisdictions, and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAny unauthorized disclosure or theft of private information we gather could harm our business.\nUnauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information regarding Web site visitors, whether through breach of our secure network by an unauthorized party, employee theft or misuse, or otherwise, could harm our business. If there were an inadvertent disclosure of personally identifiable information, or customer confidential information, or if a third party were to gain unauthorized access to the personally identifiable or customer confidential information we possess, our operations could be seriously disrupted and we could be subject to claims or litigation arising from damages suffered by panel members or pursuant to the agreements with our customers. In addition, we could incur significant costs in complying with the multitude of state, federal and foreign laws regarding the unauthorized disclosure of personal information. Finally, any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of the information we collect could harm our reputation, substantially impair our ability to attract and retain panelists and have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe success of our business depends in large part on our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright, service mark, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights, all of which provide only limited protection. In addition, where we determine necessary, we pursue enforcement of our intellectual property rights. Such enforcement action may cause us to incur costs, distract the attention of management, and result in unfavorable public opinion or outcomes that are not in our favor, each of which could adversely affect our brand, business and results of operations. While we have filed a number of patent applications and own approximately 80 issued patents worldwide, we cannot assure you that any additional patents will be issued with respect to any of our pending or future patent applications, nor can we assure you that any patent issued to us will provide adequate protection, or that any patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, or held to be unenforceable in actions against alleged infringers. Also, we cannot assure you that any future trademark or service mark registrations will be issued with respect to pending or future applications or that any of our registered trademarks and service marks will be enforceable or provide adequate protection of our proprietary rights. Furthermore, adequate (or any) patent, trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our services are available.\nWe endeavor to enter into agreements with our employees and contractors and with parties with whom we do business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology or the reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, third parties might\nindependently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or that infringe upon our intellectual property. In addition, the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in Internet-related industries are uncertain and still evolving, both in the United States and in other countries. The protection of our intellectual property rights may depend on our legal actions against any infringers being successful. We cannot be sure any such actions will be successful, and any such action may be expensive and divert considerable attention of our management team from the normal operation of our business.\nAn assertion from a third party that we are infringing its intellectual property, whether such assertions are valid or not, could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses.\nThe Internet, mobile media, software and technology industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights, domestically or internationally. As we grow and face increasing competition, the probability that one or more third parties will make intellectual property rights claims against us increases. In such cases, our technologies may be found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. Additionally, many of our subscription agreements may require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs if we have to defend such claims and may require that we pay damages and provide alternative services if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Intellectual property claims could harm our relationships with our customers, deter future customers from subscribing to our products or expose us to litigation, which could be expensive and divert considerable attention of our management team from the normal operation of our business. Even if we are not a party to any litigation between a customer and a third party, an adverse outcome in any such litigation could make it more difficult for us to defend against intellectual property claims by the third party in any subsequent litigation in which we are a named party. Any of these results could adversely affect our brand, business and results of operations.\nWith respect to any intellectual property rights claim against us or our customers, we may have to pay damages or stop using technology found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights. We may have to seek a license for the technology, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, may significantly increase our operating expenses or may significantly restrict our business activities in one or more respects. We may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense. Any of these outcomes could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Even if we prove successful in defending ourselves against such claims, we may incur substantial expenses and the active defense of such claims may divert considerable attention of our management team from the normal operation of our business.\nThe market for digital media analytics is developing, and if it does not develop further, or develops more slowly than expected, our business will be harmed.\nThe market for digital media analytics products is still developing, and it is uncertain whether these products will maintain high levels of demand and increased market acceptance. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of companies to increase their use of such products and to continue use of such products on a long-term basis. Factors that may affect market acceptance include:\n\u2022\nthe reliability of digital media analytics products;\n\u2022\npublic concern regarding privacy and data security;\n\u2022\ndecisions of our customers and potential customers to develop digital media analytics internally rather than purchasing such products from third-party suppliers like us;\n\u2022\ndecisions by industry associations in the United States or in other countries that result in association-directed awards, on behalf of their members, of digital measurement contracts to one or a limited number of competitive vendors;\n\u2022\nthe ability to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction; and\n\u2022\nthe rate of growth in eCommerce, online advertising and digital media.\nThe market for our products may not develop further, or may develop more slowly than we expect or may even contract, all of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe depend on third parties for data that is critical to our business, and our business could suffer if we cannot continue to obtain data from these suppliers.\nWe rely on third-party data sources for information regarding certain activities such as television viewing and mobile usage, as well as for information about offline activities of and demographic information regarding our panelists. The availability and accuracy of this data is important to the continuation and development of our cross-media products, products that use server- or census-based information as part of the research methodology, and products that link online and offline\nactivity. We may be required to enter into vendor relationships, strategic alliances, or even joint ventures with some third-parties in order to obtain access to the data sources that we need. If this information is not available to us at commercially reasonable terms, or is found to be inaccurate, it could harm our reputation, business and financial performance.\nIf the digitally-based or cross-platform focused advertising and eCommerce markets develop more slowly than we expect, our business will suffer.\nOur future success will depend on continued growth in the use of digital advertising, a cross-platform focus to buying advertising campaigns, a continued increase in eCommerce spending and the proliferation of the Internet across platforms, including mobile and connected devices, for a wide variety of consumer activities. These markets are evolving rapidly, and it is not certain that their current growth trends will continue.\nThe adoption of advertising across digital platforms, particularly by advertisers that have historically relied on traditional offline media, requires the acceptance of new approaches to conducting business and a willingness to invest in such new approaches. Moreover the decision to adopt a cross-platform approach to buying advertisement campaigns, requires a change to buying approaches and a willingness to adopt new data analytics to assist in evaluating such approaches, by advertisement buyers who traditionally focus on buying advertising campaigns through one medium. Advertisers may perceive such new approaches to advertising or understanding advertising to be less effective than traditional methods for marketing their products. They may also be unwilling to pay premium rates for advertising that is targeted at specific segments of validated users based on their demographic profile or Internet behavior across digital media platforms. The digital media advertising and eCommerce markets may also be adversely affected by privacy issues relating to such targeted advertising, including advertising that makes use of personalized information or online behavioral information. Furthermore, merchants using new digital media platforms may not be able to establish digital commerce models that are cost effective and may not learn how to effectively compete with other established websites or offline merchants. In addition, consumers may not continue to shift their spending on goods and services from offline outlets to other forms of digital media. As a result, growth in the use of digital media for eCommerce may not continue at a rapid rate, or digital media may not be adopted as a medium of commerce by a broad base of customers or companies worldwide. Because of the foregoing factors, among others, the market for cross-platform-focused digital media advertising and eCommerce, may not continue to grow at significant rates. If these markets do not continue to develop, or if they develop more slowly than expected, our business may suffer.\nBecause our long-term success depends, in part, on our ability to expand the sales of our products to customers located outside of the United States, our business will become increasingly susceptible to risks associated with international operations.\nIn recent years, we acquired various businesses with substantial presence or clientele in multiple Latin American, European, Asian and Middle Eastern countries. Prior to these acquisitions, we otherwise had limited experience operating in markets outside of the United States. Our inexperience in operating our business outside of the United States may increase the risk that the international expansion efforts in which we are engaged will not be successful. In addition, conducting international operations subjects us to risks that we have not generally faced in the United States. These risks include:\n\u2022\nrecruitment and maintenance of a sufficiently large and representative panel both globally and in certain countries;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and expenses associated with tailoring our products to local markets as may be required by local customers and joint industry committees or similar industry organizations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in expanding the adoption of our server- or census-based web beacon data collection in international countries or obtaining access to other necessary data sources;\n\u2022\ndifferences in customer buying behaviors;\n\u2022\nthe burdens and expense of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing international operations - including complex and costly hiring, disciplinary, and termination requirements;\n\u2022\nthe complexities of foreign value-added taxes and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\nreduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; and\n\u2022\npolitical, social and economic instability abroad, terrorist attacks and security concerns.\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates; and\n\u2022\nincreased accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\nAdditionally, operating in international market requires significant management attention and financial resources. We cannot be certain that the investments and additional resources required to establish and maintain operations in other countries will hold their value or produce desired levels of revenues or profitability. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain and increase the size of the Internet user panel that we currently have in various countries, that we will be able to recruit a\nrepresentative sample for our audience measurement products, or that we will be able to enter into arrangements with a sufficient number of website owners to allow us to collect server-based information for inclusion in our digital media analytics products. In addition, there can be no assurance that Internet usage and eCommerce will continue to grow in international markets. In addition, governmental authorities in various countries have different views regarding regulatory oversight of the Internet.\nThe impact of any one or more of these risks could negatively affect or delay our plans to expand our international business and, consequently, our future operating results.\nOur growth depends upon our ability to retain existing large customers and add new large customers; however, to the extent we are not successful in doing so, our ability to maintain profitability and positive cash flow may be impaired.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to sell our products to large customers and on the renewal of the subscriptions of those customers in subsequent years. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we derived approximately 21%, 21% and 22%, respectively, of our total revenues from our top 10 customers. Uncertain economic conditions or other factors, such as the failure or consolidation of large customer companies, or internal reorganization or changes in focus, may cause certain large customers to terminate or reduce their subscriptions. Moreover, certain recently acquired companies, have revenues highly concentrated in a few large customers. The loss of any one or more of those customers could decrease our revenues and harm our current and future operating results. The addition of new large customers or increases in sales to existing large customers may require particularly long implementation periods and other significant upfront costs, which may adversely affect our profitability. To compete effectively, we have in the past been, and may in the future be, forced to offer significant discounts to maintain existing customers or acquire other large customers. In addition, we may be forced to reduce or withdraw from our relationships with certain existing customers or refrain from acquiring certain new customers in order to acquire or maintain relationships with important large customers. As a result, new large customers or increased usage of our products by large customers may cause our profits to decline and our ability to sell our products to other customers could be adversely affected.\nAs our international operations grow, changes in foreign currencies could have an increased effect on our operating results.\nWe operate in several countries in South America, including Brazil, Chile and Argentina as well as countries in Europe and the United Kingdom. As such, a portion of our revenues and expenses from business operations in foreign countries are derived from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our operations in those countries. As such, we have exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates associated with revenues and operating expenses of our foreign operations, but we do not currently enter into any hedging instruments that hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk. As we grow our international operations, and acquire companies with established business in international regions, our exposure to foreign currency risk could become more significant. For example, at the beginning of 2014, the U.S. Dollar to euro exchange rate was approximately $1.00 to \u20ac0.73. However, during 2014, the U.S. Dollar to euro exchange rate dropped as low as $1.00 to \u20ac0.72 and rose as high as $1.00 to \u20ac0.82. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the average U.S. Dollar to euro exchange rate was approximately $1.00 to \u20ac0.75. There can be no guarantee that exchange rates will remain constant over the long-term. In addition to the impact from the U.S. Dollar to euro exchange rate movements, we are also impacted by movements in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and various South American currencies as well as the Pound Sterling. In addition, cash held overseas would be subject to income tax withholding payments if it was repatriated to the United States. As of December 31, 2014, $14.5 million of the $43.0 million in cash on hand is held by foreign subsidiaries that would be subject to income tax withholding payments if it was repatriated to the United States. If we were to repatriate these funds to the United States, they would be subject to income tax payments ranging from 5% to 45% of the amount repatriated.\nThe market for digital marketing products is highly competitive, and if we cannot compete effectively, our revenues will decline and our business will be harmed.\nThe market for digital marketing products is highly competitive and is evolving rapidly. We compete primarily with providers of digital media intelligence and related analytical products and services. We also compete with providers of marketing services and solutions, with full-service survey providers and with internal solutions developed by customers and potential customers. Our principal competitors include:\n\u2022\nonline advertising companies that provide measurement of online ad effectiveness and ad delivery used for billing purposes, including Nielsen, DoubleClick (owned by Google), Atlas (owned by Facebook), and certain divisions and products within Kantar (owned by WPP);\n\u2022\nfull-service market research firms and survey providers that may measure online behavior and attitudes, including Harris Interactive, Ipsos, Synnovate, GFK, certain divisions and products within Kantar (owned by WPP) and Nielsen;\n\u2022\ncompanies that provide advertising technology point solutions, including DoubleVerify, Integral Ad Science, MOAT, and WhiteOps;\n\u2022\ncompanies that provide behavioral, attitudinal and qualitative advertising effectiveness, including Toluna/Nurago, DataLogix (being acquired by Oracle), Context Web's Aperture, Ipsos OTX, Dynamic Logic, Insight Express and Marketing Evolution;\n\u2022\ncompanies that provide audience ratings for TV, radio and other media that have extended or may extend their current services, particularly in certain international markets, to the measurement of digital media, including Nielsen, Arbitron (owned by Nielsen), certain divisions and products within Kantar, Rentrak and Taylor Nelson Sofres (owned by WPP);\n\u2022\nlarge and small companies that create proprietary data and analysis of consumers' online behavior, including Nielsen, Effective Measures, Gemius, Compete Inc. (owned by WPP), Google, Inc., Hitwise (owned by Experian), Quantcast, and Visible Measures;\n\u2022\nanalytical services companies that provide customers with detailed information of behavior on their own data, content, or web traffic, including Omniture (owned by Adobe), Coremetrics (owned by IBM), and WebTrends; and systems providers including Accenture, HP, Pivotal, HortonWorks, Cloudera and Terradata; and\n\u2022\nspecialty information providers for certain industries that we serve, including Manhattan Research (healthcare) and The Now Factory (telecommunications).\nSome of our current competitors have longer operating histories, access to larger customer bases and substantially greater resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns, panel retention, panel development or development of systems and technologies than we can. In addition, some of our competitors may adopt more aggressive pricing policies or have started to provide some services at no cost. Furthermore, large software companies, Internet portals and database management companies may enter our market or enhance their current offerings, either by developing competing services or by acquiring our competitors, and could leverage their significant resources and pre-existing relationships with our current and potential customers. Finally, consolidation of our competitors could make it difficult for us to compete effectively.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, we may not be able to retain and acquire customers, and we may consequently experience a decline in revenues, reduced operating margins, loss of market share and diminished value from our products.\nWe may encounter difficulties managing our growth and costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have experienced significant growth over the past several years in the U.S. and internationally. We have substantially expanded our overall business, customer base, headcount, data collection and processing infrastructure and operating procedures as our business has grown through both organic growth and acquisitions. From time to time, as a result of acquisition integration initiatives, or through efforts to streamline our operational performance, we may reduce the workforce or reassign personnel. Such actions may expose us to disruption by dissatisfied employees or employee-related claims, including without limitation, claims by terminated employees that believe they are owed more compensation than we believe these employees are due under our compensation and benefit plans, or claims maintained internationally in jurisdictions whose laws and procedures differ from those in the United States. .\nWe believe that we will need to continue to effectively manage and expand our organization, operations and facilities in order to accommodate potential future growth or acquisitions and to successfully integrate acquired businesses. If we continue to grow, either organically or through acquired businesses, our current systems and facilities may not be adequate. Our need to effectively manage our operations and cost structure requires that we continue to assess and improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. For example, we may be required to enter into leases for additional facilities or commit to significant investments in the build out of current or new facilities to support our growth. If we are unable to effectively forecast our facilities needs or if we are unable to sublease or terminate leases for unused space, we may experience increased unexpected costs. If we are not able to efficiently and effectively manage our cost structure or are unable to find appropriate space to support our needs, our business may be impaired.\nFailure to effectively expand our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our products.\nIncreasing our customer base and achieving broader market acceptance of our products will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our sales and marketing operations. We expect to continue to rely on our direct sales force to obtain new customers. We may expand or enhance our direct sales force both domestically and internationally. We believe that there is significant competition for direct sales personnel with the sales skills and technical knowledge that we require. Our ability to achieve significant growth in revenues in the future will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of direct sales personnel, and our ability to cross train our existing sales force with the sales forces of acquired businesses so that the sales personnel have the necessary information and ability to sell or develop sales prospects for both our products and the products of recently-acquired companies. In general, new hires require significant training and\nsubstantial experience before becoming productive. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as we require, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we currently operate or where we seek to conduct business. Our business will be seriously harmed if the efforts to expand our sales and marketing capabilities are not successful or if they do not generate a sufficient increase in revenues.\nIf we fail to develop our brand, our business may suffer.\nWe believe that building and maintaining awareness of comScore and our portfolio of products in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our current and future products and is an important element in attracting new customers. We will also need to carefully manage the brands used by recently acquired businesses as we integrate such businesses into our own. We rely on our relationships with the media and the exposure we receive from numerous citations of our data by media outlets to build brand awareness and credibility among our customers and the marketplace. Furthermore, we believe that brand recognition will become more important for us as competition in our market increases. Our brand\u2019s success will depend on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and valuable products to our customers at competitive prices. Our brand marketing activities may not yield increased revenues, and even if they do, any increased revenues may not offset the expenses we incur in attempting to build our brand. If we fail to successfully market our brand, we may fail to attract new customers, retain existing customers or attract media coverage to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, and our business and results of operations could suffer.\nWe have a history of significant net losses, may incur significant net losses in the future and may not achieve profitability.\nWe incurred net losses of $9.9 million, $2.3 million, and $11.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. As such we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve, sustain or increase profitability in the future, particularly if we engage in additional acquisition activity as we did in 2014, 2011 and 2010. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $93.1 million. Because a large portion of our costs are fixed, we may not be able to reduce our expenses in response to any decrease in our revenues, which would adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we expect operating expenses to increase as we implement certain growth initiatives, which include, among other things, the development of new products, expansion of our infrastructure, plans for international expansion and general and administrative expenses associated with being a public company. If our revenues do not increase to offset these expected increases in costs and operating expenses, our operating results would be materially and adversely affected. If we continue to incur significant net losses, we may not be able to realize certain deferred tax assets associated with our net operating loss carryforwards. As of December 31, 2014, we estimate our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes are approximately $27.8 million and $34.1 million, respectively. You should not consider our revenue growth in recent periods as indicative of our future performance, as our operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties.\nWe have limited experience with respect to our pricing model, and if the fees we charge for our products are unacceptable to our customers, our revenues and operating results will be harmed.\nWe have limited experience in determining the fees that our existing and potential customers will find acceptable for our products, the products of companies that we recently acquired, and any potential products that are developed as a result of the integration of our company with acquired companies. The majority of our customers purchase specifically tailored subscription packages that are priced in the aggregate. Due to the level of customization of such subscription packages, the pricing of contracts or individual product components of such packages may not be readily comparable across customers or periods. Existing and potential customers may have difficulty assessing the value of our products and services when comparing it to competing products and services. As the market for our products matures, or as new competitors introduce new products or services that compete with ours, we may be unable to renew our agreements with existing customers or attract new customers with the fees we have historically charged. As a result, it is possible that future competitive dynamics in our market as well as global economic pressures may require us to reduce our fees, which could have an adverse effect on our revenues, profitability and operating results.\nSystem failures or delays in the operation of our computer and communications systems may harm our business.\nOur success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems and the third-party data centers we use. Our ability to collect and report accurate data may be interrupted by a number of factors, including our inability to access the Internet, the failure of our network or software systems, computer viruses, security breaches or variability in user traffic on customer Web sites. A failure of our network or data gathering procedures could impede the processing of data, cause the corruption or loss of data or prevent the timely delivery of our products.\nIn the future, we may need to expand our network and systems at a more rapid pace than we have in the past. Our network or systems may not be capable of meeting the demand for increased capacity, or we may incur additional unanticipated expenses to accommodate these capacity demands. In addition, we may lose valuable data, be unable to obtain or provide data\non a timely basis or our network may temporarily shut down if we fail to adequately expand or maintain our network capabilities to meet future requirements. Any lapse in our ability to collect or transmit data may decrease the value of our products and prevent us from providing the data requested by our customers. Any disruption in our network processing or loss of Internet user data may damage our reputation and result in the loss of customers, and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on a small number of third-party service providers to host and deliver our products, and any interruptions or delays in services from these third parties could impair the delivery of our products and harm our business.\nWe host our products and serve all of our customers from data center facilities located throughout the United States and Europe. While we operate our equipment inside these facilities, we do not control the operation of these facilities, and, depending on service level requirements, we may not continue to operate or maintain redundant data center facilities for all of our products or for all of our data, which could increase our vulnerability. These facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They are also subject to break-ins, computer viruses, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct. A natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in availability of our products. We may also encounter capacity limitations at our third-party data centers. Additionally, our data center facility agreements are of limited durations, and our data center facilities have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our agreements for our various data center facilities expire at various dates through September 2018. We believe that we have good relationships with our data center facility vendors and believe that we will be able to renew, or find alternative data center facilities, at commercially reasonable terms. Although we are not substantially dependent on our data center facilities because of planned redundancies, and although we currently are able to migrate to alternative data centers, such a migration may result in an interruption or delay in service. If we are unable to renew our agreements with the owners of the facilities on commercially reasonable terms, or if we migrate to a new data center, we may experience delays in delivering our products until an agreement with another data center facility can be arranged or the migration to a new facility is completed.\nIf we or the third-party data centers that we use were to experience a major power outage, we would have to rely on back-up generators, which may not function properly, and their supply may be inadequate. Such a power outage could result in the disruption of our business. Additionally, if our current facilities fail to have sufficient cooling capacity or availability of electrical power, we would need to find alternative facilities.\nWe currently leverage a large content delivery network, or CDN, to provide services that allow us to offer a more efficient tagging methodology for certain subscription based measurement and analytics product offerings. If that service faced unplanned outage or the service became immediately unavailable, an alternate CDN provider or additional capacity in our data centers would need to be established to support the large volume of tag requests that we currently manage which would either require additional investments in equipment and facilities or a transition plan. This could unexpectedly raise the costs and could contribute to delays or losses in tag data that could affect the quality and reputation of our Media Metrix, vCE, and other data products that involve the measurement of a large amount of digitally transmitted activity across multiple providers.\nFurther, we depend on access to the Internet through third-party bandwidth providers to operate our business. If we lose the services of one or more of our bandwidth providers for any reason, we could experience disruption in the delivery of our products or be required to retain the services of a replacement bandwidth provider. It may be difficult for us to replace any lost bandwidth on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, due to the large amount of bandwidth our operations require.\nAny errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our products caused by third parties could harm our reputation and may damage our business. Interruptions in the availability of our products may reduce our revenues due to increased turnaround time to complete projects, cause us to issue credits to customers, cause customers to terminate their subscription and project agreements or adversely affect our renewal rates. Our business would be harmed if our customers or potential customers believe our products are unreliable.\nLaws related to the regulation of the Internet could adversely affect our business.\nLaws and regulations that apply to communications and commerce over the Internet are becoming more prevalent. In particular, the growth and development of the market for eCommerce has prompted calls for more stringent tax, consumer protection and privacy laws in the United States and abroad that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online. The adoption, modification or interpretation of laws or regulations relating to the Internet or our customers\u2019 digital operations could negatively affect the businesses of our customers and reduce their demand for our products. Even if such laws and regulations are not enacted, lawmakers and regulators may publicly call into question the collection and use of Internet or mobile usage data and may affect vendors and customers\u2019 willingness to do business with us.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe do not collect sales and use, value added and similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales. Sales and use, value added and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. Such tax assessments, penalties and interest or future requirements may adversely affect the results of our operations.\nIf we fail to respond to evolving industry standards, our products may become obsolete or less competitive.\nThe market for our products is characterized by rapid technological advances, changes in customer requirements, changes in protocols and evolving industry standards. For example, industry associations such as the Advertising Research Foundation, the Council of American Survey Research Organizations, the Internet Advertising Bureau, or IAB, and the Media Rating Council have independently initiated efforts to either review online market research methodologies or to develop minimum standards for online market research. In April 2011, comScore Direct was accredited by the Media Rating Council. Any standards adopted by U.S or internationally based industry associations may lead to costly changes to our procedures and methodologies. As a result, the cost of developing our digital media analytics products could increase. If we do not adhere to standards prescribed by the IAB or other industry associations, our customers could choose to purchase products from competing companies that meet such standards. Furthermore, industry associations based in countries outside of the United States often endorse certain vendors or methodologies. If our methodologies fail to receive an endorsement from an important industry association located in a foreign country, advertising agencies, media companies and advertisers in that country may not purchase our products. As a result, our efforts to further expand internationally could be adversely affected.\nThe success of our business depends on the continued growth of the Internet as a medium for commerce, content, advertising and communications.\nExpansion in the sales of our products depends on the continued acceptance of the digital media as a platform for commerce, content, advertising and communications. The use of the digital media as a medium for commerce, content, advertising and communications could be adversely impacted by delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of digital media activity, security, reliability, cost, ease-of-use, accessibility and quality-of-service. The performance of the Internet and its acceptance as a medium for commerce, content, advertising and communications has been harmed by viruses, worms, and similar malicious programs, and the Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure. If for any reason digital media does not remain a medium for widespread commerce, content, advertising and communications, the demand for our products would be significantly reduced, which would harm our business.\nWe rely on our management team and may need additional personnel to grow our business; the loss of one or more key employees or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could harm our business.\nOur success and future growth depends to a significant degree on the skills and continued services of our management team. Our future success also depends on our ability to retain, attract and motivate highly skilled technical, managerial, marketing and customer service personnel, including members of our management team. All of our employees work for us on an at-will basis. We plan to hire additional personnel in all areas of our business, particularly for our sales, marketing and technology development areas, both domestically and internationally, which will likely increase our recruiting and hiring costs. Competition for these types of personnel is intense, particularly in the Internet and software industries. As a result, we may be unable to successfully attract or retain qualified personnel. Our inability to retain and attract the necessary personnel could adversely affect our business.\nInvestors could lose confidence in our financial reports, and our business and stock price may be adversely affected, if our internal control over financial reporting is found by management or by our independent registered public accounting firm not to be adequate or if we disclose significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in those controls.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to include a report on our internal control over financial reporting in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. That report includes management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end the fiscal year. Additionally, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to issue a report on their evaluation of the operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe continue to evaluate our existing internal controls against the standards adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB. During the course of our ongoing evaluation of our internal controls, we have in the past\nidentified, and may in the future identify, areas requiring improvement, and may have to design enhanced processes and controls to address issues identified through this review. Remedying any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses that we or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify could require us to incur significant costs and expend significant time and management resources. We cannot assure you that any of the measures we may implement to remedy any such deficiencies will effectively mitigate or remedy such deficiencies. Further, if we are not able to complete the assessment under Section 404 in a timely manner or to remedy any identified material weaknesses, we and our independent registered public accounting firm would be unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective at the required reporting deadlines. If our internal control over financial reporting is found by management or by our independent registered public accountant to not be adequate or if we disclose significant existing or potential deficiencies or material weaknesses in those controls, investors could lose confidence in our financial reports, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by The NASDAQ Global Market, the Securities and Exchange Commission or other regulatory authorities and our stock price could be adversely affected.\nIn future periods, we may upgrade our financial reporting systems and implement new information technology systems to better manage our business, streamline our financial reporting and enhance our existing internal controls. We may experience difficulties if we transition to new or upgraded systems, including loss of data and decreases in productivity as our personnel become familiar with new systems. In addition, we expect that our existing management information systems may require modification and refinement as we grow and our business needs change. Any modifications could prolong difficulties we experience with systems transitions, and we may not always employ the most efficient or effective systems for our purposes. If upgrades cost more or take longer than we anticipate, our operating results could be adversely affected. Moreover, if we experience difficulties in implementing new or upgraded information systems or experience system failures, or if we are unable to successfully modify our management information systems to respond to changes in our business needs, our ability to timely and effectively process analyze and prepare financial statements could be adversely affected.\nA determination that there is a significant deficiency or material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could also reduce our ability to obtain financing or could increase the cost of any financing we obtain and require additional expenditures to comply with applicable requirements.\nOur net operating loss carryforwards may expire unutilized or underutilized, which could prevent us from offsetting future taxable income.\nWe have previously experienced \u201cchanges in control\u201d that have triggered the limitations of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code on a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards. As a result, we may be limited in the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that we can use in the future to offset taxable income for U.S. Federal income tax purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we estimate our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes are approximately $27.8 million and $34.1 million, respectively. These net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2023 for federal income tax reporting purposes and in 2015 for state income tax reporting purposes.\nIn addition, at December 31, 2014 we estimate our aggregate net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes related to our foreign subsidiaries are $15.0 million, which will begin to expire in 2017.\nWe apply a valuation allowance to certain deferred tax assets when management does not believe that it is more-likely-than-not that they will be realized. In assessing the need for any valuation allowances, we consider the reversal of existing temporary differences associated with deferred tax assets and liabilities, future taxable income, tax planning strategies and historical and future pre-tax book income (as adjusted for permanent differences between financial and tax accounting items) in order to determine if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. For example, we have had several recent years of pre-tax losses, and further losses may present evidence that our net operating loss carryforwards may not be realized in future periods.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had a valuation allowance related to the deferred tax assets (primarily net operating loss carryforwards) of our foreign subsidiary in Spain that is a loss company, the deferred tax asset related to our U.S. capital loss carryforwards, and the deferred tax asset related to certain state net operating loss carryforwards. Management will continue to evaluate the deferred tax position of our U.S. and foreign companies to determine the appropriate level of valuation allowance required against our deferred tax assets.\nRestrictive covenants in the agreements governing our current and future indebtedness could restrict our operating flexibility.\nThe agreements governing our existing debt, and debt we may incur in the future, contain, or may contain, affirmative and negative covenants that materially limit our ability to take certain actions, including our ability to incur debt, pay dividends\nand repurchase stock, make certain investments and other payments, enter into certain mergers and consolidations, and encumber and dispose of assets. Credit market turmoil, adverse events affecting our business or industry, the tightening of lending standards or other factors could negatively impact our ability to obtain future financing or to refinance our outstanding indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new products or enhance our existing products, enhance our operating infrastructure and acquire complementary businesses and technologies.\nAccordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could include restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. In addition, the terms of any additional equity or debt issuances may adversely affect the value and price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to the Securities Market and Ownership of our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations and volatility, and our new stockholders may be unable to resell their shares at a profit.\nThe stock markets, in general, and the markets for technology stocks in particular, have experienced high levels of volatility. The market for technology stocks has been extremely volatile and frequently reaches levels that bear no relationship to the past or present operating performance of those companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the trading price of our common stock has been subject to significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate or decline.\nThe price of our common stock in the market may be higher or lower than the price you pay, depending on many factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. It is possible that, in future quarters, our operating results may be below the expectations of analysts or investors. As a result of these and other factors, the price of our common stock may decline, possibly materially. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include the following:\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022\nvolatility in the market price and trading volume of technology companies and of companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in expectations regarding our performance by investors or securities analysts;\n\u2022\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock or changes in financial estimates by analysts;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated developments in our competitors\u2019 businesses or the competitive landscape;\n\u2022\nactual or perceived inaccuracies in, or dissatisfaction with, information we provide to our customers or the media;\n\u2022\nlitigation involving us, our industry or both;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments;\n\u2022\nprivacy and security concerns, including public perception of our practices as an invasion of privacy;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and trends;\n\u2022\nmajor catastrophic events;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our stock;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success of new product introductions or upgrades by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies or payment terms or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nconcerns relating to the security of our network and systems;\n\u2022\nour ability to expand our operations, domestically and internationally, and the amount and timing of expenditures related to this expansion; or\n\u2022\ndepartures of key personnel.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. If our stock price is volatile, we may become the target of securities litigation, which could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources from our business. In addition, volatility, lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program, including our equity incentive program, may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting a public company, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we would not otherwise incur if we were a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission and The NASDAQ Stock Market, requires certain corporate governance practices for public companies. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to public reporting requirements and corporate governance. These rules and regulations have significantly increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time-consuming and costly. We also have incurred additional costs associated with our public company reporting requirements. If these costs do not continue to be offset by increased revenues and improved financial performance, our operating results would be adversely affected. These rules and regulations also make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage if these costs continue to rise. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified people to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions:\n\u2022\nprovide for a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;\n\u2022\nauthorize \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board of directors could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which means that all stockholder actions must be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022\nprovide for advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nAdditionally, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder and which may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company.", "PERMNO": 92102, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "SCOR"}
