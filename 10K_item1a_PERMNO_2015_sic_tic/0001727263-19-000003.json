RISK FACTORS\n\ufeff\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the exhibits hereto, you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The selected risks described below, however, are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties, not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The risk factors generally have been separated into four groups: risks related to our business, risks related to the Spin-off, risks related to our common stock and risks related to our substantial indebtedness.\n\ufeff\nThe materialization of any risks and uncertainties set forth below or identified in Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements contained in this report and our other filings with the SEC or those that are presently unforeseen could result in significant adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and \u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\u201d above.\n\ufeff\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\ufeff\nOur industry is highly competitive. Competition could reduce our share and adversely affect our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry. Changes in the sources and intensity of competition in the industry in which we operate may impact the demand for our services and may also result in additional pricing pressure. Heightened industry competition could adversely affect our business operations by eroding our competitive advantage in contractor selection and purchasing power for replacement parts, appliances and home systems. Regional and local competitors operating in a limited geographic area may have lower labor, employee benefits and overhead costs than us. The principal measures of competition in our business include customer service, brand awareness and reputation, fairness of contract terms, including contract price and coverage scope, contractor network and quality and speed of service. We may be unable to compete successfully against current or future competitors, and the competitive pressures that we face may result in reduced market share, reduced pricing, and other adverse impacts to our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nWeakening general economic conditions, especially as they may affect home sales, unemployment or consumer confidence or spending levels, may adversely impact our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nOur results of operations are dependent upon consumer spending. Deterioration in general economic conditions and consumer confidence, particularly in California, Texas, Florida and Arizona, could affect the demand for our services. Consumer spending and confidence tend to decline during times of declining economic conditions. A worsening of macroeconomic indicators, including weak home sales, higher home foreclosures, declining consumer confidence or rising unemployment rates, could adversely affect consumer spending levels, reduce demand for our services and adversely impact our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nChanges in the real estate market in particular could also affect the demand for our services as home buyers elect not to purchase our services, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Among others, the number of real estate transactions in which our services are purchased could decrease in the following situations:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nwhen mortgage interest rates are high or rising;\n\u00b7\nwhen the availability of credit, including commercial and residential mortgage funding, is limited; or\n\u00b7\nwhen real estate values are declining.\n\ufeff\nWe may not successfully implement our business strategies, including achieving our growth objectives.\n\ufeff\nWe may not be able to fully implement our business strategies or realize, in whole or in part within the expected time frames, the anticipated benefits of various growth or other initiatives. Our business strategies and initiatives, including increasing our home service plan penetration, expanding into home maintenance and improvement services, providing on-demand home services, developing a world-class data platform and pursuing selective acquisitions, are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, our financial performance is affected by changes in the services and products we offer to customers. There can be no assurance that our strategies or service and product offerings will succeed in increasing revenue and growing profitability. An unsuccessful execution of strategies, including the rollout or adjustment of any new services or products or sales and marketing plans, could cause us to reevaluate or change our business strategies and could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nWe will incur certain costs to achieve efficiency improvements and growth in our business, and we may not meet anticipated implementation timetables or stay within budgeted costs. As these efficiency improvement and growth initiatives are implemented, we may not fully achieve expected cost savings and efficiency improvements or growth rates, or these initiatives could adversely impact customer retention or our operations. Also, our business strategies may change in light of our ability to implement new business initiatives, competitive pressures, economic uncertainties or developments or other factors.\n\ufeff\nOur future success depends on our ability to attract, retain and maintain our network of third-party contractors and vendors and their performance.\n\ufeff\nOur ability to conduct our operations is in part impacted by reliance on a network of third-party contractors. Our future success and financial performance depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain third-party contractors and ensure third-party contractor compliance with our policies and standards and performance expectations. However, these third-party contractors are independent parties that we do not control, and who own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their individual businesses. If third-party contractors do not successfully operate their businesses in a manner consistent with required laws, standards and regulations, we could be subject to claims from regulators or legal claims for the actions or omissions of such third-party contractors. In addition, our relationship with our third-party contractors could become strained (including resulting in litigation) as we impose new standards or assert more rigorous enforcement practices of our existing standards and performance expectations. When a contractor relationship is terminated, there is a risk that we may not be able to enter into a similar agreement with an alternate contractor in a timely manner or on favorable terms. We could incur costs to transition to other contractors, and these costs could materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. We could also fail to provide service to our customers if we lose contractors that we cannot replace in a timely manner, which could lead to customer complaints and possible claims and litigation.\n\ufeff\nWe are also dependent on vendors for home systems, replacement appliances and parts and the ability to rely on the pricing for such goods in the contracts we negotiate with these vendors. If we cannot obtain the replacement appliances, systems or parts from vendors within our existing stable of vendors to satisfy consumer claims, we may be forced to obtain replacement appliances, systems and parts from other vendors at higher costs, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nAdverse credit and financial market events and conditions could, among other things, impede access to or increase the cost of financing, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nDisruptions in credit or financial markets could make it more difficult for us to obtain, or increase our cost of obtaining, financing for our operations or investments or to refinance our existing indebtedness, or cause existing or future debt financing sources to not give technical or other waivers under credit facility or other agreements to the extent we may seek them in the future, thereby causing us to be in default.\n\ufeff\nWeather conditions and seasonality affect the demand for our services and our results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nThe demand for our services and our results of operations are affected by weather conditions and seasonality, including, without limitation, potential impacts, if any, of climate change, known and unknown. Such seasonality causes our results of operations to vary considerably from quarter to quarter. Accordingly, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. Extreme temperatures, typically in the winter and summer months, can lead to an increase in service requests related to home systems, particularly central HVAC systems, resulting in higher service request frequency and costs and lower profitability, while mild temperatures in the winters or summers can lead to lower home systems claim frequency. For example, we experienced an increase in contract service request cost driven by a higher number of central HVAC work orders due to colder winter temperatures in the first quarter of 2018 and higher summer temperatures in the second and third quarters of 2018, as compared to historical averages, in many of the markets that we serve. Extreme or unpredictable weather conditions could materially adversely impact our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nWe may not be able to attract and retain qualified key executives or transition smoothly under our new leadership, which could adversely impact us and our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully.\n\ufeff\nThe execution of our business strategy and our financial performance will depend in significant part on our executive management team and other key management personnel. Our future success will depend in large part on our success in attracting new talent and in utilizing current, experienced senior leadership and smoothly transitioning responsibilities to, and implementing the goals and objectives of, our new management team. Any inability to attract qualified key executives in a timely manner, retain our leadership team and recruit other important personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nWe are dependent on labor availability at our customer care centers.\n\ufeff\nOur ability to conduct our operations is in part affected by our ability to increase our labor force, including on a seasonal basis at our customer care centers, which may be adversely affected by a number of factors. While we employ both domestic and overseas third-party customer care center resources to help fulfill our service and other obligations, the effectiveness of such resources may be adversely affected by the availability of labor in such other markets and the continuing viability of contract relations with such third parties. In the event of a labor shortage, we could experience difficulty in responding to customer calls in a timely fashion or delivering our services in a high-quality or timely manner and could be forced to increase wages to attract and retain associates, which would result in higher operating costs and reduced profitability. Long call and service wait times by customers during peak operating times could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nLaws and government regulations applicable to our business and lawsuits, enforcement actions and other claims by third parties or governmental authorities could increase our legal and regulatory expenses, and impact our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nOur business is subject to significant federal, state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations include but are not limited to laws relating to consumer protection, deceptive trading practices, home service plans, real estate settlement, wage and hour requirements, state contractor laws, the employment of immigrants, labor relations, licensing, building code requirements, workers\u2019 safety, environmental, privacy and data protection, securities, insurance coverages, sales tax collection and remittance, healthcare reforms, employee benefits, marketing (including, without limitation, telemarketing) and advertising. In addition, we are regulated in certain states by the applicable state insurance regulatory authority and by other regulatory bodies, such as the Real Estate Commission in Texas.\n\ufeff\nWhile we do not consider ourselves to be an insurance company, the IRS or state agencies could deem us to be taxed as such, which could adversely impact the timing of our tax payments. We cannot predict whether our operation as a stand-alone company following the separation and distribution will increase the likelihood that the IRS or any state agency may view us as an insurance company.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, U.S. Tax Reform was enacted in December 2017. This legislation made significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). U.S. Tax Reform, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including a reduction of the corporate income tax rate, a partial limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense, limitation of the deduction for certain net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income, an indefinite carryforward of certain net operating losses, limitations on certain deductions for compensation paid to certain executive offices, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time and the modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits.\n\ufeff\nWe are also subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect consumers, including laws governing consumer privacy and fraud, the collection and use of consumer data, telemarketing and other forms of solicitation. From time to time, we have received and we expect that we may continue to receive inquiries or investigative demands from regulatory bodies, including the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection and state attorneys general and other state agencies. The telemarketing rules adopted by the Federal Communications Commission pursuant to the Federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the Federal Telemarketing Sales Rule issued by the Federal Trade Commission govern our telephone sales practices. In addition, some states and local governing bodies have adopted laws and regulations targeted at direct telephone sales, i.e., \u201cdo-not-call\u201d regulations. The implementation of these marketing regulations requires us to rely more extensively on other marketing methods and channels.\n\ufeff\nVarious federal, state and local governing bodies may propose additional legislation and regulation that may be detrimental to our business or may substantially increase our operating costs, including increases in the minimum wage; environmental regulations related to climate change, equipment efficiency standards, refrigerant production and use and other environmental matters; health care coverage; or \u201cdo-not-call\u201d or other marketing regulations. It is difficult to predict the future impact of the broad and expanding legislative and regulatory requirements affecting our business and changes to such requirements may adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if we were to fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation, we could be subject to substantial fines or damages, be involved in lawsuits, enforcement actions and other claims by third parties or governmental authorities, suffer harm to our reputation, suffer the loss of licenses or incur penalties that may affect how our business is operated, any of which, in turn, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nChanges to U.S. tariff and import/export regulations may increase the costs of home systems, appliances and repair parts and, in turn, adversely impact our business.\n\ufeff\nTariff policies are under continuous review and subject to change. The current U.S. administration has voiced strong concerns about imports from countries that it perceives as engaging in unfair trade practices and could impose import duties or restrictions on components and raw materials that are applicable to our business from countries it perceives as engaging in unfair trade practices. Such duties or restrictions, or the perception that they could occur, may materially and adversely affect our business by increasing our costs or reducing global trade. For example, rising costs due to blanket tariffs on imported steel and aluminum could increase the costs of parts associated with our repair and replacement of home systems and appliances, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nMoreover, new tariffs and changes to U.S. trade policy could prompt retaliation from affected countries, potentially triggering the imposition of tariffs on U.S. goods. Such a \u201ctrade war\u201d could lead to general economic downturn or could materially and adversely affect the demand for our services, thus negatively impacting our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nDisruptions or failures in our information technology systems could create liability for us or limit our ability to effectively monitor, operate and control our operations and adversely impact our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nOur information technology systems facilitate our ability to monitor, operate and control our operations. These systems were developed in conjunction with other systems at ServiceMaster prior to the Spin-off and have been significantly changed and modified since then. Such changes and modifications to our information technology systems could cause disruption to our operations or cause challenges with respect to compliance with laws, regulations or other applicable standards. As the development and implementation of our information technology systems (including our operating systems) evolve, we may elect to modify, replace or abandon certain technology initiatives, which could result in write-downs.\n\ufeff\nAny disruption in our information technology systems, including capacity limitations, instabilities, or failure to operate as expected, could, depending on the magnitude of the problem, adversely impact our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows, including by limiting our capacity to monitor, operate and control our operations effectively. Failures of our information technology systems could also lead to violations of privacy laws, regulations, trade guidelines or practices related to our customers and associates. If our disaster recovery plans do not work as anticipated, or if the third-party vendors to which we have outsourced certain information technology, contact center or other services fail to fulfill their obligations, our operations may be adversely affected, and any of these circumstances could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nIncreases in appliances, parts and system prices and other operating costs could adversely impact our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nOur financial performance may be adversely affected by increases in the level of our operating expenses, such as refrigerants, appliances and equipment, parts, raw materials, wages and salaries, employee benefits, healthcare, contractor costs, self-insurance costs and other insurance premiums, as well as various regulatory compliance costs, all of which may be subject to inflationary and other pressures. For example, a higher mix of appliance replacements versus repairs may, in turn, increase our contract service request costs. In 2018, the impact of higher replacements increased service request costs by $15 million. Such increase in operating expenses, including service request costs, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nPrices for raw materials, such as steel and fuel, are subject to market volatility. We cannot predict the extent to which we may experience future increases in costs of fuel, chemicals, refrigerants, appliances and equipment, parts, raw materials, wages and salaries, employee benefits, healthcare, vehicle maintenance, contractor costs, self-insurance costs and other insurance premiums, as well as various regulatory compliance costs and other operating costs. To the extent such costs increase, we may be prevented, in whole or in part, from passing these cost increases through to our existing and prospective customers, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nWe depend on a limited number of third-party components suppliers. Our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be harmed if these parties do not perform their obligations or if they suffer interruptions to their own operations, or if alternative component sources are unavailable or if there is an increase in the costs of these components.\n\ufeff\nWe are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for various key components used in the services and products we offer to customers, and the cost, quality and availability of these components are essential to our services. In particular, we have five national suppliers of repair parts and home systems and appliances that each account for more than five percent of our supplier spend. We are subject to the risk of shortages, increased costs and long lead times in the supply of these components and other materials, and the risk that our suppliers discontinue or modify, or increase the price of, the components used. If the supply of these components were to be delayed or constrained, or if one or more of our main suppliers were to go out of business, alternative sources or suppliers may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. Further, if there were a shortage of supply, the cost of these components may increase and harm our ability to provide our services on a cost-effective basis. In connection with any supply shortages in the future, reliable and cost-effective replacement sources may not be available on short notice or at all, and this may force us to increase prices and face a corresponding decrease in demand for our services. In the event that any of our suppliers were to discontinue production of our key product components, developing alternate sources of supply for these components would be time consuming, difficult and costly. This would harm our ability to market our services in order to meet market demand and could materially and adversely affect our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nWe have limited control over these parties on which our business depends. If any of these parties fails to perform its obligations on schedule, or breaches or ends its relationship with us, we may be unable to satisfy demand for our services. Delays, product shortages and other problems could impair our distribution and brand image and make it difficult for us to attract new customers. If we experience significantly increased demand, or if we need to replace an existing supplier, we may be unable to supplement or replace such supply capacity on terms that are acceptable to us, which may undermine our ability to deliver our services to customers in a timely and cost-efficient manner. Accordingly, a loss or interruption in the service of any key party could adversely impact our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nIf we fail to protect the security of personal information about our customers, associates or third parties, we could be subject to interruption of our business operations, private litigation, reputational damage and costly penalties.\n\ufeff\nWe rely on, among other things, commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential information of customers, associates and third parties, such as payment cards and personal information. The systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions, and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves, all of which can put payment card data at risk, are central to meeting standards set by the payment card industry (\u201cPCI\u201d). We continue to evaluate and modify these systems and protocols for PCI compliance purposes, and such PCI standards may change from time to time.\n\ufeff\nActivities by third parties, advances in computer and software capabilities and encryption technology, new tools and discoveries and other events or developments may facilitate or result in a compromise or breach of these systems. Any compromises, breaches or errors in applications related to these systems or failures to comply with standards set by the PCI could cause damage to our reputation and interruptions in our operations, including customers\u2019 ability to pay for services and products by credit card or their willingness to purchase our services and products and could result in a violation of applicable laws, regulations, orders, industry standards or agreements and subject us to costs, penalties and liabilities. We are subject to risks caused by data breaches and operational disruptions, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber-intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists. Any cyber or similar attack we experience could damage our technology systems and infrastructures, prevent us from providing our services, erode our reputation and those of our various brands, lead to the termination of advantageous contracts, result in inaccurate reporting of financial information, result in the disclosure of confidential consumer and professional contractor information, expose us to significant liabilities for the violation of data privacy laws, result in the disclosure of confidential and sensitive business information or intellectual property, result in claims or litigation against us and/or otherwise be costly to mitigate or remedy. The frequency of data breaches of companies and governments has increased in recent years as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, although we have insurance to mitigate some of these risks, such policies may not cover the particular cyber or similar attack experienced and, even if the risk is covered, such insurance coverage may not be adequate to compensate for related losses.\n\ufeff\nThe impact of cybersecurity events experienced by third parties with whom we do business (or upon whom we otherwise rely in connection with our day-to-day operations) could have similar effects on us. Moreover, even cyber or similar attacks that do not directly affect us or third parties with whom we do business may result in a loss of consumer confidence in online and/or technology-reliant businesses generally, which could make consumers and professional contractors less likely to use or continue to use our services. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nData protection legislation is also becoming increasingly common in the United States at both the federal and state level. For example, in June 2018, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which will come into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new cause of action for data breaches. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. The burdens imposed by the CCPA and other similar laws that may be enacted at the federal and state level may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial expenditures in order to comply.\n\ufeff\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to our business.\n\ufeff\nOur ability to compete effectively depends in part on our rights to proprietary information, service marks, trademarks, trade names and other intellectual property rights we own or license, particularly our brand names, Frontdoor, American Home Shield, HSA, OneGuard and Landmark. We have not sought to register or protect every one of our marks in the United States. If we are unable to protect our proprietary information and intellectual property rights, including brand names, it could cause a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information, or to defend against claims by third parties that our products, services or activities infringe their intellectual property rights.\n\ufeff\nFuture acquisitions or other strategic transactions could negatively affect our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nOur business strategy includes the pursuit of strategic transactions, which could involve acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or assets. Any future strategic transaction could involve integration or implementation challenges, business disruption or other risks, or change our business profile significantly. Any inability on our part to consolidate and manage growth from acquired businesses or successfully implement other strategic transactions could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Any acquisition that we make may not provide us with the benefits that were anticipated when entering into such acquisition. The process of integrating an acquired business may create unforeseen difficulties and expenses, including the diversion of resources needed to integrate new businesses, technologies, products, personnel or systems; the inability to retain associates, customers and suppliers; the assumption of actual or contingent liabilities; failure to effectively and timely adopt and adhere to internal control processes and other policies; write-offs or impairment charges relating to goodwill and other intangible assets; unanticipated liabilities; and potential expense associated with litigation with sellers of such businesses. Any future disposition transactions could also impact our business and may subject us to various risks, including failure to obtain appropriate value for the disposed businesses and post-closing claims.\n\ufeff\nWe may be required to recognize impairment charges.\n\ufeff\nWe have significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets, such as trade names. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized and are subject to assessment for impairment by applying a fair-value-based test annually, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment, including:\n\u00b7\nsignificant adverse changes in the business climate, including economic or financial conditions;\n\u00b7\nsignificant adverse changes in expected operating results;\n\u00b7\nadverse actions or assessments by regulators;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated competition;\n\u00b7\nloss of key personnel; and\n\u00b7\na current expectation that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit or intangible asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of.\n\ufeff\nBased upon future economic and financial market conditions, the operating performance of our reporting units and other factors, including those listed above, we may incur impairment charges in the future. It is possible that such impairment, if required, could be material. Any future impairment charges that we are required to record could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies\u201d in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\ufeff\nWe depend on our key personnel.\n\ufeff\nOur future success depends upon our ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled individuals. Competition for well-qualified employees is intense and our ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, upon our ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees. While we have established programs to attract new employees and provide incentives to retain existing employees, no assurances can be provided that we will be able to attract new employees or retain the services of our key employees in the future.\n\ufeff\nOur business process outsourcing initiatives may increase our reliance on third-party vendors and may expose our business to harm upon the termination or disruption of our third-party vendor relationships.\n\ufeff\nOur strategy to increase profitability, in part, by reducing our costs of operations includes the implementation of certain business process outsourcing initiatives, including off-shore outsourcing of certain aspects of our call center operations. Any disruption, termination or substandard performance of these outsourced services, including possible breaches by third-party vendors of their agreements with us, could adversely affect our brands, reputation, customer relationships, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Also, to the extent a third-party vendor relationship is terminated, there is a risk of disputes or litigation and that we may not be able to enter into a similar agreement with an alternate provider in a timely manner or on terms that we consider favorable. Even if we find an alternate provider, or choose to insource such services, there are significant risks associated with any transitioning activities. In addition, to the extent we decide to terminate outsourcing services and insource such services, there is a risk that we may not have the capabilities to perform these services internally, resulting in a disruption to our business, which could adversely impact our reputation, businesses, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We could incur costs, including personnel and equipment costs, to insource previously outsourced services like these, and these costs could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nFurthermore, off-shore outsourcing of certain aspects of our call center operations may induce negative public reaction. Off-shore outsourcing is a politically sensitive topic in the United States. For example, several organizations in the United States have publicly expressed concern about a perceived association between outsourcing providers and the loss of jobs in the United States. In response to such expressions, federal legislative measures have been proposed in the past, such as limiting income tax credits for companies that off-shore American jobs. In addition, there is ongoing publicity about some negative experiences that companies have had with outsourcing, such as theft and misappropriation of sensitive client data. Such negative perceptions that may be associated with using an off-shore provider could adversely impact our reputation, businesses, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nWe may be subject to litigation or other legal proceedings, and adverse outcomes in such litigation or other legal proceedings could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe have from time to time become and expect that we may continue to be subject to litigation and various other legal proceedings, including those related to intellectual property matters, privacy and consumer protection laws, as well as stockholder derivative suits, class action lawsuits and other matters, that involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief or that might necessitate changes to our business and/or operations. The defense of these actions may be both time consuming and expensive. We will evaluate these litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we may establish reserves and/or disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as and when required or appropriate. These assessments and estimates will be based on information available to our management at the time of such assessment or estimation and will involve a significant amount of judgment. As a result, actual outcomes or losses could differ materially from initial assessments and estimates. Our failure to successfully defend or settle any litigation claim or other legal proceeding could result in liability that, to the extent not covered by insurance, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\n\ufeff\nWe depend on our real estate customer acquisition channel for a significant percentage of our sales.\n\ufeff\nOur strategic relationships with top real estate brokerages and agents and the National Association of Realtors are important to our business. These brokers and agents are independent parties that we do not control, and we cannot guarantee that our strategic partnership arrangements with them will continue at current levels or at all. An inability to maintain these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nMarketing efforts to increase sales through our real estate and DTC channels may not be successful or cost-effective.\n\ufeff\nAttracting customers, professional contractors and real estate brokers to our brands and businesses involves considerable expenditures for marketing. We have made, and expect to continue to make, significant expenditures on marketing partnerships, search engine marketing, content marketing, social media, direct mail, television and radio, print advertisements and telemarketing. These efforts may not be successful or cost-effective. Historically, we have had to increase marketing expenditures over time to attract and retain customers and professional contractors and sustain growth.\n\ufeff\nWith respect to our online marketing efforts, rapid and frequent changes in the pricing and operating dynamics of search engines, as well as changing policies and guidelines applicable to keyword advertising (which may unilaterally be updated by search engines without advance notice), could adversely affect our paid search engine marketing efforts and free search engine traffic. Such changes could adversely affect paid listings (both their placement and pricing), as well as the ranking of our brands and businesses within paid and organic search results, any or all of which could increase our marketing expenditures (particularly if free traffic is replaced with paid traffic).\n\ufeff\nIn addition, evolving consumer behavior can affect the availability of profitable marketing opportunities. For example, as traditional television viewership declines and media is increasingly consumed through various digital means, the reach of traditional advertising channels is contracting, and the number of digital advertising channels is expanding. To continue to reach and engage with customers and professional contractors and grow in this environment, we will need to identify and devote more of our overall marketing expenditures to newer digital advertising channels (such as online video and other digital platforms), as well as target customers, professional contractors and real estate brokers via these channels. Generally, the opportunities in (and the sophistication of) newer advertising channels are undeveloped and unproven relative to traditional channels, which could make it difficult for us to assess returns on our marketing investment in newer channels. Additionally, as we increasingly depend on newer digital channels for traffic, these efforts will involve challenges and risks similar to those we face in connection with our search engine marketing efforts.\n\ufeff\nLastly, we also enter into various third-party affiliate agreements in an effort to drive traffic to our various brands and businesses. These arrangements are generally more cost-effective than traditional marketing efforts. If we are unable to renew existing (and enter into new) arrangements of this nature, sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue could increase over the long-term.\n\ufeff\nNo assurances can be provided that we will be able to continue to appropriately manage our marketing efforts in response to any or all of the events and trends discussed above and the failure to do so could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\n\ufeff\nThird-party use of our trademarks as keywords in Internet search engine advertising programs may direct potential customers to competitors\u2019 websites, which could harm our reputation and cause us to lose sales.\n\ufeff\nCompetitors and other third parties purchase our trademarks and confusingly similar terms as keywords in Internet search engine advertising programs in order to divert potential customers to their websites. Preventing such unauthorized use is inherently difficult. If we are unable to protect our trademarks from such unauthorized use and curtail the use of confusingly similar terms, competitors and other third parties may drive potential online customers away from our websites to competing and unauthorized websites, which could harm our reputation and cause us to lose sales.\n\ufeff\nThe use of social media by us and other parties could result in damage to our reputation or otherwise adversely affect us.\n\ufeff\nWe increasingly utilize social media to communicate with current and potential customers, contractors, real estate brokers and employees, as well as other individuals interested in us. Information delivered by us, or by third parties about us, via social media can be easily accessed and rapidly disseminated, and could result in reputational harm, decreased customer loyalty or other issues that could diminish the value of our brand or result in significant liability.\n\ufeff\nRisks Related to the Recent Spin-Off and Our Operations as an Independent Publicly Traded Company\n\ufeff\nWe have a limited history of operating as an independent, public company, and our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\n\ufeff\nThe historical information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to our business as operated by and integrated with ServiceMaster. Our historical financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for periods prior to the Spin-off is derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of ServiceMaster and Frontdoor when it was an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of ServiceMaster. Accordingly, the historical financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for periods prior to the Spin-off does not necessarily reflect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future primarily as a result of the factors described below:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nPrior to the Spin-off, our business had been operated by ServiceMaster as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. ServiceMaster or one of its affiliates performed certain corporate functions for us. Our historical financial results for periods prior to the Spin-off reflect allocations of corporate expenses from ServiceMaster for such functions and are likely to be less than the expenses we would have incurred had we operated as a separate publicly traded company.\n\u00b7\nPrior to the Spin-off, our business had been integrated with the other businesses of ServiceMaster. We had shared economies of scope and scale in costs, employees and vendor relationships. Although we entered into a transition services agreement with ServiceMaster prior to the Spin-off, these arrangements are temporary and may not retain or fully capture the benefits that we had enjoyed as a result of being integrated with ServiceMaster and may result in us paying higher charges than in the past for these services. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u00b7\nGenerally, our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and capital expenditures, had been satisfied as part of the corporate-wide cash management policies of ServiceMaster. As a separate, independent company, we may need to obtain financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, strategic relationships or other arrangements, which may or may not be available and may be more costly.\n\u00b7\nAs a separate, independent company, the cost of capital for our business may be higher than ServiceMaster\u2019s cost of capital prior to the Spin-off.\n\u00b7\nOur historical financial information for periods prior to the Spin-off does not reflect the debt that we incurred in connection with the Spin-off.\n\u00b7\nWe had historically been able to rely on the net worth of ServiceMaster when calculating our reserve requirements as a home service plan company in certain states. As a separate, independent company, we may be required to hold more reserves than we were required to hold as a subsidiary of ServiceMaster. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u00b7\n\u2022As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) and are required to prepare our financial statements according to the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. Complying with these requirements could result in significant costs and require us to divert substantial resources, including management time, from other activities.\n\ufeff\nOther significant changes may occur in our cost structure, management, financing and business operations as a result of operating as a company separate from ServiceMaster. In particular, we are currently evaluating the optimal structure of corporate functions to support the strategic objectives of our business as an independent public entity subsequent to the Spin-off. During 2018, we incurred $4 million of these increased operating costs (\u201cdis-synergies\u201d). For the full year 2019, we currently project an approximately $3 million increase in dis-synergies compared to 2018 for an annualized increase in operating costs of approximately $7 million, which we expect to then represent our normal operating costs associated with these dis-synergies. For additional information about the past financial performance of our business and the basis of presentation of the historical consolidated and combined financial statements, see \u201cItem 6. Selected Historical Financial Data,\u201d \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our audited consolidated and combined financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\ufeff\nIf the distribution, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could be subject to significant tax liabilities and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify ServiceMaster for material taxes and other related amounts pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement.\n\ufeff\nIt was a condition to the distribution that the private letter ruling from the IRS (the \u201cIRS private letter ruling\u201d) regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters relating to the separation and distribution received by ServiceMaster remain valid and be satisfactory to the ServiceMaster board of directors and that the ServiceMaster board of directors receive one or more opinions from its tax advisors, in each case satisfactory to the ServiceMaster board of directors, regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters relating to the separation and the distribution. The IRS private letter ruling and the opinions of tax advisors were based upon and relied on, among other things, various facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of ServiceMaster and us, including those relating to the past and future conduct of ServiceMaster and us. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings is, or becomes, inaccurate or incomplete, or if ServiceMaster or we breach any of the representations or covenants contained in any of the separation-related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinions of tax advisors, the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinions of tax advisors may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.\n\ufeff\nNotwithstanding receipt of the IRS private letter ruling and the opinions of tax advisors, the IRS could determine that the distribution and/or certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions, or undertakings upon which the IRS private letter ruling or the opinions of tax advisors were based are false or have been violated. In addition, neither the IRS private letter ruling nor the opinions of tax advisors addressed all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the distribution, together with certain related transactions, qualifies as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Further, the opinions of tax advisors represented the judgment of such tax advisors and are not binding on the IRS or any court, and the IRS or a court may disagree with the conclusions in the opinions of tax advisors. Accordingly, notwithstanding receipt by ServiceMaster of the IRS private letter ruling and the opinions of tax advisors, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert that the distribution and/or certain related transactions do not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. In the event the IRS were to prevail in such challenge, we could be subject to significant U.S. federal income tax liability.\n\ufeff\nIf the distribution, together with related transactions, fails to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, in general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, ServiceMaster would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold our common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value (unless ServiceMaster and we jointly make an election under Section 336(e) of the Code with respect to the distribution, in which case, in general, (a) the ServiceMaster group would recognize taxable gain as if we had sold all of our assets in a taxable sale in exchange for an amount equal to the fair market value of our common stock and the assumption of all our liabilities and (b) we would obtain a related step-up in the basis of our assets) and, if the distribution fails to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 355, in general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, ServiceMaster stockholders who received our shares in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares.\n\ufeff\nUnder the tax matters agreement that ServiceMaster entered into with us, we are required to indemnify ServiceMaster against any additional taxes and related amounts resulting from (a) an acquisition of all or a portion of our equity securities or assets, whether by merger or otherwise (and regardless of whether we participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition), (b) other actions or failures to act by us or (c) any inaccuracy or breach of our representations, covenants or undertakings contained in any of the separation-related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinions of tax advisors. Any such indemnity obligations, including the obligation to indemnify ServiceMaster for taxes resulting from the distribution and certain related transactions not qualifying as tax-free, could be material.\n\ufeff\nU.S. federal income tax consequences may restrict our ability to engage in certain desirable strategic or capital-raising transactions after the separation.\n\ufeff\nUnder current law, a separation can be rendered taxable to the parent corporation and its stockholders as a result of certain post-separation acquisitions of shares or assets of the spun-off corporation. For example, a separation may result in taxable gain to the parent corporation under Section 355(e) of the Code if the separation were later deemed to be part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, shares representing a 50 percent or greater interest (by vote or value) in the spun-off corporation. To preserve the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the separation and distribution, and in addition to our indemnity obligation described above, the tax matters agreement restricts us, for the two-year period following the distribution, except in specific circumstances, from:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nentering into any transaction pursuant to which all or a portion of our common stock or assets would be acquired, whether by merger or otherwise;\n\u00b7\nissuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds;\n\u00b7\nrepurchasing shares of our capital stock other than in certain open-market transactions;\n\u00b7\nceasing to actively conduct certain aspects of our business; and/or\n\u00b7\ntaking or failing to take any other action that would jeopardize the expected U.S. federal income tax treatment of the distribution and certain related transactions.\n\ufeff\nThese restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that we may believe to be in the best interests of our stockholders or that might increase the value of our business.\n\ufeff\nWe may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the Spin-off, and the Spin-off may materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nWe may be unable to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the Spin-off, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all.\n\ufeff\nWe may not achieve these and other anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons, including, among others that: (a) the Spin-off required significant amounts of management\u2019s time and effort, which may have diverted management\u2019s attention from operating and growing our business; (b) following the Spin-off, we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if we were still a part of ServiceMaster; (c) following the Spin-off, our business is less diversified than ServiceMaster\u2019s business prior to the Spin-off; and (d) the other actions required to separate ServiceMaster\u2019s and our respective businesses could disrupt our operations. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the Spin-off, or if such benefits are delayed, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nWe or ServiceMaster may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that were executed as part of the Spin-off or we may fail to have necessary systems and services in place when certain of the transaction agreements expire.\n\ufeff\nIn connection with the Spin-off, we and ServiceMaster entered into a separation and distribution agreement and also entered into various other agreements, including a transition services agreement, a tax matters agreement and an employee matters agreement. The separation and distribution agreement, the tax matters agreement and the employee matters agreement determine the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the Spin-off for those respective areas and include necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations. The transition services agreement provides for the performance of certain services by ServiceMaster for the benefit of us for a limited period of time after the Spin-off. We rely on ServiceMaster to satisfy its obligations under these agreements. If ServiceMaster is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, we could incur operational difficulties or losses. Upon expiration of the transition services agreement, each of the services that are covered in such agreement will have to be provided internally or by third parties. If we do not have agreements with other providers of these services or the ability to perform these services in-house once certain transaction agreements expire or terminate, we may not be able to operate our business effectively, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nAfter the Spin-off, certain members of management, directors and stockholders may hold stock in both ServiceMaster and our Company, and as a result may face actual or potential conflicts of interest.\n\ufeff\nAfter the Spin-off, the management and directors of each of ServiceMaster and Frontdoor may own both ServiceMaster common stock and our common stock. This ownership overlap could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our management and directors and ServiceMaster\u2019s management and directors face decisions that could have different implications for us and ServiceMaster. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between ServiceMaster and us regarding the terms of the agreements governing the distribution and our relationship with ServiceMaster thereafter. These agreements include the separation and distribution agreement, the tax matters agreement, the employee matters agreement, the transition services agreement, the stockholder and registration rights agreement and any commercial agreements between the parties or their affiliates. Potential conflicts of interest may also arise out of any commercial arrangements that we or ServiceMaster may enter into in the future.\n\ufeff\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could materially and adversely affect us.\n\ufeff\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act and are required to prepare our financial statements according to the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. In addition, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports. Our failure to prepare and disclose this information in a timely manner or to otherwise comply with applicable law could subject us to penalties under federal securities laws, expose us to lawsuits and restrict our ability to access financing. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that, among other things, we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and disclosure purposes. Internal control over financial reporting is complex and may be revised over time to adapt to changes in our business, or changes in applicable accounting rules. We cannot assure you that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in the future or that a material weakness will not be discovered with respect to a prior period for which we had previously believed that internal controls were effective. If we are not able to maintain or document effective internal control over financial reporting, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be able to certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. While we have been adhering to these laws and regulations as a subsidiary of ServiceMaster, we will need to demonstrate our ability to manage our compliance with these corporate governance laws and regulations as an independent, public company.\n\ufeff\nMatters affecting our internal controls may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis or may cause us to restate previously issued financial information, and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions or investigations by the SEC, or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in our Company and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements is also likely to suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm reports a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. This could have a material and adverse effect on us by, for example, leading to a decline in our share price and impairing our ability to raise additional capital.\n\ufeff\nAs an independent, publicly traded company, we may not enjoy the same benefits that we did as a segment of ServiceMaster.\n\ufeff\nPrior to the Spin-off, our business operated as one of ServiceMaster\u2019s business segments, and ServiceMaster performed or substantially oversaw all the corporate functions for our operations, including managing financial and human resources systems, internal auditing, investor relations, treasury services, accounting functions, finance and tax administration, benefits administration, legal, regulatory, and corporate branding functions. Following the Spin-off, ServiceMaster provides support to us with respect to certain of these functions on a transitional basis. We need to replicate certain facilities, systems, infrastructure and positions to which we no longer have access after the Spin-off and have been incurring, and will likely continue to incur, capital and other costs associated with developing and implementing our own support functions in these areas. Such costs could be material.\n\ufeff\nAs an independent, publicly traded company, we may become more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than we would have been were we still a part of ServiceMaster. As part of ServiceMaster, we had been able to enjoy certain benefits from ServiceMaster\u2019s operating diversity and available capital for investments. As an independent, publicly traded company, we do not have similar operating diversity and may not have similar access to capital markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nIn connection with the Spin-off, ServiceMaster will indemnify us for certain liabilities and we will indemnify ServiceMaster for certain liabilities. If we are required to pay under these indemnities to ServiceMaster, our financial results could be negatively impacted. The ServiceMaster indemnity may not be sufficient to hold us harmless from the full amount of liabilities for which ServiceMaster will be allocated responsibility, and ServiceMaster may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future.\n\ufeff\nPursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and certain other agreements with ServiceMaster, ServiceMaster agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify ServiceMaster for certain liabilities, in each case for uncapped amounts. Our indemnification obligations to ServiceMaster are not subject to any cap, may be significant and could negatively impact our business, particularly with respect to indemnities provided in the tax matters agreement. See \u201c-If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could be subject to significant tax liabilities and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify ServiceMaster for material taxes and other related amounts pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement.\u201d Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that ServiceMaster has agreed to retain. Any amounts we are required to pay pursuant to these indemnification obligations and other liabilities could require us to divert cash that would otherwise have been used in furtherance of our operating business. Further, the indemnity from ServiceMaster may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, and ServiceMaster may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from ServiceMaster any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. Each of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\ufeff\nThe trading market for our common stock has existed for only a short period following the Spin-off, and the market price and trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\n\ufeff\nPrior to the Spin-off, there was no public market for our common stock. An active trading market for our common stock commenced only recently following the Spin-off and may not be sustainable. The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. If the per share trading price of our common stock declines significantly, you may be unable to resell your shares at or above the purchase price.\n\ufeff\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:\n\u00b7\nindustry or general market conditions;\n\u00b7\ndomestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u00b7\nlawsuits, enforcement actions and other claims by third parties or governmental authorities;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our customers\u2019 preferences;\n\u00b7\nnew regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7\nchanges in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or lack of research coverage and reports by industry analysts;\n\u00b7\naction by institutional stockholders or other large stockholders;\n\u00b7\nfailure to meet any guidance given by us or any change in any guidance given by us, or changes by us in our guidance practices;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us of significant impairment charges;\n\u00b7\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u00b7\ninvestor perception of us and our industry;\n\u00b7\nchanges in market valuations or earnings of similar companies;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions or strategic partnerships;\n\u00b7\nwar, terrorist acts and epidemic disease;\n\u00b7\nany future sales of our common stock or other securities; and\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key personnel.\n\ufeff\nThe stock markets have experienced volatility in recent years that has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, class action litigation has often been instituted against the affected company. Any litigation of this type brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nFuture issuances of common stock by us, and the availability for resale of shares held by ServiceMaster and its affiliates, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\n\ufeff\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Substantially all of the outstanding shares of our common stock were available for resale in the public market following the Spin-off. The market price of our common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\n\ufeff\nFollowing the Spin-off, ServiceMaster retained approximately 19.8 percent of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Pursuant to a stockholder and registration rights agreement that we entered into in connection with the Spin-off, we have granted ServiceMaster \u201cdemand\u201d registration rights. We understand that ServiceMaster currently intends to dispose of all of our common stock that it retained after the Spin-off by June 14, 2019 in accordance with the terms of the IRS private letter ruling. In addition, none of the shares outstanding upon consummation of the Spin-off were \u201crestricted securities\u201d within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), and all of such shares are freely tradable subject to certain restrictions in the case of shares held by persons deemed to be our affiliates. Any disposition by ServiceMaster, or any significant stockholder, of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such disposition could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for shares of our common stock.\n\ufeff\nIn the future, we may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of our common stock in connection with a financing, acquisition, litigation settlement or employee arrangement or otherwise. Any of these issuances could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\n\ufeff\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\n\ufeff\nWe currently intend to retain future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business. As a result, we do not expect to pay any cash dividend for the foreseeable future. All decisions regarding the payment of dividends will be made by our board of directors from time to time in accordance with applicable law. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient surplus under Delaware law to be able to pay any dividends at any time in the future. An insufficient surplus may result from extraordinary cash expenses, actual expenses exceeding contemplated costs, funding of capital expenditures or increases in reserves. If we do not pay dividends, the price of the shares of our common stock must appreciate for you to receive a gain on your investment. This appreciation may not occur. Further, you may have to sell some or all of your shares of our common stock to generate cash flow from your investment.\n\ufeff\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish regular reports on us or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\n\ufeff\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts that covers our common stock downgrades our stock or publishes misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of the analysts ceases coverage of our common stock or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which could cause our common stock price or trading volume to decline.\n\ufeff\nFuture offerings of debt or equity securities which would rank senior to our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\n\ufeff\nIf, in the future, we decide to issue debt or equity securities that rank senior to our common stock, it is likely that such securities will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and may result in dilution of owners of our common stock. We and, indirectly, our stockholders, will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of their stock holdings in us.\n\ufeff\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of applicable law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our Company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\n\ufeff\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, and Delaware law, contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids more expensive to the acquiror and to encourage prospective acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings and the right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. Delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 percent or more of our outstanding common stock and us.\n\ufeff\nWe believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of our Company and our stockholders. Accordingly, in the event that our board of directors determines that a potential business combination transaction is not in the best interests of our Company and our stockholders, but certain stockholders believe that such a transaction would be beneficial to us and our stockholders, such stockholders may elect to sell their shares in our Company and the trading price of our common stock could decrease.\n\ufeff\nThese and other provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or other change in control, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, because we are regulated by state regulators in certain states, we are subject to certain state statutes that generally require any person or entity desiring to acquire direct or indirect control of certain of our subsidiaries obtain prior approval from the applicable regulator. Control is generally presumed to exist under these state laws with the acquisition of 10 percent or more of our outstanding voting securities of either the subsidiary or its controlling parent. Applicable state insurance laws and regulations could delay or impede a change of control of the Company.\n\ufeff\nFurthermore, an acquisition or further issuance of our stock could trigger the application of Section 355(e) of the Code, causing the distribution to be taxable to ServiceMaster. Under the tax matters agreement, and as described in more detail above, we would be required to indemnify ServiceMaster for the resulting taxes and related amount, and this indemnity obligation might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that you may consider favorable.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers.\n\ufeff\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless the board of directors otherwise determines, the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of our Company, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer to our Company or our stockholders, creditors or other constituents, any action asserting a claim against us or any director or officer arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us or any director or officer governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with our Company or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court outside of the State of Delaware were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\ufeff\nRisks Related to Our Substantial Indebtedness\n\ufeff\nWe have substantial indebtedness and may incur substantial additional indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to obtain financing in the future, react to changes in our business and satisfy our obligations.\n\ufeff\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $998 million of total consolidated long-term indebtedness, including the current portion of long-term debt, outstanding.\n\ufeff\nAs of December 31, 2018, there were no letters of credit outstanding, and there was $250 million of available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, we are able to incur additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you. Because of our substantial indebtedness:\n\u00b7\nour ability to engage in acquisitions without raising additional equity or obtaining additional debt financing is limited;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes and our ability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness may be impaired in the future;\n\u00b7\na large portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes;\n\u00b7\nwe are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because a portion of our borrowings are or will be at variable rates of interest;\n\u00b7\nit may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our creditors, resulting in possible defaults on, and acceleration of, such indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nwe may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nwe may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with proportionately less indebtedness or with comparable indebtedness on more favorable terms and, as a result, they may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns;\n\u00b7\nour ability to refinance indebtedness may be limited or the associated costs may increase;\n\u00b7\nour flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions and ability to withstand competitive pressures could be limited; and\n\u00b7\nwe may be prevented from carrying out capital spending and restructurings that are necessary or important to our growth strategy and efforts to improve operating margins of our business.\n\ufeff\nIncreases in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our indebtedness and could reduce our profitability.\n\ufeff\nA significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness, including indebtedness incurred under the Credit Facilities, bears interest at variable rates. As a result, increases in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our indebtedness and could materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. As of December 31, 2018, each one percentage point change in interest rates would result in an approximately $3 million change in the annual interest expense on the Term Loan Facility after considering the impact of the effective interest rate swap. Assuming all revolving loans were fully drawn as of December 31, 2018, each one percentage point change in interest rates would result in an approximately $3 million change in annual interest expense on the Revolving Credit Facility. The impact of increases in interest rates could be more significant for us than it would be for some other companies because of our substantial indebtedness. Our variable rate indebtedness uses the LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. In the event that LIBOR is phased out as is currently expected, the Credit Facilities provide that the Company and the administrative agent may amend the credit agreement to replace the LIBOR definition with a successor rate based on prevailing market convention, subject to notifying the lending syndicate of such change and not receiving within 5 business days of such notification written, good faith objections to such replacement rate from lenders holding at least a majority of the aggregate principal amount of loans and commitments then outstanding under the credit agreement. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include an increase in the interest cost of our variable rate indebtedness.\n\ufeff\nA lowering or withdrawal of the ratings, outlook or watch assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital.\n\ufeff\nOur indebtedness currently has a non-investment grade rating, and any rating, outlook or watch assigned could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, current or future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, outlook or watch, such as adverse changes to our business, so warrant. Any future lowering of our ratings, outlook or watch likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing.\n\ufeff\nThe agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business.\n\ufeff\nThe credit agreement governing our Credit Facilities and the indenture governing our senior notes contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:\n\u00b7\nincur additional indebtedness (including guarantees of other indebtedness);\n\u00b7\nreceive dividends from certain of our subsidiaries, redeem stock or make other restricted payments, including investments and, in the case of the Revolving Credit Facility, make acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nprepay, repurchase or amend the terms of certain outstanding indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nenter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n\u00b7\ntransfer or sell assets;\n\u00b7\ncreate liens;\n\u00b7\nmerge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u00b7\nenter into agreements restricting dividends or other distributions by our subsidiaries.\n\ufeff\nThe restrictions in the agreements governing the Credit Facilities and the instruments governing our other indebtedness may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility. We may be unable to refinance our indebtedness, at maturity or otherwise, on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\n\ufeff\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the agreements governing the Credit Facilities and the instruments governing our other indebtedness may be affected by economic, financial and industry conditions beyond our control including credit or capital market disruptions. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default that would permit the applicable lenders to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If we are unable to repay indebtedness, lenders having secured obligations, such as the lenders under the Credit Facilities, could proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness. In any such case, we may be unable to borrow under the Credit Facilities and may not be able to repay the amounts due under such facilities or our other outstanding indebtedness. This could have serious consequences for our financial position and results of operations and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent.\n\ufeff\nOur ability to generate the significant amount of cash needed to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness and our ability to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing depends on many factors beyond our control.\n\ufeff\nWe are a holding company, and substantially all of our assets are held by, and our operations are conducted through, our subsidiaries. We depend on our subsidiaries to distribute funds to us so that we may pay obligations and expenses, including satisfying obligations with respect to indebtedness. Our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance our obligations under, our indebtedness depends on the financial and operating performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to make distributions and dividends to us, which, in turn, depends on their operating results, cash requirements, financial position and general business conditions and any legal and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends to which they may be subject, many of which may be beyond our control.\n\ufeff\nThere are third-party restrictions on the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. These restrictions are related to regulatory requirements. The payments of ordinary and extraordinary dividends by certain of our subsidiaries (through which we conduct our business) are subject to significant regulatory restrictions under the laws and regulations of the states in which they operate. Among other things, such laws and regulations require certain subsidiaries to maintain minimum capital and net worth requirements and may limit the amount of ordinary and extraordinary dividends and other payments that these subsidiaries can pay to us. As of December 31, 2018, the total net assets subject to these third-party restrictions was $187 million. We expect that such limitations will be in effect for the foreseeable future. In Texas, we are relieved of the obligation to post 75 percent of our otherwise required reserves because we operate a captive insurer approved by Texas regulators in order to satisfy such obligations. None of our subsidiaries are obligated to make funds available to us through the payment of dividends. If we cannot receive sufficient distributions from our subsidiaries, we may not be able to meet our obligations to fund general corporate expenses or service our debt obligations.\n\ufeff\nWe may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek to obtain additional equity capital or restructure our indebtedness. In the future, our cash flow and capital resources may not be sufficient for payments of interest on and principal of our indebtedness, and such alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.\n\ufeff\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, we will be in default, the lenders under the Credit Facilities could terminate their commitments to loan money, the secured lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\n\ufeff\nDespite our indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\n\ufeff\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of the instruments governing our indebtedness do not prohibit us or fully prohibit our subsidiaries from doing so. The Credit Facilities permit additional borrowings beyond the committed amounts under certain circumstances. If new indebtedness is added to our current indebtedness levels, the related risks we face would increase, and we may not be able to meet all of our debt obligations.\n\ufeff\nWe utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates on our variable-rate indebtedness and are exposed to risks related to counterparty credit worthiness or non-performance of these instruments.\n\ufeff\nWe are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and manage this exposure through the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps. On October 24, 2018, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement effective October 31, 2018 that expires on August 16, 2025. The notional amount of the agreement was $350 million. We entered into this interest rate swap agreement in the normal course of business to manage interest rate risks, with a policy of matching positions. The effect of derivative financial instrument transactions under the agreements could have a material impact on our financial statements. There can be no guarantee that our hedging strategy will be effective, and we may experience credit-related losses in some circumstances.\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 18064, "SIC": 1520, "TIC": "FTDR"}
