Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThere are numerous factors that affect our business and operating results, many of which are beyond our control. The following is a description of significant factors that might cause our future operating results to differ materially from those currently expected. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not specified herein, not currently known to us or currently deemed to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial position, operating results and/or cash flows.\nThe success of our business largely depends on the level of activity in the oil and gas industry, which can be significantly affected by volatile oil and natural gas prices.\nThe success of our business largely depends on the level of activity in offshore oil and natural gas exploration, development and production. Oil and natural gas prices, and market expectations of potential changes in these prices, significantly affect the level of drilling activity. Historically, when drilling activity and operator capital spending decline, utilization and day rates also decline and drilling may be reduced or discontinued, resulting in an oversupply of drilling rigs. The oversupply of drilling rigs will be exacerbated by the entry of newbuild rigs into the market. Oil prices have declined by more than 70% since mid-2014, with crude oil prices trading below $30 per barrel in January 2016, in contrast to prices in excess of $100 per barrel in July 2014. The decline in oil prices has in turn caused a significant decline in the demand for offshore drilling services. Operators have reduced capital spending and cancelled or deferred existing programs. We expect these trends to continue as long as commodity prices remain at current levels. A sustained period of lower prices, or the perceived risk of a sustained period of lower prices, may further reduce our customers' overall level of activity, in which case demand for our services may further decline and revenues may continue to be adversely affected through lower rig utilization and/or lower day rates. Numerous factors may affect oil and natural gas prices and the level of demand for our services, including:\n\u2022\nregional and global economic conditions and changes therein,\n\u2022\noil and natural gas supply and demand,\n\u2022\nexpectations regarding future energy prices,\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\"OPEC\") to set and maintain production levels and pricing,\n\u2022\ncapital allocation decisions by our customers, including the relative economics of offshore development versus onshore prospects,\n\u2022\nthe level of production by non-OPEC countries,\n\u2022\nU.S. and non-U.S. tax policy,\n\u2022\nadvances in exploration and development technology,\n\u2022\ncosts associated with exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas,\n\u2022\nrate of discovery of new oil and gas reserves and the rate of decline of existing oil and gas reserves,\n\u2022\nlaws and government regulations that limit, restrict or prohibit exploration and development of oil and natural gas in various jurisdictions, or materially increase the cost of such exploration and development,\n\u2022\nthe development and exploitation of alternative fuels,\n\u2022\ndisruption to exploration and development activities due to hurricanes and other severe weather conditions and the risk thereof,\n\u2022\nnatural disasters or incidents resulting from operating hazards inherent in offshore drilling, such as oil spills, and\n\u2022\nthe worldwide military or political environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities or other crises in oil or natural gas producing areas of the Middle East or geographic areas in which we operate, or acts of terrorism.\nThe level of offshore exploration, development and production activity and the price for oil and natural gas is volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Any prolonged decline in oil and natural gas prices will depress the levels of exploration, development and production activity. Despite significant recent declines in capital spending and cancelled or deferred drilling programs by many operators, oil and gas production has not yet been reduced by amounts sufficient to result in a rebound in pricing, and we may not see sufficient supply reductions or a resulting rebound in pricing for an extended period of time. Certain OPEC countries have reached tentative agreements to freeze production and have indicated that discussions are ongoing regarding production cuts. However, such agreements have not been agreed to by all member countries, and OPEC countries may never come to an agreement on production cuts. The lack of production cuts by OPEC countries, or the perceived risk that OPEC countries are unable to come to an agreement on production cuts or that OPEC countries may not comply with any such agreement, may result in lower commodity prices for an extended period of time.\nIn addition, continued hostility in foreign countries and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks against the United States or other countries could create downward pressure on the economies of the United States and other countries. Moreover, higher commodity prices may not necessarily translate into increased activity, and even during periods of high commodity prices, customers may cancel or curtail their drilling programs, or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons, including their lack of success in exploration efforts. Advances in onshore exploration and development technologies, particularly with respect to onshore shale plays, could also result in our customers allocating more of their capital expenditure budgets to onshore exploration and production activities and less to offshore activities. These factors could cause our revenues and profits to decline, as a result of declines in utilization and day rates, and limit our future growth prospects. Any significant decline in day rates or utilization of our rigs, particularly our high-specification floaters, could materially reduce our revenues and profitability. In addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and obtain insurance coverage that we consider adequate or are otherwise required by our contracts.\nThe offshore contract drilling industry historically has been highly competitive and cyclical, with periods of low demand and excess rig availability that could result in adverse effects on our business.\nOur industry is highly competitive, and our contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Pricing, safety records and competency are key factors in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job. Rig availability, location and technical capabilities also can be significant factors in the determination. In addition, consolidations within the oil and gas industry have reduced the number of available customers, resulting in increased competition for projects. If we are not able to compete successfully, our revenues and profitability may be reduced.\nFinancial operating results in the offshore contract drilling industry historically have been very cyclical and are primarily related to the demand for drilling rigs and the available supply of drilling rigs. Demand for rigs is directly related to the regional and worldwide levels of offshore exploration and development spending by oil and gas companies, which is beyond our control. Offshore exploration and development spending may fluctuate substantially from year-to-year and from region-to-region.\nThe supply of offshore drilling rigs has increased in recent years. Currently, there are approximately 180 newbuild drillships, semisubmersibles and jackup rigs reported to be on order or under construction with delivery expected by the end of 2020. Approximately 105 of these rigs are scheduled for delivery during 2016, representing an approximate 13% increase in the total worldwide fleet of offshore drilling rigs since year end 2015. Many of these offshore drilling rigs do not have drilling contracts in place. In addition, the supply of marketed offshore drilling rigs could further increase due to depressed market conditions resulting in currently contracted rigs being uncontracted as existing contracts expire. There are no assurances that the market in general or a geographic region in particular will be able to fully absorb the supply of new rigs in future periods.\nThe increase in supply of offshore drilling rigs in recent years has resulted in an oversupply of offshore drilling rigs and a decline in utilization and/or day rates, a situation which, if it persists for the next few years, could be exacerbated by a prolonged decline in demand for drilling rigs. Lower utilization and/or day rates in one or more of the regions in which we operate could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nFuture periods of reduced demand and/or excess rig supply may require us to idle additional rigs or enter into lower day rate contracts or contracts with less favorable terms. There can be no assurance that the current demand for drilling rigs will increase in the future. Any further decline in demand for drilling rigs or a continued oversupply of drilling rigs could adversely affect our financial position, operating results and cash flows.\nOur business will be adversely affected if we are unable to secure contracts on economically favorable terms.\nOur ability to renew expiring contracts or obtain new contracts and the terms of any such contracts will depend on market conditions. We may be unable to renew our expiring contracts or obtain new contracts for the rigs under contracts that have expired or been terminated, and the day rates under any new contracts or any renegotiated contracts may be substantially below the existing day rates, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nNone of our four rigs currently under construction, which are scheduled for delivery from 2016 to 2018, have a customer contract. There is no assurance that we will secure drilling contracts for these rigs, or future rigs we construct, or that the drilling contracts we may be able to secure will be based upon rates and terms that will provide a reasonable rate of return on these investments. Our failure to secure contractual commitments for these rigs at rates and terms that result in a reasonable return upon completion of construction may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results and cash flows.\nOur customers may be unable or unwilling to fulfill their contractual commitments to us, including their obligations to pay for losses, damages or other liabilities resulting from operations under the contract.\nCertain of our customers are subject to liquidity risk and such risk could lead them to seek to repudiate, cancel or renegotiate our drilling contracts for various reasons or fail to fulfill their commitments to us under those contracts. These risks are heightened in periods of depressed market conditions. Our drilling contracts provide for varying levels\nof indemnification from our customers, including with respect to well control and subsurface risks. Our drilling contracts also provide for varying levels of indemnification and allocation of liabilities between our customers and us with respect to loss or damage to property and injury or death to persons arising from the drilling operations we perform. Under our drilling contracts, liability with respect to personnel and property customarily is generally allocated so that we and our customers each assume liability for our respective personnel and property. Our customers typically assume most of the responsibility for and indemnify us from any loss, damage or other liability resulting from pollution or contamination, including clean-up and removal, third-party damages, and fines and penalties arising from operations under the contract when the source of the pollution originates from the well or reservoir, including those resulting from blow-outs or cratering of the well. Notwithstanding a contractual indemnity from a customer, there can be no assurance that our customers will be financially able to assume their responsibility, or honor their indemnity to us, for such losses. In addition, under the laws of certain jurisdictions, such indemnities are not enforceable if the cause of the damage was our gross negligence or willful misconduct. This could result in our having to assume liabilities not otherwise contemplated in our contracts due to customer balance sheet or liquidity issues or applicable law.\nWe may suffer losses if our customers terminate or seek to renegotiate our contracts, if operations are suspended or interrupted or if a rig becomes a total loss.\nIn periods of rapid market downturn similar to the current environment, our customers may not be able to honor the terms of existing contracts (including contracts for new rigs under construction), may terminate contracts even where there may be onerous termination fees, may seek to void or otherwise repudiate our contracts including by claiming we have breached the contract, or may seek to renegotiate contract day rates and terms in light of depressed market conditions. Generally our drilling contracts are subject to termination without cause upon notice by the customer. Although our contracts may require the customer to pay an early termination payment in the event of a termination for convenience (without cause), such payment may not fully compensate us for the lost revenue from the contract, and some of our contracts permit termination by the customer without an early termination payment.\nFor example, we received notice of termination for convenience for ENSCO DS-4 in March 2015 and for ENSCO DS-9 in July 2015, each of which were accompanied by early termination fees that were less than what we would have received over the term of each contract absent termination.\nWe received a notice in January 2016 from Petrobras asserting that the ENSCO DS-5 drilling services contract is void. We disagree with Petrobras\u2019 assertion that the ENSCO DS-5 drilling services contract is void and plan to pursue our legal rights in connection with this dispute. However, there can be no assurance as to how this dispute will ultimately be resolved. We did not recognize $44.7 million of revenue for ENSCO DS-5 drilling services provided during the fourth quarter of 2015 as we concluded collectability of these amounts was not reasonably assured. Additionally, we recorded a $17.1 million provision for doubtful accounts during the year ended December 31, 2015 for receivables related to ENSCO DS-5 drilling services provided through September 30, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, our receivables from Petrobras related to the ENSCO DS-5 contract were fully reserved on our consolidated balance sheet. See \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings - DSA Dispute\" for further information.\nOur drilling services contracts with Petrobras for ENSCO 6001, 6002, 6003 and 6004 continue to be in full force and effect and all payments under these contracts are current. We note, however, that under the ENSCO 6001 drilling services contract we are nearing the limit for rig downtime that would permit the customer to terminate the contract without compensation. While we have not yet received a notice of termination from the customer for this contract, Petrobras is taking the position that the limit has been exceeded. We are in the process of contesting Petrobras\u2019 position with respect to rig downtime.\nDrilling contracts customarily specify automatic termination or termination at the option of the customer in the event of a total loss of the drilling rig and often include provisions addressing termination rights or reduction or cessation of day rates if operations are suspended or interrupted for extended periods due to breakdown of major rig equipment, unsatisfactory performance, \"force majeure\" events beyond the control of either party or other specified conditions.\nIf a customer cancels a contract or if we terminate a contract due to the customer\u2019s breach and, in either case, we are unable to secure a new contract on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms, or if a contract is disputed or suspended for an extended period of time or renegotiated, it could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may incur impairments as a result of future declines in demand for offshore drilling rigs.\nWe evaluate the carrying value of our property and equipment, primarily our drilling rigs, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such rigs may not be recoverable. The offshore drilling industry historically has been highly cyclical, and it is not unusual for rigs to be idle or underutilized for significant periods of time and subsequently resume full or near full utilization when business cycles change. Likewise, during periods in which rig supply exceeds rig demand, competition may force us to contract our rigs at or near cash break-even rates for extended periods of time.\nSince January 1, 2014, we have recorded pre-tax, non-cash losses on impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill of $5.1 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. Further asset impairments may be necessary if market conditions remain depressed for longer than we expect. There is no remaining goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.\nWe may reduce or suspend our dividend in the future.\nOur Board of Directors declared a $0.01 quarterly cash dividend per Class A ordinary share for the first quarter of 2016, a $0.14 reduction from the $0.15 dividend per share paid for each of the four fiscal quarters in 2015. In the future, our Board of Directors may, without advance notice, further reduce or suspend our dividend in order to improve our financial flexibility and best position our company for long-term success. The declaration and amount of future dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our profitability, liquidity, financial condition, market outlook, reinvestment opportunities, capital requirements and other factors and restrictions our Board of Directors deems relevant. There can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future.\nThe loss of a significant customer could adversely affect us.\nWe provide our services to major international, government-owned and independent oil and gas companies. During 2015, our five largest customers accounted for 52% of our consolidated revenues in the aggregate, with our largest customer representing 18% of our consolidated revenues. Our financial position, operating results and cash flows may be materially adversely affected if a major customer terminates its contracts with us, fails to renew its existing contracts with us, requires renegotiation of our contracts or declines to award new contracts to us.\nOur current backlog of contract drilling revenue may not be fully realized and may decline significantly in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our contract backlog was approximately $5.8 billion, which represents a decline of $3.9 billion since December 31, 2014. This amount reflects the remaining contractual terms multiplied by the applicable contractual day rate, excluding $79 million in backlog attributable to the ENSCO DS-5 contract that Petrobras has asserted is void. See \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings - DSA Dispute\" for further information. The contractual revenue may be higher than the actual revenue we receive because of a number of factors, including rig downtime or suspension of operations. Several factors could cause rig downtime or a suspension of operations, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe early termination, repudiation or renegotiation of contracts,\n\u2022\nbreakdowns of equipment,\n\u2022\nwork stoppages, including labor strikes,\n\u2022\nshortages of material and skilled labor,\n\u2022\nsurveys by government and maritime authorities,\n\u2022\nperiodic classification surveys,\n\u2022\nsevere weather, strong ocean currents or harsh operating conditions,\n\u2022\nthe occurrence or threat of epidemic or pandemic diseases or any government response to such occurrence or threat, and\n\u2022\nforce majeure events.\nOur customers may seek to terminate, repudiate or renegotiate our drilling contracts for various reasons. Generally our drilling contracts permit early termination of the contract by the customer for convenience (without cause), exercisable upon advance notice to us, and in some cases without making an early termination payment to us. There can be no assurances that our customers will be able to or willing to fulfill their contractual commitments to us.\nThe recent decline in oil prices, the perceived risk of a further decline in oil prices, and the resulting downward pressure on utilization has caused and may continue to cause some customers to consider early termination of select contracts despite having to pay onerous early termination fees in some cases. Customers may request to re-negotiate the terms of existing contracts, or they may request early termination or seek to repudiate contracts in some circumstances. Furthermore, as our existing contracts roll off, we may be unable to secure replacement contracts for our rigs. Therefore, revenues recorded in future periods could differ materially from our current backlog. Our inability to realize the full amount of our contract backlog may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may have difficulty obtaining or maintaining insurance in the future on terms we find acceptable and our insurance coverage may not protect us against all of the risks and hazards we face, including those specific to offshore operations.\nOur operations are subject to hazards inherent in the offshore drilling industry, such as blow-outs, reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well control, uncontrolled formation pressures, lost or stuck drill strings, equipment failures and mechanical breakdowns, punchthroughs, craterings, industrial accidents, fires, explosions, oil spills and pollution. These hazards can cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, which could lead to claims by third parties or customers, suspension of operations and contract terminations. Our fleet is also subject to hazards inherent in marine operations, either while on-site or during mobilization, such as capsizing, sinking, grounding, collision, damage from severe weather and marine life infestations. Additionally, a security breach of our information systems or other technological failure could lead to a material disruption of our operations, information systems, and/or loss of business information, which could result in an adverse impact to our business. Our drilling contracts provide for varying levels of indemnification from our customers, including with respect to well control and subsurface risks. We also maintain insurance for personal injuries, damage to or loss of equipment and other insurance coverage for various business risks.\nWe generally identify the operational hazards for which we will procure insurance coverage based on the likelihood of loss, the potential magnitude of loss, the cost of coverage, the requirements of our customer contracts and applicable legal requirements. Although we maintain what we believe to be an appropriate level of insurance covering hazards and risks we currently encounter during our operations, no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain insurance against all potential risks and hazards.\nFurthermore, our insurance carriers may interpret our insurance policies such that they do not cover losses for which we make claims. Our insurance policies may also have exclusions of coverage for some losses. Uninsured\nexposures may include radiation hazards, certain loss or damage to property onboard our rigs and losses relating to shore-based terrorist acts or strikes.\nIf we are unable to obtain or maintain adequate insurance at rates and with deductibles or retention amounts that we consider commercially reasonable, we may choose to forgo insurance coverage and retain the associated risk of loss or damage.\nIf a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or contractual indemnity (or if our contractual indemnity is not enforceable under applicable law), it could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe potential for U.S. Gulf of Mexico hurricane related windstorm damage or liabilities could result in uninsured losses and may cause us to alter our operating procedures during hurricane season, which could adversely affect our business.\nCertain areas in and near the U.S. Gulf of Mexico experience hurricanes and other extreme weather conditions on a relatively frequent basis. Some of our drilling rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico are located in areas that could cause them to be susceptible to damage and/or total loss by these storms, and we have a larger concentration of jackup rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico than most of our competitors. We currently have eight jackup rigs and nine floaters in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Damage caused by high winds and turbulent seas could result in rig loss or damage, termination of drilling contracts for lost or severely damaged rigs or curtailment of operations on damaged drilling rigs with reduced or suspended day rates for significant periods of time until the damage can be repaired. Moreover, even if our drilling rigs are not directly damaged by such storms, we may experience disruptions in our operations due to damage to our customers' platforms and other related facilities in the area. Our drilling operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico have been impacted by hurricanes, including the total loss of one jackup rig during 2004, one platform rig during 2005 and two jackup rigs during 2008, with associated losses of contract revenues and potential liabilities.\nInsurance companies incurred substantial losses in the offshore drilling, exploration and production industries as a consequence of hurricanes that occurred in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico during 2004, 2005 and 2008. Accordingly, insurance companies have substantially reduced the nature and amount of insurance coverage available for losses arising from named tropical storm or hurricane damage in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (\"windstorm damage\") and have dramatically increased the cost of available windstorm coverage. The tight insurance market not only applies to coverage related to U.S. Gulf of Mexico windstorm damage or loss of our drilling rigs, but also impacts coverage for any potential liabilities to third parties associated with property damage, personal injury or death and environmental liabilities, as well as coverage for removal of wreckage and debris associated with hurricane losses. We have no assurance that the tight insurance market for windstorm damage, liabilities and removal of wreckage and debris will not continue into the foreseeable future.\nWe decided not to purchase windstorm insurance for hull and machinery losses to our floaters arising from windstorm damage in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico since the renewal of our annual insurance policies in May 2014, due to the significant premium, high deductible and limited coverage for windstorm damage. We opted out of windstorm insurance for our jackups in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico during 2009 and have not since renewed that insurance. We believe it is no longer customary for drilling contractors with similar size and fleet composition to purchase windstorm insurance for rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, for the aforementioned reasons. Accordingly, we have retained the risk of loss or damage for our eight jackup rigs and our nine floaters arising from windstorm damage in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.\nWe have established operational procedures designed to mitigate risk to our jackup rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico during hurricane season. In addition to procedures designed to better secure the drilling package on jackup rigs, improve jackup leg stability and increase the air gap to position the hull above waves, our procedures involve analysis of prospective drilling locations, which may include enhanced bottom surveys. These procedures may result in a decision to decline to operate on a customer-designated location during hurricane season notwithstanding that the location, water depth and other standard operating conditions are within a rig's normal operating range. Our procedures\nand the associated regulatory requirements addressing Mobile Offshore Drilling Unit operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico during hurricane season, coupled with our decision to retain (self-insure) certain windstorm-related risks, may result in a significant reduction in the utilization of our jackup rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.\nOur annual insurance policies are up for renewal effective May 31, 2016, and any retained exposures for property loss or damage and wreckage and debris removal or other liabilities associated with U.S. Gulf of Mexico tropical storms or hurricanes may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results and cash flows if we sustain significant uninsured or underinsured losses or liabilities as a result of U.S. Gulf of Mexico tropical storms or hurricanes.\nOur non-U.S. operations involve additional risks not typically associated with U.S. operations.\nRevenues from non-U.S. operations were 72%, 62% and 61% of our total revenues during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our non-U.S. operations and shipyard rig construction and enhancement projects are subject to political, economic and other uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\nterrorist acts, war and civil disturbances,\n\u2022\nexpropriation, nationalization, deprivation or confiscation of our equipment,\n\u2022\nexpropriation or nationalization of a customer's property or drilling rights,\n\u2022\nrepudiation or nationalization of contracts,\n\u2022\nassaults on property or personnel,\n\u2022\npiracy, kidnapping and extortion demands,\n\u2022\nsignificant governmental influence over many aspects of local economies and customers,\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in law and regulatory requirements, including changes in interpretation or enforcement of existing laws,\n\u2022\nwork stoppages, often due to strikes over which we have little or no control,\n\u2022\ncomplications associated with repairing and replacing equipment in remote locations,\n\u2022\nlimitations on insurance coverage, such as war risk coverage, in certain areas,\n\u2022\nimposition of trade barriers,\n\u2022\nwage and price controls,\n\u2022\nimport-export quotas,\n\u2022\nexchange restrictions,\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations,\n\u2022\nchanges in monetary policies,\n\u2022\nuncertainty or instability resulting from hostilities or other crises in the Middle East, West Africa, Latin America or other geographic areas in which we operate,\n\u2022\nchanges in the manner or rate of taxation,\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to recover amounts due,\n\u2022\nincreased risk of government and vendor/supplier corruption,\n\u2022\nincreased local content requirements,\n\u2022\nthe occurrence or threat of epidemic or pandemic diseases or any government response to such occurrence or threat,\n\u2022\nchanges in political conditions, and\n\u2022\nother forms of government regulation and economic conditions that are beyond our control.\nWe historically have maintained insurance coverage and obtained contractual indemnities that protect us from some, but not all, of the risks associated with our non-U.S. operations such as nationalization, deprivation, expropriation, confiscation, political and war risks. However, there can be no assurance that any particular type of contractual or insurance protection will be available in the future or that we will be able to purchase our desired level of insurance coverage at commercially feasible rates. Moreover, we may initiate a self-insurance program through one or more captive insurance subsidiaries. In circumstances where we have insurance protection for some or all of the risks sometimes associated with non-U.S. operations, such insurance may be subject to cancellation on short notice, and it is unlikely that we would be able to remove our rig or rigs from the affected area within the notice period. Accordingly, a significant event for which we are uninsured, underinsured or self-insured, or for which we have not received an enforceable contractual indemnity from a customer, could cause a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results and cash flows.\nWe are subject to various tax laws and regulations in substantially all countries in which we operate or have a legal presence. We evaluate applicable tax laws and employ various business structures and operating strategies to obtain the optimal level of taxation on our revenues, income, assets and personnel. Actions by tax authorities that impact our business structures and operating strategies, such as changes to tax treaties, laws and regulations, or the interpretation or repeal of any of the foregoing or changes in the administrative practices and precedents of tax authorities, adverse rulings in connection with audits or otherwise, or other challenges may substantially increase our tax expense.\nAs required by law, we file periodic tax returns that are subject to review and examination by various revenue agencies within the jurisdictions in which we operate. We cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of existing or future tax assessments.\nOur non-U.S. operations also face the risk of fluctuating currency values, which may impact our revenues, operating costs and capital expenditures. We currently conduct contract drilling operations in certain countries that have experienced substantial fluctuations in the value of their currency compared to the U.S. dollar. In addition, some of the countries in which we operate have occasionally enacted exchange controls. Generally, we have contractually mitigated these risks by invoicing and receiving payment in U.S. dollars (our functional currency) or freely convertible currency and, to the extent possible, by limiting our acceptance of foreign currency to amounts which approximate our expenditure requirements in such currencies. However, not all of our contracts contain these terms and there is no assurance that our contracts will contain such terms in the future.\nA portion of the costs and expenditures incurred by our non-U.S. operations, including a portion of the construction payments for new rigs, are settled in local currencies, exposing us to risks associated with fluctuation in the value of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. We use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce this exposure in certain cases. However, a relative weakening in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the local currencies in these countries may increase our costs and expenditures.\nOur non-U.S. operations are also subject to various laws and regulations in countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to the operation of drilling rigs and the requirements for equipment. We may be required to make significant capital expenditures to operate in such countries, which may not be reimbursed by our customers. Governments in some countries have become increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of oil, natural gas and mineral concessions and companies holding concessions, the exploration of oil and natural gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industry in their countries. In some areas of the world, government activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and development work performed by major international oil companies and may continue to do so. Moreover, certain countries accord preferential treatment to local contractors or joint ventures or impose specific quotas for local goods and services, which can increase our operational costs and place us at a competitive disadvantage. There can be no assurance that such laws and regulations or activities will not have a material adverse effect on our future operations.\nThe shipment of goods, services and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations. Our import activities are governed by specific customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate. Moreover, many countries, including the United States, control the export and re-export of certain goods, services and technology and impose related export recordkeeping and reporting obligations. Governments also may impose express or de facto economic sanctions against certain countries, persons and other entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons and entities.\nThe laws and regulations concerning import activity, export recordkeeping and reporting, export control and economic sanctions are complex and constantly changing. These laws and regulations may be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a manner materially impacting our operations. Shipments can be delayed and denied export or entry for a variety of reasons, some of which are outside our control and some of which may result from failure to comply with existing legal and regulatory regimes. Shipping delays or denials could cause unscheduled operational downtime. Any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory trading obligations also could result in criminal and civil penalties and sanctions, such as fines, imprisonment, exclusion from government contracts, seizure of shipments and loss of import and export privileges.\nOur employees, contractors and agents may take actions in violation of our policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results or cash flows.\nRig construction, upgrade and enhancement projects are subject to risks, including delays and cost overruns, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe currently have one ultra-deepwater drillship and three jackup rigs under construction. In addition, we may construct additional rigs and continue to upgrade the capability and extend the service lives of our existing rigs. As a result of current market conditions, we may seek to delay delivery of our rigs under construction. In July 2015, we agreed with the shipyard to delay the delivery of ENSCO DS-10, our only remaining floater under construction, until the first quarter of 2017. We also recently agreed with the shipyard to delay delivery of ENSCO 123 until the first quarter of 2018. Other delays may impact the delivery of our drilling rigs under construction or undergoing upgrade or maintenance. As of December 31, 2015, there were approximately 180 new offshore drilling rigs reported to be on order or under construction with delivery expected by the end of 2020. As a result, shipyards and third-party equipment vendors are under significant resource constraints to meet delivery obligations. Such constraints may lead to substantial delivery and commissioning delays and/or equipment failures and/or quality deficiencies. Furthermore, new drilling rigs may face start-up or other operational complications following completion of construction, upgrades or maintenance. Other unexpected difficulties, including equipment failures, design or engineering problems, could result in significant downtime at reduced or zero day rates or the cancellation or termination of drilling contracts.\nRig construction, upgrade, life extension and repair projects are subject to the risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project, including the following:\n\u2022\nfailure of third-party equipment to meet quality and/or performance standards,\n\u2022\ndelays in equipment deliveries or shipyard construction,\n\u2022\nshortages of materials or skilled labor,\n\u2022\ndamage to shipyard facilities or construction work in progress, including damage resulting from fire, explosion, flooding, severe weather, terrorism, war or other armed hostilities,\n\u2022\nunforeseen design or engineering problems, including those relating to the commissioning of newly designed equipment,\n\u2022\nunanticipated actual or purported change orders,\n\u2022\nstrikes, labor disputes or work stoppages,\n\u2022\nfinancial or operating difficulties of equipment vendors or the shipyard while constructing, enhancing, upgrading, improving or repairing a rig or rigs,\n\u2022\nunanticipated cost increases,\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations impacting overall cost,\n\u2022\ninability to obtain the requisite permits or approvals,\n\u2022\nclient acceptance delays,\n\u2022\ndisputes with shipyards and suppliers,\n\u2022\nlatent damages or deterioration to hull, equipment and machinery in excess of engineering estimates and assumptions,\n\u2022\nclaims of force majeure events, and\n\u2022\nadditional risks inherent to shipyard projects in a non-U.S. location.\nWith respect to our rigs under construction, if we were to secure contracts for such rigs, we would be subject to the risk of delays and other hazards impacting the viability of such contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results and cash flows.\nOur drilling contracts with national oil companies may expose us to greater risks than we normally assume in drilling contracts with non-governmental customers.\nWe currently own and operate 11 rigs that are contracted with national oil companies. We also manage a rig for a national oil company. The terms of these contracts are often non-negotiable and may expose us to greater commercial, political and operational risks than we assume in other contracts, such as exposure to materially greater environmental liability and other claims for damages (including consequential damages) and personal injury related to our operations, or the risk that the contract may be terminated by our customer without cause on short-term notice, contractually or by governmental action, under certain conditions that may not provide us with an early termination payment. We can provide no assurance that the increased risk exposure will not have an adverse impact on our future operations or that we will not increase the number of rigs contracted to national oil companies with commensurate additional contractual risks.\nLegal and regulatory proceedings could affect us adversely.\nWe are involved in litigation, including various claims, disputes and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, many of which are uninsured and relate to intellectual property, commercial, operational, employment, regulatory, or other activities.\nWe operate in a number of countries throughout the world, including countries known to have a reputation for corruption and are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\") regulations, the U.K. Bribery Act (\"UKBA\"), other U.S. laws and regulations governing our international operations and similar laws in other countries.\nIn 2010, Pride and its subsidiaries resolved with the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and the SEC their previously disclosed investigations into potential violations of the FCPA. However, Pride received preliminary inquiries from governmental authorities of certain of the countries referenced in its settlements with the DOJ and SEC. We could face additional fines, sanctions and other penalties from authorities in these and other relevant jurisdictions, including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of our rigs or other assets. At this stage of such inquiries, we are unable to determine what, if any, legal liability may result. Our customers in those jurisdictions could seek to impose penalties or take other actions adverse to our interests. We could also face other third-party claims by directors, officers, employees, affiliates, advisors, attorneys, agents, stockholders, debt holders, or other interest holders or constituents of our Company. In addition, disclosure of the subject matter of the investigations and settlements could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain new business or retain existing business from our current clients and potential clients, to attract and retain employees and to access the capital markets.\nIn 2015, we became aware of an internal audit report by Petrobras alleging irregularities in relation to a drilling services agreement Pride entered into for ENSCO DS-5. On January 4, 2016, we received a notice from Petrobras declaring the DS-5 drilling services contract between Petrobras and Ensco void effective immediately. Petrobras\u2019 notice alleges that Samsung Heavy Industries made improper payments to our former marketing consultant who then shared the improper payments with employees of Petrobras and, without specifying any supporting facts or conduct, that Pride had knowledge of this activity and assisted in the procurement of and/or facilitated these improper payments. Our Audit Committee appointed independent counsel to lead an investigation into the alleged irregularities. See \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings - Brazil Internal Investigation\" and \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings - DSA Dispute\" for further information on the investigation. Outside of Petrobras\u2019 allegations, we have not been contacted by any Brazil governmental authority regarding alleged wrongdoing by Pride or Ensco or any of their current or former employees. We cannot predict whether any U.S., Brazilian or other governmental authority will seek to investigate this matter, or if a proceeding were opened, the scope or ultimate outcome of any such investigation.\nAny violation of the FCPA, OFAC regulations, the UKBA or other applicable anti-corruption laws, by us, our affiliated entities or their respective officers, directors, employees and agents could in some cases provide a customer with termination rights under a contract and result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or the availability of funds under our revolving credit facility. Further, we may incur significant costs and consume significant internal resources in our efforts to detect, investigate and resolve actual or alleged violations.\nIncreasing regulatory complexity could adversely impact the costs associated with our offshore drilling operations.\nIncreases in regulatory requirements, particularly in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, could significantly increase our costs. In recent years, we have seen several significant regulatory changes that have affected the way we operate in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.\nHurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 and Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008 caused damage to a number of rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. Rigs that were moved off location by the storms damaged platforms, pipelines, wellheads and other drilling rigs. The U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (\"BOEMRE\"), and one of its successor agencies, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (\"BSEE\"), have issued\nguidelines for jackup rig fitness requirements during hurricane seasons, which have been in effect since November 2014. As a result of these guidelines, jackup rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico are required to operate with a higher air gap (the space between the water level and the bottom of the rig's hull) during hurricane season, effectively reducing the water depth in which they can operate. The guidelines also provide for enhanced information and data requirements from oil and gas companies operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.\nFollowing the Macondo well incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. Department of the Interior issued Notices to Lessees (\u201cNTLs\"), implementing new requirements and/or guidelines that are applicable to drilling operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Current or future NTLs or other rules, directives and regulations may further impact our customers' ability to obtain permits and commence or continue deep or shallow water operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Future legislative or regulatory enactments may impose new requirements for well control and blowout prevention equipment that could increase our costs and cause delays in our operations due to unavailability of associated equipment.\nAlso as a result of the Macondo well incident, BOEMRE and BSEE have promulgated regulations regarding safety and environmental management systems (\"SEMS\"). During 2013, BSEE adopted a final rule modifying the SEMS requirements. Although directed primarily at operators, the SEMS requirements indirectly affect drilling contractors by imposing requirements for personnel training, written safe work practices and written agreements with operators regarding the application of the operators' and contractors' safety and environmental policies at the worksite. In addition, BSEE has stated that future rulemaking may require offshore drilling contractors to implement their own SEMS programs. The current SEMS regulations and the possibility of additional SEMS rules for contractors could expose us to increased costs.\nIn 2012, BSEE also issued an interim policy document for use by BSEE inspectors in issuing incidents of noncompliance (\u201cINCs\u201d) to contractors operating under BSEE jurisdiction on the Outer Continental Shelf of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The stated purpose of the policy is to provide for consistency in application of BSEE enforcement authority by establishing guidelines for issuance of INCs to contractors in addition to operators. The policy indicates that BSEE's enforcement actions will continue to focus primarily on lessees and operators, but makes it clear that BSEE will \u201cin appropriate circumstances\u201d also issue INCs to contractors for \"serious violations\" of BSEE regulations. Further, the industry has adopted new standards, including API Standard 53 relating to the maintenance, inspection and testing of well control equipment. The imposition of INCs on contractors exposes us to fines and penalties for violation of BSEE regulations and the new standards expose us to increased costs and loss of revenue.\nSince 2014, the United States Coast Guard has proposed new regulations that would impose GPS equipment and positioning requirements for mobile offshore drilling units and jackup rigs operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and issued notices regarding the development of regulations for cybersecurity measures used in the marine and offshore energy sectors for all vessels and facilities that are subject to the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, including our rigs. In April 2015, BSEE proposed new rules that, if and when enacted, would include more stringent design requirements for well control equipment used in offshore drilling operations. Based on our assessment of the proposed rules, we may incur significant costs to comply with the rules if they are adopted as proposed. We are continuing to evaluate the cost and effect that these proposed new rules will have on our operations. Implementation of further guidelines and regulations may subject us to increased costs and limit the operational capabilities of our rigs.\nNew regulatory, legislative, permitting or certification requirements in the U.S., including laws and regulations that have or may impose increased financial responsibility, oil spill abatement contingency plan capability requirements, or additional operational requirements and certifications, could materially adversely affect our financial condition, operating results or cash flows.\nWe anticipate that government regulation in other countries where we operate may follow the U.S. in regard to enhanced safety and environmental regulation, which could also result in governments imposing sanctions on contractors when operators fail to comply with regulations that impact drilling operations. Even if not a requirement in these countries, most international operating companies, and many others, are voluntarily complying with some or all of the U.S. inspections and safety and environmental guidelines when operating outside the U.S. Such additional\ngovernmental regulation and voluntary compliance by operators could increase the cost of our operations and expose us to greater liability.\nLaws and governmental regulations may add to costs, limit our drilling activity or reduce demand for our drilling services.\nOur operations are affected by political developments and by laws and regulations that relate directly to the oil and gas industry, including initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The offshore contract drilling industry is dependent on demand for services from the oil and gas industry. Accordingly, we will be directly affected by the approval and adoption of laws and regulations limiting or curtailing exploration and development drilling for oil and natural gas for economic, environmental, safety and other policy reasons. We may be exposed to risks related to new laws or regulations pertaining to climate change, carbon emissions or energy use that could reduce the use of oil or natural gas, thus reducing demand for hydrocarbon-based fuel and our drilling services. Governments also may pass laws or regulations encouraging or mandating the use of alternative energy sources, such as wind power and solar energy, which may reduce demand for oil and natural gas and our drilling services. Furthermore, we may be required to make significant capital expenditures or incur substantial additional costs to comply with new governmental laws and regulations. It is also possible that legislative and regulatory activity could adversely affect our operations by limiting drilling opportunities or significantly increasing our operating costs.\nGeopolitical events, terrorist attacks, piracy and military action could affect the markets for our services and have a material adverse effect on our business and cost and availability of insurance.\nGeopolitical events have resulted in military actions, terrorist, pirate and other armed attacks, civil unrest, political demonstrations, mass strikes and government responses. Military action by the United States or other nations could escalate, and acts of terrorism, piracy, kidnapping, extortion, acts of war, violence, civil war, or general disorder may initiate or continue. Such acts could be directed against companies such as ours. Such developments have caused instability in the world\u2019s financial and insurance markets in the past. In addition, these developments could lead to increased volatility in prices for oil and natural gas and could affect the markets for our products and services. Insurance premiums could increase and coverage for these kinds of events may be unavailable in the future. Any or all of these effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results or cash flows.\nFailure to recruit and retain skilled personnel could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nWe require skilled personnel to operate our drilling rigs and to provide technical services and support for our business. Historically, competition for the labor required for drilling operations and construction projects has intensified as the number of rigs activated, added to worldwide fleets or under construction increased, leading to shortages of qualified personnel in the industry. During such periods of intensified competition, it is more difficult and costly to recruit and retain qualified employees, especially in foreign countries that require a certain percentage of national employees. If competition for labor were to intensify in the future, we could experience an increase in operating expenses, with a resulting reduction in net income, and our ability to fully staff and operate our rigs could be negatively affected.\nWe may be required to maintain or increase existing levels of compensation to retain our skilled workforce, especially if our competitors raise their wage rates. We also are subject to potential legislative or regulatory action that may impact working conditions, paid time off or other conditions of employment. If such labor trends continue, they could further increase our costs or limit our ability to fully staff and operate our rigs.\nUnionization efforts and labor regulations in certain countries in which we operate could materially increase our costs or limit our flexibility.\nOutside of the U.S., we are often subject to collective bargaining agreements that require periodic salary negotiations, which usually result in higher personnel expenses and other benefits. Efforts have been made from time to time to unionize other portions of our workforce. In addition, we have been subjected to strikes or work stoppages\nand other labor disruptions in certain countries. Additional unionization efforts, new collective bargaining agreements or work stoppages could materially increase our costs, reduce our revenues or limit our flexibility.\nCertain legal obligations require us to contribute certain amounts to retirement funds or other benefit plans and restrict our ability to dismiss employees. Future regulations or court interpretations established in the countries in which we conduct our operations could increase our costs and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows.\nCompliance with or breach of environmental laws can be costly and could limit our operations.\nOur operations are subject to laws and regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, pollution, contamination and hazardous waste disposal or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Environmental laws and regulations specifically applicable to our business activities could impose significant liability on us for damages, clean-up costs, fines and penalties in the event of oil spills or similar discharges of pollutants or contaminants into the environment or improper disposal of hazardous waste generated in the course of our operations. To date, such laws and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our operating results, and we have not experienced an accident that has exposed us to material liability arising out of or relating to discharges of pollutants into the environment. However, the legislative, judicial and regulatory response to a well incident could substantially increase our and our customers' liabilities. In addition to potential increased liabilities, such legislative, judicial or regulatory action could impose increased financial, insurance or other requirements that may adversely impact the entire offshore drilling industry.\nThe International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Cooperation, Marpol 73/78, the U.K. Merchant Shipping Act 1995, the U.K. Merchant Shipping (Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Cooperation Convention) Regulations 1998, and other related legislation and regulations and Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (\"OPA 90\"), the Clean Water Act and other U.S. federal statutes applicable to us and our operations, as well as similar statutes in Texas, Louisiana, other coastal states and other non-U.S. jurisdictions, address oil spill prevention and control and significantly expand liability, fine and penalty exposure across many segments of the oil and gas industry. Such statutes and related regulations impose a variety of obligations on us related to the prevention of oil spills, disposal of waste and liability for resulting damages. For instance, OPA 90 imposes strict and, with limited exceptions, joint and several liability upon each responsible party for oil removal costs as well as a variety of fines, penalties and damages. Although the OPA 90 provides for certain limits of liability, such limits are not applicable where there is any safety violation or where gross negligence is involved. Failure to comply with these statutes and regulations, including OPA 90, may subject us to civil or criminal enforcement action, which may not be covered by contractual indemnification or insurance and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results and cash flows. Further, remedies under the Clean Water Act and related legislation and the OPA 90 do not preclude claims under state regulations or civil claims for damages to third parties under state laws.\nEvents in recent years, including the Macondo well incident, have heightened governmental and environmental concerns about the risks associated with offshore oil and gas drilling. We are adversely affected by restrictions on drilling in certain areas in which we operate, including policies and guidelines regarding the approval of drilling permits, restrictions on development and production activities, and directives and regulations that have and may further impact our operations. From time to time, legislative and regulatory proposals have been introduced that would materially limit or prohibit offshore drilling in certain areas, or that would increase the liabilities or costs associated with offshore drilling. If new laws are enacted, or if government actions are taken that restrict or prohibit offshore drilling in our principal areas of operation or that impose environmental or other requirements that materially increase the liabilities, financial requirements or operating or equipment costs associated with offshore drilling, exploration, development, or production of oil and natural gas, our financial position, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur debt levels and debt agreement restrictions may limit our liquidity and flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $5.9 billion in total debt outstanding, representing approximately 47.5% of our total capitalization. Our current indebtedness may have several important effects on our future operations, including:\n\u2022\na portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest,\n\u2022\ncovenants contained in our debt arrangements require us to meet certain financial tests, which may affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in our business and may limit our ability to dispose of assets or place restrictions on the use of proceeds from such dispositions, withstand current or future economic or industry downturns and compete with others in our industry for strategic opportunities, and\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and general corporate or other cash requirements may be limited.\nOur ability to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity to meet our financial obligations will be dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. Our future cash flows may be insufficient to meet all of our working capital requirements, debt obligations and contractual commitments, and any insufficiency could negatively impact our business.\nTo the extent we are unable to repay our debt as it becomes due with cash on hand or from other sources, we will need to refinance our debt, sell assets or repay the debt with the proceeds from equity offerings. Additional indebtedness or equity financing may not be available to us in the future for the refinancing or repayment of existing debt, or if available, such additional debt or equity financing may not be available on a timely basis, or on terms acceptable to us and within the limitations specified in our then existing debt instruments. In addition, in the event we decide to sell additional assets, we can provide no assurance as to the timing of any asset sales or the proceeds that could be realized by us from any such asset sale.\nIn addition, our access to credit and capital markets depends on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any additional actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade, could limit our ability to access credit and capital markets, or to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. In addition, future financings or refinancings may result in higher borrowing costs and require more restrictive terms and covenants, which may further restrict our operations. If we are downgraded below investment grade by one or more credit rating agencies, we may have limited or no access to the commercial paper market. Any downgrade or anticipated downgrade in our credit ratings, particularly below investment grade, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe have historically made substantial capital expenditures to maintain our fleet, and we may be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain our competitiveness, to comply with laws and the applicable regulations and standards of governmental authorities and organizations, or to expand our fleet, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition, result of operations and cash flows.\nWe have historically made substantial capital expenditures to maintain our fleet. These expenditures could increase as a result of changes in:\n\u2022\noffshore drilling technology,\n\u2022\nthe cost of labor and materials,\n\u2022\ncustomer requirements,\n\u2022\nfleet size,\n\u2022\nthe cost of replacement parts for existing drilling rigs,\n\u2022\nthe geographic location of the drilling rigs,\n\u2022\nlength of drilling contracts,\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulations and maritime self-regulatory organization and technical standards relating to safety, security or the environment, and\n\u2022\nindustry standards.\nChanges in offshore drilling technology, customer requirements for new or upgraded equipment and competition within our industry may require us to make significant capital expenditures in order to maintain our competitiveness. In addition, changes in governmental regulations, relating to safety or equipment standards, as well as compliance with standards imposed by maritime self-regulatory organizations, may require us to make additional unforeseen capital expenditures. As a result, we may be required to take our rigs out of service for extended periods of time, with corresponding losses of revenues, in order to make such alterations or to add such equipment. In the future, market conditions may not justify these expenditures or enable us to operate our older rigs profitably during the remainder of their economic lives.\nAdditionally, in order to expand our fleet, we may require additional capital in the future. If we are unable to fund capital with cash flows from operations or sales of non-core assets, we may be required to either incur additional borrowings or raise capital through the sale of debt or equity securities. Our ability to access the capital markets may be limited by our financial condition at the time, by changes in laws and regulations (or interpretation thereof) and by adverse market conditions resulting from, among other things, general economic conditions and contingencies and uncertainties that are beyond our control. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, existing shareholders may experience dilution. Our failure to obtain the funds for necessary future capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business and on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSignificant part or equipment shortages, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions, supplier\nquality and sourcing issues or price increases could increase our operating costs, decrease our revenues and adversely impact our operations.\nOur reliance on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to secure equipment, parts, components and sub-systems used in our operations exposes us to potential volatility in the quality, prices and availability of such items. Certain high-specification parts and equipment that we use in our operations may be available only from a small number of suppliers, manufacturers or service providers, or in some cases must be sourced through a single supplier, manufacturer or service provider. Recent industry consolidation has reduced the number of available suppliers. A disruption in the deliveries from such third-party suppliers, manufacturers or service providers, capacity constraints, production disruptions, price increases, quality control issues, recalls or other decreased availability of parts and equipment could adversely affect our ability to meet our commitments to customers, thus adversely impacting our operations and revenues or increase our operating costs.\nOur long-term contracts are subject to the risk of cost increases, which could adversely impact our profitability.\nIn general, our costs increase as the demand for contract drilling services and skilled labor increases. While many of our contracts include cost escalation provisions that allow changes to our day rate based on stipulated cost increases or decreases, the timing and amount earned from these day rate adjustments may differ from our actual increase in costs and certain contracts do not allow for such day rate adjustments. During times of reduced demand, reductions in costs may not be immediate as portions of the crew may be required to prepare our rigs for stacking, after which time the crew members are assigned to active rigs or dismissed. Moreover, as our rigs are mobilized from one geographic location to another, the labor and other operating and maintenance costs can vary significantly. In general, labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels and inflation. Equipment maintenance expenses fluctuate depending upon the type of activity a drilling rig is performing and the age and condition of the equipment. Contract preparation expenses vary based on the scope and length of contract preparation required.\nOur information technology systems are subject to cybersecurity risks and threats.\nWe depend on technologies, systems, and networks to conduct our offshore and onshore operations, to collect payments from customers and to pay vendors and employees. The risks associated with cyber incidents and attacks to our information technology systems could include disruptions of certain systems on our rigs; other impairments of our ability to conduct our operations; loss of intellectual property, proprietary information or customer data; disruption of our customers' operations; and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events. If we were to experience a cyber-attack or incident, it could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nGovernments may pass laws that subject us to additional taxation or may challenge our tax positions, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThere is increasing uncertainty with respect to tax laws, regulations and treaties, and the interpretation and enforcement thereof that may affect our business. For example, the U.K., the U.S. and other countries within which we operate are currently evaluating legislative and regulatory reforms that may result in us being subject to additional taxation or to challenges with respect to the tax positions we adopt. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) recently issued its final reports on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, which generally focus on situations where profits are earned in low-tax jurisdictions, or payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. Based on the recommendations of the OECD, it is possible that a number of relevant countries may enact changes to their tax laws or practices (prospectively or retroactively), in particular with respect to transfer pricing, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results and/or cash flows.\nIn addition, our tax positions are subject to audit by U.K., U.S. and other foreign tax authorities. Such tax authorities may disagree with our interpretations or assessments of the effects of tax laws, treaties, or regulations or\ntheir applicability to our corporate structure or certain transactions we have undertaken. Even if we are successful in maintaining our tax positions, we may incur significant expenses in defending our positions and contesting claims asserted by tax authorities. If we are unsuccessful in defending our tax positions, the resulting assessments or ruling could significantly impact our consolidated effective income tax rate in past or future periods.\nAs a result of these uncertainties, as well as changes in the administrative practices and precedents of tax authorities or other matter (such as changes in applicable accounting rules) that increases the amounts we have provided for income taxes or deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements, we cannot provide any assurances as to what our consolidated effective income tax rate will be in future periods. If we are unable to mitigate the negative consequences of any change in law, audit or other matter, this could cause our consolidated effective income tax rate to increase and cause a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results and/or cash flows.\nOur consolidated effective income tax rate may vary substantially from one reporting period to another.\nWe cannot provide any assurances as to what our consolidated effective income tax rate will be because of, among other matters, uncertainty regarding the nature and extent of our business activities in any particular jurisdiction in the future and the tax laws of such jurisdictions, as well as potential changes in U.K., U.S. and other foreign tax laws, regulations or treaties or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, changes in the administrative practices and precedents of tax authorities or any reclassification or other matter (such as changes in applicable accounting rules) that increases the amounts we have provided for income taxes or deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, as a result of frequent changes in the taxing jurisdictions in which our drilling rigs are operated and/or owned, changes in the overall level of our income and changes in tax laws, our consolidated effective income tax rate may vary substantially from one reporting period to another. Income tax rates imposed in the tax jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries conduct operations vary, as does the tax base to which the rates are applied. In some cases, tax rates may be applicable to gross revenues, statutory or negotiated deemed profits or other bases utilized under local tax laws, rather than to net income. Our drilling rigs frequently move from one taxing jurisdiction to another to perform contract drilling services. In some instances, the movement of drilling rigs among taxing jurisdictions will involve the transfer of ownership of the drilling rigs among our subsidiaries. If we are unable to mitigate the negative consequences of any change in law, audit, business activity or other matter, this could cause our consolidated effective income tax rate to increase and cause a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results and/or cash flows.\nTransfers of our Class A ordinary shares may be subject to stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax (\u201cSDRT\u201d) in the U.K., which would increase the cost of dealing in our Class A ordinary shares.\nStamp duty and/or SDRT are imposed in the U.K. on certain transfers of chargeable securities (which include shares in companies incorporated in the U.K.) at a rate of 0.5% of the consideration paid for the transfer. Certain transfers of shares to depositary receipt facilities or clearance systems providers are charged at a higher rate of 1.5%.\nPursuant to arrangements that we entered into with the Depository Trust Company (\u201cDTC\u201d), our Class A ordinary shares are eligible to be held in book entry form through the facilities of DTC. Transfers of shares held in book entry form through DTC will not attract a charge to stamp duty or SDRT in the U.K. A transfer of the shares from within the DTC system out of DTC and any subsequent transfers that occur entirely outside the DTC system will attract a charge to stamp duty at a rate of 0.5% of any consideration, which is payable by the transferee of the shares. Any such duty must be paid (and the relevant transfer document stamped by Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs (\u201cHMRC\u201d)) before the transfer can be registered in the share register of Ensco plc. If a shareholder decides to redeposit shares into DTC, the redeposit will attract SDRT at a rate of 1.5% of the value of the shares.\nWe have put in place arrangements with our transfer agent to require that shares held in certificated form cannot be transferred into the DTC system until the transferor of the shares has first delivered the shares to a depository specified by us so that SDRT may be collected in connection with the initial delivery to the depository. Any such shares will be evidenced by a receipt issued by the depository. Before the transfer can be registered in our share register, the\ntransferor will also be required to provide the transfer agent sufficient funds to settle the resultant liability for SDRT, which will be charged at a rate of 1.5% of the value of the shares.\nWe have obtained a favorable ruling from HMRC in respect of stamp duty and SDRT in relation to both the conversion of our outstanding American Depositary Shares (\u201cADS\u201d) into Class A ordinary shares in May 2012 and our arrangement with DTC. Furthermore, following decisions of the European Court of Justice and the U.K. First-tier Tax Tribunal, HMRC has announced that it will not seek to apply a charge to stamp duty or SDRT on the issuance of shares (or, where it is integral to the raising of new capital, the transfer of new shares) into a depositary receipt facility or clearance system provider, such as DTC. However, it is possible that the U.K. government may change or enact laws applicable to stamp duty or SDRT in response to this decision, which could have a material effect on the cost of trading in our shares.\nIf the Class A ordinary shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearing within the facilities of DTC, then transactions in our securities may be disrupted.\nThe facilities of DTC are widely-used for rapid electronic transfers of securities between participants within the DTC system, which include numerous major international financial institutions and brokerage firms. Currently, all trades of our Class A ordinary shares on the NYSE are cleared and settled on the facilities of DTC. Our Class A ordinary shares are, at present, eligible for deposit and clearing within the DTC system, pursuant to arrangements with DTC whereby DTC accepted our Class A ordinary shares for deposit, clearing and settlement services, and we agreed to indemnify DTC for any stamp duty and/or SDRT that may be assessed upon it as a result of its service as a clearance system provider for our Class A ordinary shares. However, DTC retains sole discretion to cease to act as a clearance system provider for our Class A ordinary shares at any time.\nIf DTC determines at any time that our shares are no longer eligible for deposit, clearing and settlement services within its facilities, our shares may become ineligible for continued listing on a U.S. securities exchange or inclusion in the S&P 500, and trading in such shares would be disrupted. In this event, DTC has agreed it will provide us advance notice and assist us, to the extent possible, with efforts to mitigate adverse consequences. While we would pursue alternative arrangements to preserve our listing and maintain trading, any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our Class A ordinary shares.\nInvestor enforcement of civil judgments against us may be more difficult.\nBecause our parent company is a public limited company incorporated under the Laws of England and Wales, investors could experience more difficulty enforcing judgments obtained against us in U.S. courts than would have been the case for U.S. judgments obtained against us prior to the redomestication. In addition, it may be more difficult (or impossible) to bring some types of claims against us in courts in England than it would be to bring similar claims against a U.S. company in a U.S. court.\nWe have less flexibility as a U.K. public limited company with respect to certain aspects of capital management than U.S. corporations due to increased shareholder approval requirements.\nDirectors of Delaware and other U.S. corporations may issue, without further shareholder approval, shares of common stock authorized in their certificates of incorporation that were not already issued or reserved. The business corporation laws of Delaware and other U.S. states also provide substantial flexibility in establishing the terms of preferred stock. However, English law provides that a board of directors may only allot shares with the prior authorization of an ordinary resolution of the shareholders, which authorization must state the maximum amount of shares that may be allotted under it and specify the date on which it will expire, which must not be more than five years from the date on which the shareholder resolution is passed. An ordinary resolution was passed by shareholders at our last annual meeting in 2015 to authorize the allotment of additional shares for a one-year term. As this authority will expire in May 2016, an ordinary resolution will be put to shareholders at our next annual shareholder meeting seeking their approval to renew the board's authority to allot shares for an additional one-year term.\nEnglish law also generally provides shareholders pre-emption rights over new shares that are issued for cash. However, it is possible, where the board of directors is generally authorized to allot shares, to exclude pre-emption rights by a special resolution of the shareholders or by a provision in the articles of association. Such exclusion of pre-emption rights will commonly cease to have effect at the same time as the general allotment authority to which it relates is revoked or expires. If the general allotment authority is renewed, the authority excluding pre-emption rights may also be renewed by a special resolution of the shareholders. A special resolution was passed, in conjunction with an allotment authority at our last annual shareholder meeting in 2015, to exclude pre-emption rights for a one-year term. As this authority will expire in May 2016, a special resolution will be put to shareholders at our next annual shareholder meeting seeking their approval to renew the board's authority to exclude pre-emption rights for an additional one-year term.\nEnglish law prohibits us from conducting \"on-market purchases\" as our shares will not be traded on a recognized investment exchange in the U.K. English law also generally prohibits a company from repurchasing its own shares by way of \"off-market purchases\" without the approval by a special resolution of the shareholders of the terms of the contract by which the purchase(s) is affected. Such approval may only last for a maximum period of five years after the date on which the resolution is passed. A special resolution was passed at the Company's annual shareholder meeting in May 2013 to permit the Company to make \"off-market\" purchases of its own shares pursuant to certain purchase agreements for a five-year term.\nWe have no assurances that situations will not arise where such shareholder approval requirements for any of these actions would deprive our shareholders of substantial benefits.\nOur articles of association contain anti-takeover provisions.\nCertain provisions of our articles of association have anti-takeover effects, such as the ability to issue shares under the Rights Plan (as defined therein). These provisions are intended to ensure that any takeover or change of control of the Company is conducted in an orderly manner, all members of the Company are treated equally and fairly and receive an optimum price for their shares and the long-term success of the Company is safeguarded. Under English law, it may not be possible to implement these provisions in all circumstances.\nThe Company is not subject to the U.K.'s Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the \u201cCode\u201d).\nThe Code only applies to an offer for a public company that is registered in the U.K. (or the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man) and the securities of which are not admitted to trading on a regulated market in the U.K. (or the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man) if the company is considered by the Takeover Panel to have its place of central management and control in the U.K. (or the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man). This is known as the \"residency test.\" The test for central management and control under the Takeover Code is different from that used by the U.K. tax authorities. Under the Takeover Code, the Panel will look to where the majority of the directors of the company are themselves resident for the purposes of determining where the company has its place of central management and control. Accordingly, the Code does not currently apply to the Company and the Company therefore does not have the benefit of the protections the Code affords, including, but not limited to, the requirement that a person who acquires an interest in shares carrying 30% or more of the voting rights in the Company must make a cash offer to all other shareholders at the highest price paid in the 12 months before the offer was announced.\nEnglish law requires that we meet certain additional financial requirements before we declare dividends and return funds to shareholders.\nUnder English law, we are only able to declare dividends and return funds to our shareholders out of the accumulated distributable reserves on our statutory balance sheet. Distributable reserves are a company\u2019s accumulated, realized profits, so far as not previously utilized by distribution or capitalization, less its accumulated, realized losses, so far as not previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital duly made. Realized profits are created through the remittance of profits of certain subsidiaries to our parent company in the form of dividends.\nEnglish law also provides that a public company can only make a distribution if, among other things (a) the amount of its net assets (that is, the total excess of assets over liabilities) is not less than the total of its called up share capital and non-distributable reserves and (b) if, and to the extent that, the distribution does not reduce the amount of its net assets to less than that total.\nWe may be unable to remit the profits of our subsidiaries in a timely or tax efficient manner. If at any time we do not have sufficient distributable reserves to declare and pay quarterly dividends, we may undertake a reduction in the capital of the Company, in addition to the reduction in capital taken in 2014, to reduce the amount of our share capital and non-distributable reserves and to create a corresponding increase in our distributable reserves out of which future distributions to shareholders can be made. To comply with English law, a reduction of capital would be subject to (a) approval of shareholders at the annual shareholder meeting by special resolution; (b) confirmation by an order of the English Courts and (c) the Court order being delivered to and registered by the Registrar of Companies in England. If we were to pursue a reduction of capital of the Company as a course of action, and failed to obtain the necessary approvals from shareholders and the English Courts, we may undertake other efforts to allow the Company to declare dividends and return funds to shareholders.", "PERMNO": 62519, "SIC": 1381, "TIC": "VALPQ"}
