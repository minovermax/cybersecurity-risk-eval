Before deciding whether to invest in our common stock, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in this Annual Report. If any of the risks or uncertainties described herein actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, resulting in a loss of all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties we have described are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nTeraWulf has a limited operating history, which could negatively impact its operations, strategy and financial performance.\nTeraWulf was incorporated in 2021, and its bitcoin mining business is in its early stages. Furthermore, bitcoin, energy pricing and bitcoin mining economics are volatile and subject to uncertainty. TeraWulf\u2019s current strategy will continue to expose it to the numerous risks and volatility associated with the bitcoin mining and power generation sectors, including fluctuating bitcoin to U.S. dollar prices, the costs of bitcoin miners, the number of market participants mining bitcoin, the global network hashrate, the availability of other power generation facilities or power grid interconnections to expand operations and regulatory changes.\nIf, among other things, the price of bitcoin declines or mining economics become prohibitive, TeraWulf could incur future losses. Such losses could be significant as it incurs costs and expenses associated with the development and operation of its mining facilities, as well as legal and administrative related expenses.\nWhile TeraWulf closely monitors its cash balances, cash needs and expense levels, significant expense increases may not be offset by a corresponding increase in revenue or a significant decline in bitcoin prices could significantly impact its financial condition and results of operations.\nIf TeraWulf is unable to successfully maintain its Equipment Supply Agreements on acceptable terms or at all, TeraWulf \u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nMining bitcoin requires access to massive amounts of electrical power and relationships with leading mining equipment manufacturers. Furthermore, consistent with TeraWulf\u2019s carbon mandate, TeraWulf\u2019s activities must be supported by sustainable energy sources. A limited number of suppliers produce mining equipment to power sustainable industrial-scale mining. Any shortage of mining equipment may negatively impact the viability and expected economic return for TeraWulf\u2019s bitcoin mining activities.\nTeraWulf has structured and secured competitive equipment supply agreements to purchase state-of-the- art mining equipment from Bitmain Technologies Limited (\u201cBitmain\u201d) and Minerva. Since its inception, TeraWulf has executed an equipment purchase agreement with Minerva and four non-fixed price sales and purchase agreements with Bitmain. TeraWulf will be highly dependent on the Minerva agreement and the Bitmain Agreements (collectively, the \u201cEquipment Supply Agreements\u201d) for the development of its business models.\nTeraWulf cannot guarantee that it will ultimately be able to successfully execute the Equipment Supply Agreements on terms acceptable to both TeraWulf\u2019s management team and Bitmain or Minerva, as applicable. Despite securing Equipment Supply Agreements that provide for delivery of an aggregate total of 58,000 miners between January 2022 and December 2022, such Equipment Supply Agreements are subject to uncertain contractual provisions that could, under certain conditions, leave TeraWulf without adequate or sufficient equipment for its mining operations. Under the Equipment Supply Agreements, the total purchase price is an estimated price, with the actual price to be determined at a specified timeframe before shipment of the respective batch of miners. In addition, each batch of miners constitutes independent legal obligations, and TeraWulf will have limited legal recourse in the event of delays to the delivery date.\nFurthermore, the Bitmain Agreements are solely governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Hong Kong. In the event that geopolitical turmoil, political instability, civil disturbances and restrictive government actions cause changes to the laws of Hong Kong, TeraWulf could face difficulties enforcing rights and obligations between the parties in the Bitmain Agreements. The Minerva agreement is governed by the laws of the Province of Alberta, Canada without regard to any conflict of law provisions that might otherwise apply. Such contractual provisions leave TeraWulf with limited avenues for legal recourse in the event of disputes between the parties.\nIf TeraWulf is unable to successfully maintain such agreements or TeraWulf\u2019s counterparties fail to perform their obligations under the final agreements, TeraWulf may be forced to look for alternative power providers. There is no assurance that TeraWulf will be able to find alternative suppliers on acceptable terms in a timely manner, or at all. Any significant nonperformance by suppliers could have a material adverse effect on TeraWulf\u2019s business prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nThe properties utilized by TeraWulf in its bitcoin mining operations may experience damage or losses, including damage or losses not covered by insurance.\nTeraWulf\u2019s bitcoin mining operations that are being established in Barker, New York, and Salem, Pennsylvania, are, and any future bitcoin mining operations that it establishes will be, subject to a variety of risks relating to its physical condition and operation, including, among others:\n\u25cf the presence of construction or repair defects or other structural or building damage;\n\u25cf any noncompliance with, or liabilities under, applicable environmental, health or safety regulations or requirements or building permit requirements;\n\u25cf any damage resulting from natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, floods and windstorms;\n\u25cf damage caused by criminal actors, such as cyberattacks, vandalism, sabotage or terrorist attacks; and\n\u25cf claims by employees and others for injuries sustained at its properties.\nAny of these could render TeraWulf\u2019s bitcoin mining operations inoperable, temporarily or permanently, and the potential impact on TeraWulf\u2019s business is currently magnified due to the limited number of sites for which bitcoin mining is currently planned.\nThe security and other measures TeraWulf will take to protect against these risks may be insufficient or unavailable. In addition, TeraWulf\u2019s insurance may not be adequate to cover the losses it suffers as a result of these risks.\nLimitations on the availability of sites to establish mining operations may adversely affect TeraWulf \u2019s business prospects.\nTeraWulf is setting up its first two bitcoin mining facility sites in New York and Pennsylvania.\nTeraWulf began installing ASICs at the facility in New York in the first quarter of 2022 and plans to begin installation of ASICs at the facility in Pennsylvania by mid-year 2022. Funding for the remainder of TeraWulf\u2019s mining capacity buildout is expected to come from the cash flow generated from mining operations and additional capital raises. TeraWulf may not secure the sites for its mining operations in a reasonable timeframe and may also be subject to various governmental approvals. Furthermore, TeraWulf may not be successful in identifying adequate sites to house its mining operations. In addition, the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of TeraWulf provides that TeraWulf renounces any interest or expectancy with respect to, among others, business opportunities relating to the bitcoin mining business in Hardin, Montana, in connection with building and operation by affiliates of Beowulf Energy LLC of a data center for Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. (f/k/a Marathon Patent Group, Inc.). As a result, TeraWulf will be prevented from establishing a bitcoin mining facility in Hardin, Montana and/or from using the power from the Hardin Power Station for the operation of its own bitcoin mining facilities.\nFurthermore, even if TeraWulf is successful in identifying such sites, TeraWulf may not be successful in leasing the necessary facilities at rates that are economically viable to support its mining activities.\nTeraWulf depends on nuclear energy to power a significant portion of its bitcoin mining capacity and may be held liable for damages, regardless of fault, if incidents or evacuations were to occur at the mining facility site that utilizes nuclear energy.\nThe Nautilus Cryptomine Facility is expected to be one of the first bitcoin mining facilities powered by 100% zero-carbon nuclear energy and have access to up to 300 megawatts of gross power capacity. This amount of power represents a significant portion of TeraWulf\u2019s total mining capacity. If a nuclear-related incident or evacuation were to occur, TeraWulf could be held liable for damages, regardless of fault.\nAddressing such an occurrence may require the allocation of significant time and divert management\u2019s focus away from revenue-generating activities. In addition, a nuclear-related incident could result in the payment of significant monetary damages. Any downtime during which TeraWulf is unable to mine at this facility site or any forced shut down may have an adverse effect on TeraWulf\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nSince the development, construction and operation of the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility is subject to the terms of a joint venture agreement, TeraWulf may have less control over strategic decisions.\nOn May 13, 2021, TeraWulf entered into a joint venture agreement with an affiliate of Talen Energy Corporation (\u201cTalen\u201d). The joint venture agreement provides that, except for certain specified matters, decisions are to be made by a majority vote of the board of managers. The board of managers is comprised of two managers appointed by TeraWulf and three managers appointed by Talen. Any significant disagreements between joint venture partners on strategic decisions or the inability of the Talen affiliate to meet obligations to the joint venture or third parties may impede TeraWulf\u2019s ability to control aspects of the development, construction, and operation of the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility.\nTeraWulf \u2019s management team has limited experience managing a public company.\nThe members of the management team have not previously served as management of a publicly traded company and may not have experience complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. TeraWulf\u2019s management team may not successfully or efficiently manage its immediate transition to being a public company subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws as well as the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These new obligations and constituents will require significant attention from TeraWulf\u2019s management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of TeraWulf\u2019s business, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTeraWulf depends on its management team and other key personnel, and the loss of their services would have a material adverse effect on TeraWulf.\nTeraWulf\u2019s success depends on the efforts, judgment and personal reputations of its management team and other key personnel. Their reputations, expertise and relationships with members of the business communities whom TeraWulf depends on for business opportunities and financing are each a critical element in operating and expanding TeraWulf\u2019s business. The loss of the services of its management team or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on TeraWulf and its performance, including its ability to retain and attract investors and raise capital.\nTeraWulf does not maintain any key person life insurance policies. The loss of any member of its management team or other key personnel could make it more difficult to execute its business strategy and, therefore, harm its business.\nTeraWulf \u2019s future success depends on its ability to expand its organization to match the growth of its activities, and any failure to manage its growth effectively could place strains on its managerial, operational and financial resources and could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs TeraWulf\u2019s operations grow, the administrative demands upon TeraWulf will grow, and its success will depend upon its ability to meet those demands. TeraWulf is organized as a holding company with numerous subsidiaries. Both the parent company and each of its subsidiaries require certain financial, managerial and other resources, which could create challenges to its ability to successfully manage its subsidiaries and operations and impact its ability to assure compliance with its policies, practices and procedures. These demands include, among others, increased executive, accounting, management, legal services, staff support and general office services. TeraWulf may need to hire additional qualified personnel to meet these demands, the cost and quality of which depends in part upon market factors outside of its control. Further, TeraWulf will need to effectively manage the training and growth of its staff to maintain an efficient and effective workforce, and TeraWulf\u2019s failure to do so could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. Currently, TeraWulf has limited personnel in its organization to meet its organizational and administrative demands. Although TeraWulf may not grow as it expects, if TeraWulf fails to manage its growth effectively or to develop and expand its managerial, operational and financial resources and systems, TeraWulf\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially harmed.\nCOVID-19 or any pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease in the United States or elsewhere may adversely affect TeraWulf \u2019s business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had unpredictable and unprecedented impacts in the United States and around the world. The outbreak of COVID-19, which the World Health Organization declared a pandemic in March 2020, has spread across the globe and has led to disruption in the global economy and the digital asset industry. International, federal, state and local public health and governmental authorities have taken extraordinary and wide-ranging actions to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 in regions across the United States and the world, including mandates for many individuals to substantially restrict daily activities and for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic continues or worsens, governments may impose additional similar restrictions. The extent and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. TeraWulf cannot offer any assurance that the COVID-19 pandemic or any other pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease in the United States or elsewhere will not materially and adversely affect TeraWulf\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTeraWulf\u2019s business was adversely impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular as a result of increased competition spurred by a decline in energy prices, and may continue to be adversely impacted in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to adversely affect the economies of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that may have an adverse effect on financial markets, energy and bitcoin prices, the demand for bitcoin and other factors that could impact TeraWulf\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTeraWulf faces risks and disruptions related to supply chain issues, including in semiconductors and other necessary application specific integrated circuit components, which could significantly impact its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChina has limited the shipment of certain products in and out of its borders, which could negatively impact TeraWulf\u2019s ability to receive bitcoin mining equipment from its China-based suppliers. TeraWulf\u2019s third-party manufacturers, suppliers, sub-contractors and customers have been disrupted by worker absenteeism, quarantines, restrictions on employees\u2019 ability to work, office and factory closures, disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure, border closures or other travel or health-related restrictions, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Depending on the magnitude of such effects on TeraWulf\u2019s supply chain, shipments of parts for its existing miners, as well as any new miners TeraWulf purchases, may be delayed.\nAs its miners require repair or become obsolete and require replacement, TeraWulf\u2019s ability to obtain adequate replacements or repair parts from their manufacturer may be hampered. Supply chain disruptions could therefore negatively impact TeraWulf\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, many of the competitors in our industry have also been purchasing mining equipment at scale, which has caused a world-wide shortage of mining equipment and extended the corresponding delivery schedules for new miner purchases. There are no assurances that our manufacturers Bitmain and Minerva, or any other manufacturers, will be able to keep pace with the surge in demand for mining equipment. It is uncertain how manufacturers will respond to this increased global demand and whether they can deliver on the schedules promised to all of their customers. In the event Bitmain, Minerva or other manufacturers are not able to keep pace with demand, we may not be able to purchase miners from Bitmain, Minerva or other manufacturers in sufficient quantities or on the delivery schedules that meet our business needs.\nThe cost of obtaining new and replacement miners and parts has historically been capital intensive, and is likely to continue to be very capital intensive, which may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur mining operations can only be successful and ultimately profitable if the costs, including hardware and electricity costs, associated with mining cryptocurrencies are lower than the price of the cryptocurrencies we mine when we sell them. Our miners experience ordinary wear and tear from operation and may also face more significant malfunctions caused by factors which may be beyond our control. Additionally, as the technology evolves, we may acquire newer models of miners to remain competitive in the market. Over time, we replace those miners which are no longer functional with new miners purchased from third-party manufacturers, who are primarily based in China.\nFor example, the 30,000 S19j Pro miners and 18,000 S19 XP miners we purchased from Bitmain and the 10,000 MV7 miners we purchased from Minerva in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 will eventually become obsolete or will degrade due to ordinary wear and tear from usage, and may also be lost or damaged due to factors outside of our control. Once this happens, these new miners will need to be repaired or replaced along with other equipment from time to time for us to stay competitive. This upgrading process requires substantial capital investment, and we may face challenges in doing so on a timely and cost-effective basis based on availability of new miners and our access to adequate capital resources. If we are unable to obtain adequate numbers of new and replacement miners at scale, we may be unable to remain competitive in our highly competitive and evolving industry. If this happens, we may not be able to mine cryptocurrency as efficiently or in similar amounts as our competition and, as a result, our business and financial results could suffer. This could, in turn, materially and adversely affect the trading price of our securities and our investors could lose part or all of their investment.\nThe price of new miners may be linked to the market price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and, if the current relatively high market price of bitcoin persists, our costs of obtaining new and replacement miners may increase, which may have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nReports have been released that the prices of new miners are adjusted according to the price of bitcoin. As a result, the cost of new machines can be unpredictable, and could also be significantly higher than our historical cost for new miners. Similarly, as bitcoin prices have risen, we have observed significant increase in the demand for miners. As a result, at times, we may obtain Bitmain miners and other hardware from Bitmain or from third parties at higher prices, to the extent they are available. For example, we observed a significant appreciation in the market price of bitcoin in the second half of 2020 through the first half of 2021, and simultaneously witnessed an increase in the per-unit price of the latest generation mining equipment. While we cannot know definitively whether these two phenomena are linked, we have seen a measurable increase in the prices for new miners offered by Bitmain as Bitcoin prices increase.\nTeraWulf will need to raise additional capital to meet its business requirements in the future, which capital raising may be costly or difficult to obtain or may not be obtained (in whole or in part) and, if obtained, will dilute the ownership interests of the TeraWulf \u2019s shareholders.\nTeraWulf had working capital of $22.7 million as of December 31, 2021. TeraWulf may require additional financing in the future to support its operations and may seek to raise additional financing in the future. TeraWulf may not be able to borrow or raise additional capital in the future to meet its needs or to otherwise provide the capital necessary to expand its operations and business, which might result in the value of the TeraWulf\u2019s common stock decreasing or becoming worthless. Additional financing may not be available to it on terms that are acceptable. Consequently, TeraWulf may not be able to proceed with its intended business plans. Obtaining additional financing contains risks, including, among others:\n\u25cf additional equity financing may not be available to TeraWulf on satisfactory terms and any equity TeraWulf is able to issue will lead to dilution of the ownership interests of TeraWulf\u2019s shareholders;\n\u25cf loans or other debt instruments may have terms and/or conditions, such as interest rate, restrictive covenants and control or revocation provisions, which are not acceptable to TeraWulf\u2019s board or its management; and\n\u25cf heightened restrictions and scrutiny of companies specifically involved with cryptocurrencies in the current capital market environment combined with TeraWulf\u2019s capital constraints may prevent TeraWulf from being able to obtain adequate debt financing.\nFailure to successfully complete or effectively manage divestitures that are not core to our business could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are a digital asset technology company with a core business of sustainable bitcoin mining. Our business combination with IKONICS contemplated the sale of the IKONICS legacy business as soon as reasonably practicable and within 18 months following the closing of the merger, whereby the Company would become solely a bitcoin-mining focused entity. Potential issues associated with the sale of IKONICS could include, among other things: our ability to complete or effectively manage the sale on terms commercially favorable to us or at all; our ability to realize the full extent of the expected returns, benefits, cost savings or synergies as a result of the sale, within the anticipated time frame, or at all; and diversion of management\u2019s attention from day-to-day operations. If the divestiture of IKONICS is not successfully completed or managed or does not result in the benefits or cost savings we expect, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nSecurity threats to TeraWulf could result in a loss of TeraWulf \u2019s digital assets or damage to the reputation of TeraWulf, each of which could adversely affect TeraWulf \u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSecurity breaches, computer malware, software supply chain attacks and computer hacking attacks have been a prevalent concern in the digital asset exchange markets. Any security breach caused by hacking, which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss, encryption or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses or ransomware could harm TeraWulf\u2019s business operations or result in loss of TeraWulf\u2019s digital assets. Furthermore, TeraWulf believes that, as its business grows, it may become a more appealing target for cybersecurity threats.\nTeraWulf will rely on enterprise cold storage custody solutions from third parties to safeguard its digital assets from theft, loss, destruction or other issues relating to hackers and technological attack. Nevertheless, cold storage security systems may not be impenetrable and may not be free from defect or immune to acts of God, and any loss due to a security breach, software defect or act of God will be borne by TeraWulf. TeraWulf\u2019s digital assets may also be stored with third-party exchanges prior to selling them. Third-party exchange systems may not be impenetrable and may not be free from defect or immune to acts of God, and any loss due to a security breach, software defect, supply chain attack or act of God may be borne by TeraWulf.\nThe security system and operational infrastructure may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, software defects, action of an employee of TeraWulf, or otherwise and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to TeraWulf\u2019s private keys, sensitive data control of miners or bitcoins. In addition, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees of TeraWulf to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to its infrastructure. As the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently, or may be designed to remain dormant until a predetermined event and often are not recognized until launched against a target, TeraWulf may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of TeraWulf\u2019s security system occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of TeraWulf\u2019s security system could be harmed, which could adversely affect TeraWulf\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the event of a security breach, TeraWulf may be forced to cease operations or suffer a reduction in digital assets, which could adversely affect TeraWulf\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNecessary capital financing may not be available at economic rates or at all.\nTurmoil in the credit and financial markets could adversely affect financial institutions, inhibit lending and limit TeraWulf\u2019s access to bank financing or other financing in the public or private capital markets on terms TeraWulf believes to be reasonable. Prevailing market conditions could be adversely affected by the ongoing disruptions in domestic or overseas sovereign or corporate debt markets, low commodity prices or other factors impacting TeraWulf\u2019s business, contractions or limited growth in the economy or other similar adverse economic developments in the U.S. or abroad. Instability in the global financial markets has from time to time resulted in periodic volatility in the capital markets. This volatility could limit TeraWulf\u2019s access to the credit markets, leading to higher borrowing costs or, in some cases, the inability to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to TeraWulf, or at all. Any such failure to obtain additional financing could jeopardize TeraWulf\u2019s ability to repay, refinance or reduce its debt obligations, or to meet its other financial commitments. Exposure to and regulation of bitcoin and/or cryptocurrency mining may preclude access to certain sources of institutional capital.\nFrom time to time, TeraWulf will be subject to various claims, litigation and other proceedings, as well as regulatory scrutiny, which could ultimately be resolved against TeraWulf, requiring material future cash payments or charges, which could impair TeraWulf \u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe size, nature and complexity of the Company\u2019s business could make it susceptible to various claims, both in litigation and binding arbitration proceedings, as well as regulatory scrutiny. The Company believes that since cryptocurrency mining - and the digital asset industry generally - is a relatively new business sector, it is more likely subject to investigation and regulatory determination. Any claims, regulatory proceedings or litigation that could arise in the course of the Company\u2019s business could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its business or operations, or the industry as a whole.\nRisks Relating to Digital Asset Networks and Digital Assets\nDigital assets, such as bitcoin, may become regulated as securities or investment securities.\nBitcoin is the oldest and most well-known form of digital asset. Bitcoin and other forms of digital assets / cryptocurrencies have been the source of much regulatory scrutiny, which has resulted in differing definitional outcomes without a single unifying statement. In the context of the offer and sale of the Initial Coin Offering (\u201cICO\u201d) tokens, the SEC has determined certain digital tokens are securities under the Howey test as stated by the U.S. Supreme Court. ICO offerings of securities would require registration under the Securities Act or an available exemption therefrom for offers or sales in the United States to be lawful. Section 5(a) of the Securities Act provides that, unless a registration statement is in effect as to a security, it is unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, to engage in the offer or sale of securities in interstate commerce. Furthermore, Section 5(c) of the Securities Act provides a similar prohibition against offers to sell, or offers to buy, unless a registration statement has been filed. Although the Company does not believe its mining activities require registration for it to conduct such activities and accumulate digital assets, the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d), Nasdaq or other governmental or quasi- governmental agency or organization may conclude that the Company\u2019s activities involve the offer or sale of \u201csecurities,\u201d or ownership of \u201cinvestment securities,\u201d and the Company may face regulation under the Securities Act or the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d). Such regulation or the inability to meet the requirements to continue operations would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe further development and acceptance of digital asset networks and other digital assets, which represent a new and rapidly changing industry, are subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate, and the slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of digital asset systems may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDigital assets such as bitcoins, which may be used, among other things, to buy and sell goods and services are a new and rapidly evolving industry of which the digital asset networks are prominent, but not unique, parts. The growth of the digital asset industry in general, and the digital asset networks of bitcoin in particular, are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The factors affecting the further development of the digital asset industry, as well as the digital asset networks, include, among others:\n\u25cf continued worldwide growth in the adoption and use of bitcoins and other digital assets;\n\u25cf government and quasi-government regulation of bitcoins and other digital assets and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of the digital asset network or similar digital assets systems;\n\u25cf the maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of the bitcoin network;\n\u25cf changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;\n\u25cf the availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services, including new means of using fiat currencies;\n\u25cf general economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to digital assets; and\n\u25cf the impact of regulators focusing on digital assets and digital securities and the costs associated with such regulatory oversight.\nA decline in the popularity or acceptance of the digital asset networks of bitcoin, or similar digital asset systems, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf demand for transactions in bitcoin declines and is replaced by new demand for other cryptocurrencies, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nTeraWulf\u2019s business is highly dependent on strong bitcoin demand relative to other cryptocurrencies in the market. As such, in addition to the factors impacting the broader crypto economy described elsewhere in this section, the Company\u2019s business may be adversely affected, and growth in TeraWulf\u2019s, and therefore the Company\u2019s, revenues may slow or decline, if market demand for bitcoin deteriorates and is supplanted by other cryptocurrencies such as ethereum and dogecoin. In addition, negative perceptions surrounding bitcoin relative to other cryptocurrencies may cause bitcoin to fall out of favor. If other cryptocurrencies, such as ethereum and dogecoin, surpass bitcoin in market demand over a sustained period of time, such a trend could harm the Company\u2019s business. Competition from public and central bank backed digital currencies could undercut the need for other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Competition from stablecoins (commodity-backed or fiat-backed) could undercut demand for other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.\nSignificant contributors to all or any digital asset network could propose amendments to the respective network\u2019s protocols and software that, if accepted and authorized by such network, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDigital asset networks are open-source projects and, although there is an influential group of leaders in, for example, the bitcoin network community known as the \u201cCore Developers,\u201d there is no official developer or group of developers that formally controls the bitcoin network. Any individual can download the bitcoin network software and make any desired modifications, which are proposed to users and miners on the bitcoin network through software downloads and upgrades, typically posted to the bitcoin development forum on GitHub.com. Proposals for upgrades and discussions relating thereto take place on online forums. For example, there is an ongoing debate regarding altering the blockchain by increasing the size of blocks to accommodate a larger volume of transactions. Although some proponents support an increase, other market participants oppose an increase to the block size as it may deter miners from confirming transactions and concentrate power into a smaller group of miners. To the extent that a significant majority of the users and miners on the bitcoin network install such software upgrade, the bitcoin network would be subject to new protocols and software that may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the event a developer or group of developers proposes a modification to the bitcoin network that is not accepted by a majority of miners and users, but that is nonetheless accepted by a substantial plurality of miners and users, two or more competing and incompatible blockchain implementations could result. This is known as a \u201chard fork.\u201d We may not be able to realize the economic benefit of such a \u201chard fork\u201d, either immediately or ever, which could adversely affect an investment in our securities. If we hold a cryptocurrency at the time of a hard fork, industry standards would dictate that we would be expected to hold an equivalent amount of the old and new assets following the fork. However, we may not be able, or it may not be practical, to secure or realize the economic benefit of the new asset for various reasons. For instance, we may determine that there is no safe or practical way to custody the new asset, that trying to do so may pose an unacceptable risk to our holdings in the old asset, or that the costs of taking possession and/or maintaining ownership of the new cryptocurrency exceed the benefits of owning the new cryptocurrency. Additionally, laws, regulation or other factors may prevent us from benefitting from the new asset even if there is a safe and practical way to custody and secure the new asset. In such case, the \u201chard fork\u201d in the blockchain could materially and adversely affect the perceived value of digital assets as reflected on one or both incompatible blockchains, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations and, in the worst-case scenario, harm the sustainability of the bitcoin network\u2019s economy.\nThe open-source structure of the bitcoin network protocol means that the contributors to the protocol are generally not directly compensated for their contributions in maintaining and developing the bitcoin network protocol, and a failure to properly monitor and upgrade the protocol could damage the bitcoin network and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe bitcoin network operates based on an open-source protocol, not represented by an official organization or authority. Instead, it is maintained by a group of core contributors, largely on the Bitcoin Core project on GitHub. As an open-source project, bitcoin is not represented by an official organization or authority. As the bitcoin network protocol is not sold and its use does not generate revenues for contributors, contributors are generally not directly compensated for maintaining and developing the bitcoin network protocol. Although the Media Lab\u2019s Digital Currency Initiative of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology funds the current maintainer Wladimir J. van der Laan, among others, this type of financial incentive is not typical. The lack of guaranteed financial incentive for contributors to maintain or develop the bitcoin network and the lack of guaranteed resources to adequately address emerging issues with the bitcoin network may reduce incentives to address the issues adequately or in a timely manner.\nChanges to a digital asset network which the Company is mining on may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf a malicious actor or botnet obtains control in excess of 50% of the processing power active on any digital asset network, including the bitcoin network, it is possible that such actor or botnet could manipulate the blockchain in a manner that may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf a malicious actor or botnet (a volunteer or hacked collection of computers controlled by networked software coordinating the actions of the computers) obtains a majority of the processing power dedicated to mining on any digital asset network, including the bitcoin network, it may be able to alter the blockchain by constructing alternate blocks if it is able to solve for such blocks faster than the remainder of the miners on the blockchain can add valid blocks. In such alternate blocks, the malicious actor or botnet could control, exclude or modify the ordering of transactions, though it could not generate new digital assets or transactions using such control. Using alternate blocks, the malicious actor could \u201cdouble-spend\u201d its own digital assets (i.e., spend the same digital assets in more than one transaction) and prevent the confirmation of other users\u2019 transactions for so long as it maintains control. To the extent that such malicious actor or botnet does not yield its majority control of the processing power or the digital asset community does not reject the fraudulent blocks as malicious, reversing any changes made to the blockchain may not be possible, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe approach towards and possible crossing of the 50% threshold indicate a greater risk that a single mining pool could exert authority over the validation of digital asset transactions. To the extent that the digital assets ecosystems do not act to ensure greater decentralization of digital asset mining processing power, the feasibility of a malicious actor obtaining in excess of 50% of the processing power on any digital asset network (e.g., through control of a large mining pool or through hacking such a mining pool) will increase, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the award of digital assets for solving blocks and transaction fees for recording transactions are not sufficiently high to cover expenses related to running data center operations, it may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBitcoin miners record transactions when they solve for and add blocks of information to the blockchain. When a miner solves for a block, it creates such block, which includes data relating to (i) the solution to the block, (ii) a reference to the prior block in the blockchain to which the new block is being added and (iii) all transactions that have occurred but have not yet been added to the blockchain. The miner becomes aware of outstanding, unrecorded transactions through data packet transmission and propagation. Typically, bitcoin transactions will be recorded in the next chronological block if the spending party has an internet connection and at least one minute has passed between the transaction\u2019s data packet transmission and the solution of the next block. If a transaction is not recorded in the next chronological block, it is usually recorded in the next block thereafter.\nAs the award of new digital assets for solving blocks declines, and if transaction fees are not sufficiently high, miners may not have an adequate incentive to continue mining and may cease their mining operations. For example, the current fixed reward on the bitcoin network for solving a new block is six and a quarter (6.25) bitcoins per block. The reward decreased from twelve and a half (12.5) bitcoins in May 2020. It is estimated that it will halve again in approximately June 2024. This reduction may result in a reduction in the aggregate hashrate of the bitcoin network as the incentive for miners will decrease. Moreover, miners ceasing operations would reduce the aggregate hashrate on the bitcoin network, which would adversely affect the confirmation process for transactions (i.e., temporarily decreasing the speed at which blocks are added to the blockchain until the next scheduled adjustment in difficulty for block solutions) and make the bitcoin network more vulnerable to a malicious actor obtaining control in excess of 50% of the aggregate hashrate on the bitcoin network. Periodically, the bitcoin network has adjusted the difficulty for block solutions so that solution speeds remain in the vicinity of the expected ten-minute confirmation time targeted by the bitcoin network protocol.\nThe Company believes that from time to time there will be further considerations and adjustments to the bitcoin network and others regarding the difficulty for block solutions. More significant reductions in aggregate hashrate on digital asset networks could result in material, though temporary, delays in block solution confirmation time. Any reduction in confidence in the confirmation process or aggregate hashrate of any digital asset network may negatively impact the value of digital assets, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo the extent that the profit margins of digital asset mining operations are not high, operators of digital asset mining operations are more likely to immediately sell their digital assets earned by mining in the digital asset exchange market, resulting in a reduction in the price of digital assets that may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOver the past eight years, digital asset mining operations have evolved from individual users mining with computer processors, graphics processing units and first-generation servers. Currently, new processing power brought onto the digital asset networks is predominantly added by incorporated and unincorporated \u201cprofessionalized\u201d mining operations. Professionalized mining operations may use proprietary hardware or sophisticated machines. They require the investment of significant capital for the acquisition of this hardware, the leasing of operating space (often in data centers or warehousing facilities), incurrence of electricity costs and the employment of technicians to operate the mining farms. As a result, professionalized mining operations are of a greater scale than prior miners and have more defined, regular expenses and liabilities. These regular expenses and liabilities require professionalized mining operations to more immediately sell digital assets earned from mining operations on the digital asset exchange market, whereas it is believed that individual miners in past years were more likely to hold newly mined digital assets for more extended periods. The immediate selling of newly mined digital assets greatly increases the supply of digital assets on the digital asset exchange market, creating downward pressure on the price of each digital asset.\nThe extent to which the value of digital assets mined by a professionalized mining operation exceeds the allocable capital and operating costs determines the profit margin of such operation. A professionalized mining operation may be more likely to sell a higher percentage of its newly mined digital assets rapidly if it is operating at a low profit margin and it may partially or completely cease operations if its profit margin is negative. This could create a network effect that may further reduce the price of digital assets until mining operations with higher operating costs become unprofitable and remove mining power from the respective digital asset network. The network effect of reduced profit margins resulting in greater sales of newly mined digital assets could result in a reduction in the price of digital assets that may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo the extent that any miners cease to record transactions in solved blocks, transactions that do not include the payment of a transaction fee will not be recorded on the blockchain until a block is solved by a miner who does not require the payment of transaction fees, and any widespread delays in the recording of transactions could result in a loss of confidence in that digital asset network, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo the extent that any miners cease to record transaction in solved blocks, such transactions will not be recorded on the blockchain. Currently, there are no known incentives for miners to elect to exclude the recording of transactions in solved blocks. However, to the extent that any such incentives arise (e.g., a collective movement among miners or one or more mining pools forcing bitcoin users to pay transaction fees as a substitute for or in addition to the award of new bitcoins upon the solving of a block), actions of miners solving a significant number of blocks could delay the recording and confirmation of transactions on the blockchain. Any systemic delays in the recording and confirmation of transactions on the blockchain could result in greater exposure to double-spending transactions, or transactions that consist of bad actors simultaneously sending two or more bitcoin to different addresses, and a loss of confidence in certain or all digital asset networks, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIntellectual property rights claims may adversely affect the operation of some or all digital asset networks.\nThird parties may assert intellectual property claims relating to the holding and transfer of digital assets and their source code. Regardless of the merit of any intellectual property or other legal action, any threatened action that reduces confidence in some or all digital asset networks\u2019 long-term viability or the ability of end-users to hold and transfer digital assets may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a meritorious intellectual property claim could prevent the Company and other end-users from accessing some or all digital asset networks or holding or transferring their digital assets. As a result, an intellectual property claim against the Company or other large digital asset network participants may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo the extent that the digital asset exchanges representing a substantial portion of the volume in digital asset trading are involved in fraud or experience security failures or other operational issues, such digital asset exchanges\u2019 failures may result in a reduction in the price of some or all digital assets and may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe digital asset exchanges on which the digital assets trade are new and, in most cases, largely unregulated. Furthermore, many digital asset exchanges (including several of the most prominent U.S. dollar denominated digital asset exchanges) do not provide the public with significant information regarding their ownership structure, management teams, corporate practices or regulatory compliance. As a result, the marketplace may lose confidence in, or may experience problems relating to, digital asset exchanges, including prominent exchanges handling a significant portion of the volume of digital asset trading. A lack of stability in the digital asset exchange market and the closure or temporary shutdown of digital asset exchanges due to fraud, business failure, hackers or malware or government-mandated regulation may reduce confidence in the digital asset networks and result in greater volatility in digital asset values. These potential consequences of a digital asset exchange\u2019s failure may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPolitical or economic crises may motivate large-scale sales of digital assets, which could result in a reduction in some or all digital assets\u2019 values and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs an alternative to fiat currencies that are backed by central governments, digital assets such as bitcoins, which are relatively new, are subject to supply and demand forces based upon the desirability of an alternative, decentralized means of buying and selling goods and services, and it is unclear how such supply and demand will be impacted by geopolitical events. Nevertheless, political or economic crises, including current or anticipated military conflicts such as the war between Russia and Ukraine, terrorism, sanctions or other geopolitical events globally, may motivate large-scale acquisitions or sales of digital assets either globally or locally. Large-scale sales of digital assets would result in a reduction in some or all digital assets\u2019 values and may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to adopt technology in response to changing security needs or trends poses a challenge to the safekeeping of the Company\u2019s digital assets.\nThe history of digital asset exchanges has shown that exchanges and large holders of digital assets must adapt to technological change in order to secure and safeguard their digital assets. The Company will rely on enterprise cold storage solutions from third parties to safeguard the Company\u2019s digital assets from theft, loss, destruction or other issues relating to hackers and technological attack. The Company\u2019s digital assets may also be moved to various exchanges in order to exchange them for fiat currency during which time the Company will be relying on the security of such exchanges to safeguard the Company\u2019s digital assets.\nThe Company believes that it may become a more appealing target of security threats as the size of the Company\u2019s bitcoin holdings grow. To the extent that either custody providers or the Company are unable to identify and mitigate or stop new security threats, the Company\u2019s digital assets may be subject to theft, loss, destruction or other attack, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDigital asset transactions are irrevocable, and stolen or incorrectly transferred digital assets may be irretrievable and, as a result, any incorrectly executed digital asset transactions may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDigital asset transactions are not, from an administrative perspective, reversible without the consent and active participation of the recipient of the transaction or, in theory, control or consent of a majority of the processing power on the respective digital asset network. Once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to the blockchain, an incorrect transfer of digital assets or a theft of digital assets generally will not be reversible, and the Company may not be capable of seeking compensation for any such transfer or theft. Although the Company\u2019s transfers of digital assets will regularly be made to or from various parties, it is possible that, through computer or human error, or through theft or criminal action, the Company\u2019s digital assets could be transferred in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties. To the extent that the Company is unable to seek a corrective transaction with such third party or is incapable of identifying the third party which has received the Company\u2019s digital assets through error or theft, the Company will be unable to revert or otherwise recover incorrectly transferred digital assets. To the extent that the Company is unable to seek redress for such error or theft, such loss may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe limited rights of legal recourse against the Company, and the Company\u2019s lack of insurance protection, exposes the Company and its stockholders to the risk of loss of its digital assets for which no person is liable.\nThe digital assets held by the Company may not be insured. Therefore, a loss may be suffered with respect to the Company\u2019s digital assets which is not covered by insurance and for which no person is liable in damages, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company may not have adequate sources of recovery if its digital assets are lost, stolen or destroyed.\nIf the Company\u2019s digital assets are lost, stolen or destroyed under circumstances rendering a party liable to the Company, the responsible party may not have the financial resources sufficient to satisfy its claim. For example, as to a particular event of loss, the only source of recovery for the Company might be limited, to the extent identifiable, other responsible third parties (e.g., a thief or terrorist), any of which may not have the financial resources (including liability insurance coverage) to satisfy a valid claim by the Company.\nDigital assets held by the Company are not subject to FDIC or SIPC protections.\nThe Company does not hold its digital assets with a banking institution or a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) or the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (\u201cSIPC\u201d) and, therefore, its digital assets are not subject to the protections enjoyed by depositors with FDIC or SIPC member institutions.\nThe loss or destruction of a private key required to access a digital asset may be irreversible and, as a result, the Company\u2019s loss of access to its private keys or its experience of a data loss relating to its digital assets may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDigital assets are controllable only by the possessor of both the unique public key and private key relating to the local or online digital wallet in which the digital assets are held. The Company is required by the operation of digital asset networks to publish the public key relating to a digital wallet in use when it first verifies a spending transaction from that digital wallet and disseminates such information into the respective network. The Company safeguards and keeps private the private keys relating to its digital assets by using enterprise cold storage custody solutions from third parties. To the extent a private key is lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised and no backup of the private key is accessible, the Company will be unable to access the digital assets held by it and the private key will not be capable of being restored by the respective digital asset network. Any loss of private keys relating to digital wallets used to store the Company\u2019s digital assets may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause many of the Company\u2019s digital assets are held by digital asset exchanges, it faces heightened risks from cybersecurity attacks and financial stability of digital asset exchanges.\nThe Company may transfer digital asset from its wallet to digital asset exchanges prior to selling them. Digital assets not held in the Company\u2019s wallet are subject to the risks encountered by digital asset exchanges including a denial-of-service attack or other malicious hacking, a sale of the digital asset exchange, loss of the digital assets by the digital asset exchange and other risks similar to those described herein. The Company may not maintain a custodian agreement with any of the digital asset exchanges that hold the Company\u2019s digital assets. These digital asset exchanges may or may not provide insurance and may lack the resources to protect against hacking and theft. If this were to occur, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nAs the number of digital assets awarded for solving a block in the blockchain decreases, the incentive for miners to continue to contribute processing power to the respective digital asset network will transition from a set reward to transaction fees.\nIn order to incentivize miners to continue to contribute processing power to any digital asset network, such network may either formally or informally transition from a set reward to transaction fees earned upon solving for a block. This transition could be accomplished either by miners independently electing to record in the blocks they solve only those transactions that include payment of a transaction fee or by the digital asset network adopting software upgrades that require the payment of a minimum transaction fee for all transactions. If transaction fees paid for digital asset transactions become too high, the marketplace may be reluctant to accept digital assets as a means of payment and existing users may be motivated to switch from one digital asset to another digital asset or back to fiat currency. Decreased use and demand for bitcoins may adversely affect the value of the Company\u2019s bitcoins and may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe price of bitcoin may be influenced by regulatory, commercial and technical factors that are highly uncertain resulting in the price of bitcoin being extremely volatile, which may significantly influence the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nTo the extent investors view the value of the Company\u2019s common stock as linked to the value or change in the value of bitcoin, fluctuations in the price of bitcoin may significantly influence the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock. In addition, the Company\u2019s business operations are no longer economical below the bitcoin breakeven point, or the point at which the total cost of mining operations exceeds the total revenues generated.\nThe price of bitcoin has historically been subject to dramatic fluctuations and is highly volatile. Bitcoin has only recently become accepted as a means of payment for goods and services and has recently trended toward becoming a more actively traded instrument, however the acceptance and use of bitcoin remains limited and far from mainstream. Conversely, a significant portion of demand for bitcoin may be generated by speculators and investors seeking to profit from the short- or long-term holding of bitcoin.\nIn addition, some blockchain industry participants have reported that a significant percentage of bitcoin trading activity is artificial or non-economic in nature and may represent attempts to manipulate the price of bitcoin. As a result, trading platforms may seek to inflate demand for bitcoin, which could increase the volatility of the price of bitcoin and may significantly influence the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe sale of the Company\u2019s digital assets to pay expenses at a time of low digital asset prices may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company may sell its digital assets to pay expenses on an as-needed basis, irrespective of then-current prices. Consequently, the Company\u2019s digital assets may be sold at a time when the prices on the respective digital asset exchange market are low, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe development and acceptance of competing blockchain platforms or technologies may cause consumers to use alternative distributed ledgers or other alternatives.\nThe development and acceptance of competing blockchain platforms or technologies, including competing cryptocurrencies which our miners may not be able to mine, such as cryptocurrencies being developed by popular social media platforms, online retailers, or government sponsored cryptocurrencies, may cause consumers to use alternative distributed ledgers or an alternative to distributed ledgers altogether. Our business utilizes presently existent digital ledgers and blockchains and we could face difficulty adapting to emergent digital ledgers, blockchains, or alternatives thereto. This may adversely affect us and our exposure to various blockchain technologies and prevent us from realizing the anticipated profits from our investments. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, which could materially and adversely affect investors\u2019 investments in our securities.\nThe decentralized nature of cryptocurrency systems may lead to slow or inadequate responses to crises, which may negatively affect our business.\nThe decentralized nature of the governance of cryptocurrency systems may lead to ineffective decision making that slows development or prevents a network from overcoming emergent obstacles. Governance of many cryptocurrency systems is by voluntary consensus and open competition with no clear leadership structure or authority. To the extent lack of clarity in corporate governance of cryptocurrency systems leads to ineffective decision making that slows development and growth of such cryptocurrencies, the value of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Regulatory and Political Matters\nThe Company may be classified as an inadvertent investment company.\nThe Company is not engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities and does not hold itself out as being engaged in those activities. Under the Investment Company Act, however, a company may be deemed an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(C) if the value of its investment securities is more than 40% of its total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on a consolidated basis.\nThe Company will be engaging in digital asset mining, the outputs of which are cryptocurrencies, which may be deemed a security. In the event that the digital assets held by the Company exceed 40% of its total assets, exclusive of cash, the Company may inadvertently become an investment company. An inadvertent investment company can avoid being classified as an investment company if it can rely on one of the exclusions under the Investment Company Act. One such exclusion, namely Rule 3a-2 under the Investment Company Act, allows an inadvertent investment company a grace period of one year from the earlier of (i) the date on which an issuer owns securities and/or cash having a value exceeding 50% of the issuer\u2019s total assets on either a consolidated or unconsolidated basis and (ii) the date on which an issuer owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuer\u2019s total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. The Company is putting in place policies that it expects will work to keep the digital assets held by the Company at less than 40% of its total assets, liquidating its digital assets or seeking a no-action letter from the SEC if the Company is unable to maintain sufficient total assets or liquidate sufficient digital assets in a timely manner.\nAs Rule 3a-2 is available to a company no more than once every three years, and assuming no other exclusions are available to the Company, the Company would have to keep within the 40% limit for at least three years after it ceases being an inadvertent investment company. This may limit the Company\u2019s ability to make certain investments or enter into joint ventures that could otherwise have a positive impact on the Company\u2019s earnings. In any event, the Company does not intend to become an investment company engaged in the business of investing and trading securities.\nClassification as an investment company under the Investment Company Act requires registration with the SEC. If an investment company fails to register, it would have to stop doing almost all business, and its contracts would become voidable. Registration is time consuming and restrictive and would require a restructuring of the Company\u2019s operations, and the Company would be very constrained in the kind of business it could do as a registered investment company. Furthermore, the Company would become subject to substantial regulation concerning management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons and portfolio composition, and would need to file reports under the Investment Company Act regime. The cost of such compliance would result in the Company incurring substantial additional expenses, and the failure to register if required may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory changes or actions may restrict the use of bitcoins or the operation of the bitcoin network in a manner that may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUntil recently, little or no regulatory attention has been directed toward bitcoin and the bitcoin network by U.S. federal and state governments, foreign governments and self-regulatory agencies. As bitcoin has grown in popularity and in market size, the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Congress and certain U.S. agencies (e.g., the CFTC, the SEC, FinCEN and the Federal Bureau of Investigation) have begun to examine the operations of the bitcoin network, bitcoin users and the bitcoin exchange market.\nDigital assets currently face an uncertain regulatory landscape in not only the United States but also in many foreign jurisdictions, such as the European Union, China and Russia. As bitcoin and cryptocurrencies generally have grown in both popularity and market size, governments around the world have reacted differently to them with certain governments having deemed them illegal and others having allowed their use and trade without restriction. Based on stated efforts to curtail energy usage on mining, to protect investors or to prevent criminal activity, and in part to redirect interest into competing government-created cryptocurrencies, recent regulations have proliferated. In March 2021, a new law was proposed in India to criminalize the mining, transferring or holding of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and current rules require extensive disclosure to the government of cryptocurrency holdings. At the same time, India is rumored to be developing its own centralized national digital currency. Similarly, China has also limited some mining and trading, although not possession, of cryptocurrency, ostensibly to reduce energy usage in a country formerly representing an estimated 65% of bitcoin mining, but reports suggest such regulation is also designed, in part, to drive appetite for China\u2019s own digital yuan. In the summer of 2021, China introduced a cryptocurrency mining ban. Due to China\u2019s cryptocurrency mining ban, the Chinese hashrate is expected to approach zero, with mining capacity relocating out of China. On April 16, 2021, Turkey imposed bans on the use of cryptocurrency as payment and now requires transactions of a certain size to be reported to a government agency in the wake of alleged fraud at one of Turkey\u2019s largest exchanges. In addition, in May 2021, Iran announced a temporary ban on cryptocurrency mining as a way to reduce energy consumption amid power blackouts. In Germany, the Ministry of Finance has declared bitcoin to be \u201cRechnungseinheiten\u201d (a form of private money that is recognized as a unit of account, but not recognized in the same manner as fiat currency). Many jurisdictions, such as the United States, subject bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to extensive, and in some cases overlapping, unclear and evolving regulatory requirements. Further, in January 2021, Russia adopted legislation to identify cryptocurrency as a digital asset and legitimize its trading, but also prohibit its use as a payment method, with mining operations having also grown significantly in Russia since this time. Such varying government regulations and pronouncements are likely to continue for the near future.\nIn the United States, the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Congress and certain U.S. agencies (e.g., the CFTC, the SEC, FinCEN and the Federal Bureau of Investigation) have begun to examine the operations of the bitcoin network, bitcoin users and the bitcoin exchange market. Increasing regulation and regulatory scrutiny may result in new costs for the Company and the Company management having to devote increased time and attention to regulatory matters, change aspects of its business or result in limits on the utility of bitcoin. In addition, regulatory developments and/or the Company\u2019s business activities may require the Company to comply with certain regulatory regimes.\nOngoing and future regulation and regulatory actions could significantly restrict or eliminate the market for or uses of bitcoin and/or may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIt may be illegal now, or in the future, to acquire, own, hold, sell or use digital assets in one or more countries, and ownership of, holding or trading in the Company\u2019s securities may also be considered illegal and subject to sanction.\nAlthough digital assets are not currently regulated or are lightly regulated in most countries, including the United States, one or more countries, such as China and Russia, may take regulatory actions in the future that severely restricts the right to acquire, own, hold, sell or use digital assets or to exchange digital assets for fiat currency. Such an action may also result in the restriction of ownership, holding or trading in the Company\u2019s securities and may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf regulatory changes or interpretations of the Company\u2019s activities require its registration as a money services business under the regulations promulgated by FinCEN under the authority of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended, the Company may be required to register and comply with such regulations.\nTo the extent that the activities of the Company cause it to be deemed a money service business under the regulations promulgated by FinCEN under the authority of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended, the Company may be required to comply with FinCEN regulations, including those that would mandate the Company to implement anti-money laundering programs, make certain reports to FinCEN and maintain certain records.\nTo the extent that the activities of the Company cause it to be deemed a \u201cmoney transmitter\u201d or equivalent designation under state law of any state in which the Company operates, the Company may be required to seek a license or otherwise register with a state regulator and comply with state regulations that may include the implementation of anti-money laundering programs, maintenance of certain records and other operational requirements. Currently, the New York State Department of Financial Services has finalized its \u201cBitLicense\u201d framework for businesses that conduct \u201cvirtual currency business activity,\u201d the Conference of State Bank Supervisors has proposed a model form of state level \u201cvirtual currency\u201d regulation and additional state regulators, including those from the States of California, Idaho, Virginia, Kansas, Texas, South Dakota and Washington, have made public statements indicating that virtual currency businesses may be required to seek licenses as money transmitters. In July 2016, the State of North Carolina updated the law to define \u201cvirtual currency\u201d and the activities that trigger licensure in a business-friendly approach that encourages companies to use virtual currency and blockchain technology. Specifically, the North Carolina law does not require miners or software providers to obtain a license for multi-signature software, smart contract platforms, smart property, colored coins and non-hosted, non-custodial wallets. Starting on January 1, 2016, the State of New Hampshire requires anyone who exchanges a digital currency for another currency must become a licensed and bonded money transmitter. In numerous other states, including the States of Connecticut and New Jersey, legislation is being proposed or has been introduced regarding the treatment of bitcoin and other digital assets. The Company will continue to monitor for developments in such legislation, guidance or regulations.\nSuch additional federal or state regulatory obligations may cause the Company to incur extraordinary expenses, possibly affecting an investment in the shares of the Company\u2019s common stock in a material and adverse manner. Furthermore, the Company and its service providers may not be capable of complying with certain federal or state regulatory obligations applicable to money services business and money transmitters. If the Company is deemed to be subject to and is determined not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, the Company may act to dissolve and liquidate the Company.\nBlockchain technology may expose the Company to specially designated nationals or blocked persons or cause it to violate provisions of law.\nThe Company is subject to the rules enforced by The Office of Financial Assets Control of the U.S. Department of Treasury (\u201cOFAC\u201d), including regarding sanctions and requirements not to conduct business with persons named on its specially designated nationals list. However, because of the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions, the Company may inadvertently and without its knowledge engage in transactions with persons named on OFAC\u2019s specially designated nationals list, which may expose the Company to regulatory sanctions and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company may be required to register and comply with bitcoin regulations and, to the extent that the Company decides to continue operations, the required registrations and regulatory compliance steps may result in extraordinary expenses to the Company.\nCurrent and future legislation, and other regulatory developments, including interpretations released by a regulatory authority, may impact the manner in which bitcoins are treated for classification and clearing purposes. In particular, bitcoin derivatives are not excluded from the definition of \u201ccommodity future\u201d by the CFTC. The Company cannot be certain as to how future regulatory developments will impact the treatment of bitcoins under the law.\nBitcoins have been deemed to fall within the definition of a commodity, and the Company may be required to register and comply with additional regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, as amended, including additional periodic report and disclosure standards and requirements. Moreover, the Company may be required to register as a commodity pool operator and to register us as a commodity pool with the CFTC through the National Futures Association. Such additional registrations may result in extraordinary expenses, thereby materially and adversely affecting the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. If the Company determines it will not comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, it may seek to cease certain of its operations. Any such action may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. As of the date of this Annual Report, the Company is not aware of any rules that have been proposed to regulate bitcoins as securities. However, the Company cannot be certain as to how future regulatory developments will impact the treatment of bitcoins under the law.\nIf federal or state legislatures or agencies initiate or release tax determinations that change the classification of bitcoins as property for tax purposes (in the context of when such bitcoins are held as an investment), such determination could have a negative tax consequence on the Company or its shareholders.\nCurrent guidance from the Internal Revenue Service indicates that digital assets such as bitcoin should be treated and taxed as property and that transactions involving the payment of bitcoin for goods and services should be treated as barter transactions. While this treatment creates a potential tax reporting requirement for any circumstance where the ownership of a bitcoin passes from one person to another, usually by means of bitcoin transactions (including off-blockchain transactions), it would also apply capital gains treatment to those transactions which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnder certain recently proposed legislation, substantial tax compliance burdens may be imposed on the Company relating to the tax reporting of bitcoin and bitcoin-related transactions.\nLegislation recently passed in the Senate would impose substantial tax compliance obligations on the Company relating to the reporting of bitcoin and bitcoin-related transactions. Under this legislation, it is possible that the Company would be treated as a digital assets broker and required to deliver certain tax forms in connection with the validation of blockchain transactions. Were this legislation to be passed in the\nHouse and enacted unchanged, the Company could face tax reporting and compliance mandates that it may not have the information or resources to fully comply with. Although the current legislation may not be enacted in its current form, future legislation may impose similar tax compliance responsibilities on the Company, which may be expensive and burdensome to comply with, and which could, as a result, adversely impact the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company\u2019s bitcoin holdings could subject it to regulatory scrutiny.\nSeveral bitcoin investment vehicles have attempted to list their shares on a U.S. national securities exchange to permit them to function in the manner of an exchange-traded fund with continuous share creation and redemption at net asset value. To date the SEC has declined to approve any such listing, citing concerns over the surveillance of trading in markets for the underlying bitcoin as well as concerns about fraud and manipulation in bitcoin trading markets. Even though the Company does not function in the manner of an exchange-traded fund and does not offer continuous share creation and redemption at net asset value, it is possible that the Company nevertheless could face regulatory scrutiny from the SEC, as a company with securities traded on Nasdaq.\nIn addition, as digital assets, including bitcoin, have grown in popularity and market size, there has been increasing focus on the extent to which digital assets can be used to launder the proceeds of illegal activities or fund criminal or terrorist activities or entities subject to sanctions regimes. While the Company maintains risk-based procedures reasonably designed to promote compliance with applicable anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and regulations and takes care to only acquire bitcoin through entities subject to anti money laundering regulation and related compliance rules in the United States, if it is found to have purchased any bitcoin from bad actors that have used bitcoin to launder money or persons subject to sanctions, the Company is and may continue to be subject to regulatory proceedings and further transactions or dealings in bitcoin may be restricted or prohibited.\nDue to the unregulated nature and lack of transparency surrounding the operations of many bitcoin trading venues, they may experience fraud, security failures or operational problems, which may adversely affect the value of the Company\u2019s bitcoin holdings.\nBitcoin trading venues are relatively new and, in some cases, unregulated. Furthermore, there are many bitcoin trading venues which do not provide the public with significant information regarding their ownership structure, management teams, corporate practices and regulatory compliance. As a result, the marketplace may lose confidence in bitcoin trading venues, including prominent exchanges that handle a significant volume of bitcoin trading.\nNegative perception, a lack of stability in the broader bitcoin markets and the closure or temporary shutdown of bitcoin trading venues due to fraud, business failure, hackers or malware or government- mandated regulation may reduce confidence in bitcoin and result in greater volatility in the prices of bitcoin.\nTo the extent investors view the Company\u2019s common stock as linked to the value of the Company\u2019s bitcoin holdings, these potential consequences of a bitcoin trading venue\u2019s failure could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nIn the past, we have not paid dividends on our common stock. We do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and we intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of certain existing and any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock may be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nMarket price of our common stock may be volatile, which could subject us to securities class action litigation and result in substantial losses for our stockholders.\nThe market price of shares of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section and the documents incorporated by reference in this Annual Report as well as other factors others beyond our control. Furthermore, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of shares of our common stock. In addition, such fluctuations could subject us to securities class action litigation, which could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could potentially harm our business. As a result of this volatility, our stockholders may not be able to sell their shares of our common stock at or above the price at which they purchased their shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 87759, "SIC": 2840, "TIC": "IKNX"}
