Risk Factors\nIn the execution of our business strategy, our operations and financial condition are subject to certain risks. A summary of certain material risks is provided below, and you should take such risks into account in evaluating any investment decision involving the Company. This section does not describe all risks applicable to us and is intended only as a summary of certain material factors that could impact our operations in the industry in which we operate. Other sections of this report contain additional information concerning these and other risks.\nRisks Relating to Our Business Generally\nOur business strategy relating to the development and introduction of new products and services exposes us to risks such as limited customer and/or market acceptance and additional expenditures that may not result in additional net revenue.\nAn important component of our business strategy is to focus on new products and services that enable us to provide immediate value to our customers. Customer and/or market acceptance of these new products and services cannot be predicted with certainty, and if we fail to execute properly on this strategy or to adapt this strategy as market conditions evolve, our ability to grow revenue and our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to successfully implement our business strategy, our financial performance and our growth could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon our ability to implement our business strategy successfully. Implementation of our strategy will require effective management of our operational, financial and human resources and will place significant demands on those resources. See Part I, Item 2. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Business Strategy\" in this report for more information regarding our business strategy. There are risks involved in pursuing our strategy, including the ability to hire or retain the personnel necessary to manage our strategy effectively.\nIn addition to the risks set forth above, implementation of our business strategy could be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, such as increased competition, legal developments, government regulation, general economic conditions, increased operating costs or expenses, and changes in industry trends. We may decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time. If we are not able to implement our business strategy successfully, our long-term growth and profitability may be adversely affected. Even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business strategy successfully, our operating results may not improve to the extent we anticipate, or at all.\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition of Nutrisystem, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nThe ultimate success of the acquisition of Nutrisystem will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated\nbenefits and cost savings from combining the business of Nutrisystem with our legacy business. Our ability to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings is subject to certain risks including:\n\u2022\nour ability to combine successfully the business of Nutrisystem with our legacy business, including with respect to the integration of our systems and technology;\n\u2022\nwhether the combined businesses will perform as currently expected;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we paid more for Nutrisystem than the value we will derive from the acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe reduction of our cash available for operations and other uses and the incurrence of indebtedness to finance the acquisition; and\n\u2022\nthe assumption of known and unknown liabilities of Nutrisystem.\nIf we are not able to successfully combine the business of Nutrisystem with our legacy business within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected, the combined businesses may not perform as expected, and the value of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nWe cannot provide assurances that Nutrisystem\u2019s business and our legacy business can be integrated successfully. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of our ongoing businesses or in unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs, and an overall integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated.\nIn addition, at times, the attention of certain members of our management and resources may be focused on completion of the integration and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt our ongoing business.\nWe may experience difficulties associated with the implementation and/or integration of new businesses, services (including outsourced services), technologies, solutions, or products.\nWe may face difficulties, costs, and delays in effectively implementing and/or integrating acquired businesses, services (including outsourced services), technologies, solutions, or products into our business. Implementing internally-developed solutions and products, and/or integrating newly acquired businesses, services (including outsourced services), and technologies could be time-consuming and may strain our resources. Consequently, we may not be successful in implementing and/or integrating these new businesses, services, technologies, solutions, or products and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits.\nThe performance of our business and the level of our indebtedness could prevent us from meeting the obligations under our Credit Agreement or have an adverse effect on our future financial condition, our ability to raise additional capital, or our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.\nIn connection with the consummation of the acquisition of Nutrisystem, on March 8, 2019, we entered into a new Credit and Guaranty Agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with a group of lenders, Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch (\"Credit Suisse\"), as general administrative agent, term facility agent and collateral agent, and SunTrust Bank (\u201cSunTrust\u201d), as revolving facility agent and swing line lender. As of December 31, 2019, outstanding debt under the Credit Agreement was $1,048 million.\nOur ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs.\nThe Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain specified maximum ratios or levels of consolidated total net debt to EBITDA, calculated as provided in the Credit Agreement. Our failure to comply with such covenant could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or debt service capability. The Credit Agreement also contains various other affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type that, subject to certain exceptions, impose restrictions and limitations on us and certain of our subsidiaries with respect to, among other things, indebtedness; liens; negative pledges; restricted payments (including dividends, distributions, buybacks, redemptions, repurchases with respect to equity interests, and payments, redemptions, retirements, purchases, acquisitions, defeasance, exchange, conversion, cancellation or termination with respect to junior lien, subordinated\nor unsecured debt); restrictions on subsidiary distributions; loans, advances, guarantees, acquisitions and other investments; mergers and other fundamental changes; sales and other dispositions of assets (including equity interests in subsidiaries); sale/leaseback transactions; transactions with affiliates; conduct of business; amendments and waivers of organizational documents and material junior debt agreements; and changes to fiscal year.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our future financial condition or our ability to react to changes in the economy or industry by, among other things:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions, loss of revenue and/or profit margins in our business, or to increases in interest rates, particularly with respect to the portion of our outstanding debt that is subject to variable interest rates;\n\u2022\npotentially limiting our ability to obtain additional financing or to obtain such financing on favorable terms;\ncausing us to dedicate a portion of future cash flow from operations to service or pay down our debt, which reduces the cash available for other purposes, such as operations, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities; and\npossibly limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be less leveraged.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly, and changes in LIBOR reporting practices could lead to an increase in the cost of our indebtedness and adversely affect our results of operations.\nBorrowings under our Credit Agreement are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. Interest rates are currently at historically low levels, but if interest rates increase, our debt service obligations with respect to our variable rate indebtedness would increase even if the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows would correspondingly decrease.\nTo mitigate our exposure to future interest rate volatility with respect to our variable rate indebtedness, we have entered into interest rate swaps and may in the future enter into additional interest rate swaps, which involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments. Considering hedging gains and losses and cash settlement costs, we may not elect to maintain such interest rate swaps, and any swaps may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.\nIn addition, a transition away from LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate may adversely affect our variable rate debt and interest rate swaps. The Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom has announced that by the end of calendar year 2021 it will no longer require LIBOR submissions, resulting in the possible unavailability or lack of suitability of LIBOR as a benchmark rate. While our borrowing arrangements provide for alternative base rates as well as a method for selecting a benchmark replacement for LIBOR, the consequences of the possibility of LIBOR becoming unavailable or not suitable cannot be entirely predicted at this time. Use of an alternative base rate or a benchmark replacement for LIBOR as a basis for calculating interest with respect to our outstanding variable rate indebtedness or interest rate swap agreements could lead to an increase in the interest we pay and a corresponding increase in the cost of such indebtedness, and could affect our ability to refinance some or all of our existing indebtedness or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in macroeconomic conditions may adversely affect our business.\nEconomic difficulties and other macroeconomic conditions could reduce the demand and/or the timing of purchases for certain of our services from customers and potential customers. In addition, changes in economic conditions could create liquidity and credit constraints. We cannot assure you that we would be able to secure additional financing if needed and, if such funds were available, that the terms and conditions would be acceptable to us.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets, the value of which could become further impaired.\nWe have recorded significant portions of the purchase price of certain acquisitions as goodwill and/or intangible assets. We review goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment on an annual basis\n(during the fourth quarter) or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded impairment losses of $240.0 million and $137.1 million related to the Nutrisystem tradename and goodwill, respectively, and at December 31, 2019, we had approximately $654.6 million and $689.7 million of goodwill and intangible assets, respectively, remaining. If we determine that the carrying values of our goodwill and/or intangible assets should be further impaired, we may incur additional non-cash charges to earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the period in which the additional impairment occurs.\nA failure of our information technology or systems could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to deliver our products and services depends on effectively using information technology. We rely upon our information technology and systems, employees, and third parties for operating and monitoring all major aspects of our business. These technologies and systems and, therefore, our operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, power loss, network failure, improper operation by our employees, data privacy or security breaches, computer viruses, computer hacking, network penetration or other illegal intrusions or other unexpected events. Any disruption in the operation of our information technology or systems, regardless of the cause, could adversely impact our operations, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA cybersecurity incident could result in the loss of confidential data, give rise to remediation and other expenses, expose us to liability under HIPAA, consumer protection laws, common law theories or other laws, subject us to litigation and federal and state governmental inquiries, damage our reputation, and otherwise be disruptive to our business.\nThe nature of our business involves the receipt, storage and use of personal data about the participants in our programs, including individually identifiable health information, as well as employees and customers. Additionally, we rely upon third parties that are not directly under our control to store and use portions of that personal data as well. The secure maintenance of this and other confidential information or other proprietary information is critical to our business operations. To protect our information systems from attack, damage and unauthorized use, we have implemented multiple layers of security, including technical safeguards, processes, and our people. Our defenses are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties. Despite these efforts, threats from malicious persons and groups, new vulnerabilities, technology failures, and advanced attacks against information systems create risk of cybersecurity incidents. We cannot provide assurance that we or our third-party vendors or other service providers will not be subject to cybersecurity incidents, which may result in unauthorized access by third parties, loss, misappropriation, disclosure or corruption of customer, employee, or our information; member personal health information; or other data subject to privacy laws. Such cybersecurity incidents or delays in responding to or remedying damage caused by such incidents may lead to a disruption in our systems or business, costs to modify, enhance, or remediate our cybersecurity measures, liability under privacy, security and consumer protection laws or litigation under these or other laws, including common law theories, and subject us to enforcement actions, fines, regulatory proceedings or litigation against us, damage to our business reputation, a reduction in participation and sales of our products and services, and legal obligations to notify customers or other affected individuals about an incident, which could cause us to incur substantial costs and negative publicity, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and harm our business reputation.\nAs a result, cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices remain a priority for us. We may be required to expend significant additional resources in our efforts to modify or enhance our protective measures against evolving threats or to investigate and remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities.\nOur business is subject to changing privacy and security laws, rules and regulations, including HIPAA, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and other state privacy regulations, which impact our operating costs and for which failure to adhere could negatively impact our business.\nOur business is subject to various privacy and data security laws, regulations, and codes of conduct that apply to our various business units (e.g., Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards and Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\u201cTCPA\u201d)). These laws and regulations may be inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving and differing (sometimes conflicting) interpretations. While we are using internal and external resources to\nmonitor compliance with and to continue to modify our data processing practices and policies in order to comply with evolving privacy laws, relevant regulatory authorities could determine that our data handling practices fail to address all the requirements of certain new laws, which could subject us to penalties and/or litigation. Government regulators, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data. This increased scrutiny may result in new interpretations of existing laws as well as new laws, regulations, and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, and information security proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions, thereby further impacting our business. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), went into effect on January 1, 2020, and it applies broadly to information that identifies or is associated with any California household or individual, and compliance with the new law requires that we implement several operational changes, including processes to respond to individuals\u2019 data access and deletion requests. Failure to comply with the CCPA may result in attorney general enforcement action and damage to our reputation. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. We may also be exposed to litigation, regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions if the personal, confidential or proprietary information of our customers is mishandled or misused by any of our suppliers, counterparties or other third parties, or if such third-parties do not have appropriate controls in place to protect such personal, confidential or proprietary information. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the collection, use, dissemination and security of data. The obligations imposed by the CCPA and other similar laws that may be enacted at the federal and state level may require us to modify our business practices and policies and to incur substantial expenditures in order to comply.\nIn order to be successful, we must attract, engage, retain and integrate key employees and have adequate succession plans in place, and failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our business.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract, engage, retain and integrate qualified executives and other key employees throughout all areas of our business. Identifying, developing internally or hiring externally, training and retaining highly skilled managerial and other personnel are critical to our future, and competition for experienced employees can be intense. Failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations. The loss of services of any key personnel, the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future, or delays in hiring may harm our business and results of operations. Further, changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business, and any failure to successfully integrate key newly hired employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe face competition for staffing, which may increase our labor costs and reduce profitability.\nWe compete with other healthcare and services providers in recruiting qualified management, including executives with the required skills and experience to operate and grow our business, and staff personnel for the day-to-day operations of our business. These challenges may require us to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain qualified management and other professionals. Difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified management and other professionals, or in controlling labor costs, could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nWe are or may become a party to litigation that could potentially force us to pay significant damages and/or harm our reputation.\nWe are subject to certain legal proceedings, which potentially involve large claims and significant defense costs (see Part II, Item 1. \"Legal Proceedings\" in this report). These legal proceedings and any other claims that we may face in the future, whether with or without merit, could result in costly litigation, and divert the time, attention, and resources of our management. The coverage limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate to cover all such claims and some claims may not be covered by insurance. Additionally, insurance coverage with respect to some claims against us or our directors and officers may not be available on terms that would be favorable to us, or the cost of such coverage could increase in the future. Further, although we believe that we have conducted our operations in compliance with applicable statutory and contractual requirements and that we have meritorious defenses to outstanding claims, it is possible that resolution of these legal matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, legal expenses associated with the defense of these matters may be material to our results of operations in a particular financial reporting period.\nThird parties may infringe on our brands, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, which may\nhave an adverse impact on our business.\nWe currently rely on a combination of trademark and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures to establish and protect our proprietary rights, including our brands. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, the value of our brands, services and products could be diminished and our business may suffer. Our precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. Any legal action that we may bring to protect our brands and other intellectual property could be unsuccessful and expensive and could divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. In addition, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property, especially in Internet-related businesses, are uncertain and evolving. We cannot assure you that these evolving legal standards will sufficiently protect our intellectual property rights in the future.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property rights claims.\nThird parties may make claims against us alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property claims, regardless of merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could significantly divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. In addition, if we were unable to successfully defend against such claims, we may have to pay damages, stop selling the service or product or stop using the software, technology or content found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights, seek a license for the infringing service, product, software, technology or content or develop alternative non-infringing services, products, software, technology or content. If we cannot license on reasonable terms, develop alternatives or stop using the service, product, software, technology or content for any infringing aspects of our business, we may be forced to limit our service and product offerings. Any of these results could reduce our revenue and our ability to compete effectively, increase our costs or harm our business.\nDamage to our reputation could harm our business, including our competitive position and business prospects.\nOur ability to attract and retain customers, members and employees is impacted by our reputation. Harm to our reputation can arise from various sources, including employee misconduct, cyber security breaches, unethical behavior, litigation or regulatory outcomes, which could, among other consequences, increase the size and number of litigation claims and damages asserted or subject us to enforcement actions, fines and penalties and cause us to incur related costs and expenses.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws of other countries in which we provided services prior to the sale of our TPHS business.\nBecause of the international operations that we previously conducted as part of our TPHS business that we sold to Sharecare, Inc. in July 2016, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws of other countries in which we provided services prior to the sale. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining any business advantage. While our policies mandated compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures always protected us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, contractors or agents. Failure to comply with the FCPA and similar legislation prior to the sale of our TPHS business could result in the imposition of civil or criminal fines and penalties and could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Our Healthcare Segment\nA significant percentage of Healthcare segment revenues is derived from health plan customers.\nA significant percentage of our Healthcare segment revenues is derived from health plan customers. The health plan industry may continue to consolidate, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain health plan customers, or continue to provide our products and services to such health plan customers on terms at least as favorable to us as currently provided, if they are acquired by other health plans that already participate in competing programs or are not interested in our programs. Increasing vertical integration efforts involving health plans and healthcare providers or entities that provide wellness services may increase these challenges. Our health plan customers that are part of larger healthcare enterprises may have greater bargaining power, which may lead to\nfurther pressure on the prices for our products and services. In addition, a reduction in the number of covered lives enrolled with our health plan customers or in the payments we receive could adversely affect our results of operations. Our health plan customers are subject to continuing competition and reduced reimbursement rates from governmental and private sources, which could lead current or prospective customers to seek reduced fees or choose to reduce or delay the purchase of our services. Finally, health plan customers could offer (and in some cases are offering) services themselves that compete directly with our offerings, stop providing our offerings to certain or all of their members (as one of our customers, United Healthcare, has done), or offer fitness benefits in addition to SilverSneakers and Prime Fitness, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe currently derive a significant percentage of our Healthcare segment revenues from three customers.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, three customers each comprised more than 10%, and together comprised approximately 45%, of our Healthcare segment\u2019s revenues. Our primary contracts with two of these customers continue through December 31, 2022, and our primary contract with the third customer continues through December 31, 2021. The loss or restructuring of a contract with any of these three customers or any other significant customers of our Healthcare segment could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. None of these three contracts allows the customer to terminate for convenience prior to the expiration of the contract.\nOur inability to renew and/or maintain contracts with our Healthcare segment customers and/or fitness partner locations under existing terms or restructure these contracts under favorable terms could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf our Healthcare segment customers and/or fitness partner locations choose not to renew their contracts with us (which does occur from time to time), our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Loss of a significant fitness partner or health plan customer or a reduction in a health plan customer's enrolled lives could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, a restructuring of a contract with a health plan customer and/or fitness partner on terms that aren\u2019t favorable to us could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nReductions in Medicare Advantage health plan reimbursement rates or changes in plan designs may negatively impact our Healthcare segment business and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our Healthcare segment revenue is indirectly derived from the monthly premium payments paid by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to our health plan customers for services they provide to Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. As a result, our results of operations are, in part, dependent on government funding levels for Medicare Advantage programs. An executive order issued in October 2019 seeks to encourage innovative Medicare Advantage benefit structures and plan designs, including through changes to supplemental benefits. Any changes that limit or reduce Medicare Advantage reimbursement levels, such as reductions in or limitations of reimbursement amounts or rates under these programs, reductions in funding of these programs, expansion of benefits without adequate funding, elimination of coverage for certain benefits, or elimination of coverage affecting the services that we provide, could have a material adverse effect on our Healthcare segment health plan customers, and as a result, on our business and results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by severe or unexpected weather, health epidemics or outbreaks of disease.\nAdverse weather conditions or other extreme changes in the weather may cause people to refrain, or prevent people, from visiting fitness partner locations and using our Healthcare segment services. Additionally, widespread health epidemics or outbreaks of disease, such as influenza or a virulent strain of coronavirus, may cause members to avoid public gathering places and negatively impact their use of our services. As some of the fees that we charge our customers are based on member participation, a decrease in member participation could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nCompliance with existing or newly adopted federal and state laws and regulations or new or revised interpretations of such requirements could adversely affect our results of operations or may require us to spend substantial amounts, and the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to penalties or negatively impact our ability to provide services.\nOur Healthcare segment customers are subject to considerable state and federal government regulation, and a substantial majority of our Healthcare segment business involves providing services to Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. As a result, we are subject directly to various federal laws and regulations, including the federal False Claims Act, billing and reimbursement requirements and other provisions related to fraud and abuse. In addition, our contracts with Medicare Advantage plans require us to comply with a number of regulatory provisions and to permit these health plan customers to perform compliance audits of our processes and programs. Many of these regulations are vaguely written and subject to differing interpretations that may, in certain cases, result in unintended consequences that could impact our ability to effectively deliver services. Further, we are required to comply with most requirements of the HIPAA privacy and security laws and regulations and may be subject to criminal or civil penalties for violations of these regulations. Certain of our services, including health utilization management and certain claims payment functions, require licensure and may be regulated by government agencies. We are subject to a variety of legal requirements in order to obtain and maintain such licenses, but little guidance is available to determine the scope of some of these requirements.\nWe continually monitor the extent to which federal and state legislation and regulations govern our operations. New federal or state laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing requirements that affect our operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If we are found to have violated applicable laws, to have caused any of our Healthcare segment customers to submit false claims or make false statements, or to have failed to comply with our contractual compliance obligations, we could be required to restructure our Healthcare segment operations, be subject to contractual penalties, including termination of our Healthcare segment customer agreements, and be subject to significant civil and criminal penalties.\nHealthcare reform efforts may result in a reduction to our revenues from government health programs and private insurance companies or otherwise directly or indirectly impact our business.\nThe healthcare industry is subject to various political, regulatory, scientific, and technological influences. Efforts at federal and state levels of government have resulted in laws and regulations intended to effect significant change within the healthcare system. The ACA, the most prominent of these efforts, affects coverage, delivery, and reimbursement of healthcare services. Among other effects, several of its provisions may increase the costs and/or reduce the revenues of our customers or prospective customers. For example, the ACA eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions by commercial health plans, bans annual benefit limits, and mandates minimum medical loss ratios for health plans.\nHowever, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the net effect and future of the ACA. The presidential administration and Congress have made significant changes to the ACA, its implementation and its interpretation. Effective January 2019, Congress eliminated the penalty associated with the ACA\u2019s individual mandate. As a result, a federal court in Texas ruled in December 2018 that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and determined that the rest of the ACA was, therefore, invalid. In December 2019, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld this decision with respect to the individual mandate, but remanded for further consideration of how this affects the rest of the law. The law remains in effect pending appeal. It is possible that the reforms imposed by the ACA or uncertainty regarding significant changes or court challenges to the law will adversely affect the profitability of our Healthcare segment customers and cause our Healthcare segment customers or prospective customers to reduce or delay the purchase of our services or to demand reduced fees. Because of this uncertainty and many other variables, including the ACA\u2019s complexity and the difficulty of predicting the impact of changes on other healthcare industry participants and the ultimate outcome of court challenges, we are unable to predict all of the ways in which the ACA could impact us. Furthermore, we could also be impacted by other legislative and regulatory healthcare reform initiatives. For example, beginning in 2020, the Chronic Care Act allows Medicare Advantage plans to cover supplemental benefits that are not primarily health-related, but that have the reasonable expectation of improving or maintaining health. Additionally, some presidential candidates and members of Congress have proposed measures that would expand government-sponsored coverage, including single-payor proposals (often referred to as \"Medicare for All\"). Further, the outcome of the 2020 federal election and its potential impact on health reform efforts is unknown.\nRisks Relating to Our Nutrition Segment\nOur Nutrition segment's future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing expenditures and our ability to select effective markets and media in which to advertise.\nOur Nutrition segment's future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing expenditures, including our ability to:\n\u2022\ncreate greater awareness of our Nutrition segment brands and programs;\n\u2022\nidentify the most effective and efficient levels of spending in each market, media and specific media vehicle;\n\u2022\ndetermine the appropriate creative messages and media mix for advertising, marketing and promotional expenditures;\n\u2022\neffectively manage marketing costs (including creative and media) in order to maintain acceptable customer acquisition costs;\n\u2022\nacquire cost-effective advertising;\n\u2022\nselect the most effective markets, media and specific media vehicles in which to advertise; and\n\u2022\nconvert Nutrition segment customer inquiries into actual orders.\nOur planned marketing expenditures for our Nutrition segment may not result in increased revenue or generate sufficient levels of brand name and program awareness. We may not be able to manage our Nutrition segment's marketing expenditures on a cost-effective basis whereby our Nutrition segment customer acquisition costs may exceed the contribution profit generated from each additional customer.\nOur Nutrition segment relies on third parties to provide it with adequate food supply, freight and fulfillment and Internet and networking services, the loss or disruption of any of which could cause our revenue, earnings or reputation to suffer.\nFood Manufacturers and Other Suppliers. Our Nutrition segment relies solely on third-party manufacturers to supply all of the food and other products we sell as well as packaging materials. If we are unable to obtain sufficient quantity, quality and variety of food, other products and packaging materials in a timely and low-cost manner from our manufacturers, we will be unable to fulfill our Nutrition segment customers\u2019 orders in a timely manner, which may cause us to lose revenue and market share or incur higher costs, as well as damage the value of our brands.\nFreight and Fulfillment. Currently, all of our Nutrition segment customer order fulfillment is handled by one third-party provider. Also, almost all of our direct to consumer Nutrition segment customer orders are shipped by one third-party provider and almost all of our orders for Nutrition segment retail programs were shipped by another third-party provider. Should these providers be unable to service our needs for even a short duration, our revenue and business could be adversely affected. Additionally, the cost and time associated with replacing these providers on short notice would add to our costs. Any replacement fulfillment provider would also require startup time, which could cause us to lose sales and market share.\nInternet and Networking. Our Nutrition segment business also depends on a number of third parties for Internet access and networking, and we have limited control over these third parties. Should our Nutrition segment's network connections go down, our ability to fulfill orders would be delayed. Further, if our Nutrition segment's websites or call center become unavailable for a noticeable period of time due to Internet or communication failures, our business could be adversely affected, including harm to our brands and loss of sales.\nTherefore, we are dependent on these third parties. The services we require from these parties may be disrupted by a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nlabor disruptions;\n\u2022\ndelivery problems;\n\u2022\nfinancial condition or results of operations;\n\u2022\ninternal inefficiencies;\n\u2022\nequipment failure;\n\u2022\nsevere weather;\n\u2022\nfire;\n\u2022\nnatural or man-made disasters; and\n\u2022\nwith respect to our food suppliers, shortages of ingredients or United States Department of Agriculture (\"USDA\") or United States Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) compliance issues.\nFurther, if a regional or global health epidemic or pandemic occurs, depending upon its location, duration and severity, our business could be severely affected. A regional or global health epidemic or pandemic might also adversely affect our business by disrupting the operations of our call center, creating negative popular sentiment among consumers of delivered food, or by disrupting or delaying our third-party providers' ability to, among other things (i) supply the products that we sell as well as packaging materials, (ii) fulfill Nutrition segment customer orders and (iii) provide internet and networking services.\nWe may be subject to claims that our Nutrition segment personnel are unqualified to provide proper weight loss advice.\nWe offer counseling options from weight loss counselors, registered dietitians and certified diabetes educators with varying levels of training. We may be subject to claims from our Nutrition segment customers alleging that our personnel lack the qualifications necessary to provide proper advice regarding weight loss and related topics. We may also be subject to claims that our Nutrition segment personnel have provided inappropriate advice or have inappropriately referred or failed to refer customers to health care providers for matters other than weight loss. Such claims could result in lawsuits, damage to our reputation and divert management\u2019s attention from our business, which would adversely affect our business.\nWe may be subject to health-related claims from our customers.\nOur Nutrition segment's weight loss programs do not include medical treatment or medical advice, and we do not engage physicians or nurses to monitor the progress of our Nutrition segment customers. Many people who are overweight suffer from other physical conditions, and our target customers could be considered a high-risk population. A Nutrition segment customer who experiences health problems could allege or bring a lawsuit against us on the basis that those problems were caused or worsened by participating in our weight management programs or by consuming one or more of our individual products. For example, our Nutrition segment's predecessor businesses suffered substantial losses due to health-related claims and related publicity. If we become subject to any such claims, while we would defend ourselves against such claims, we may ultimately be unsuccessful in our defense. Also, defending ourselves against such claims, regardless of their merit and ultimate outcome, would likely be lengthy and costly, and adversely affect our results of operations. Further, our general liability insurance may not cover claims of these types.\nThe weight management industry is highly competitive. If any of our competitors or a new entrant into the market with significant resources pursues a weight management program similar to ours, our Nutrition segment business could be significantly affected.\nCompetition is intense in the weight management industry and we must remain competitive in the areas of program efficacy, price, taste, customer service and brand recognition. The competitors of our Nutrition segment include companies selling pharmaceutical products and weight loss programs, digital tools and wearable trackers, as well as a wide variety of diet foods and meal replacement bars and shakes, appetite suppressants and nutritional supplements. Some of our Nutrition segment's competitors are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater resources. Our Nutrition segment business could be adversely affected if someone with significant resources decided to imitate our weight management programs. For example, if a major supplier of pre-packaged foods decided to enter this market and made a substantial investment of resources in advertising and training diet counselors, our Nutrition segment business could be significantly affected. Any increased competition from new entrants into our Nutrition segment's industry or any increased success by existing competition could result in reductions in our Nutrition segment sales or prices, or both, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on certain third-party agreements for a percentage of revenue.\nOur Nutrition segment has agreements with certain third-party retailers. Under these agreements, these third parties control when and how often our Nutrition segment products are offered and we are not guaranteed any minimum level of sales. Our Nutrition segment's largest third-party retailer has indicated to us that they will be reducing orders for, and the promotion of, our Nutrition segment products in 2020. If any third party elects not to renew their agreement with us or further reduces orders for our Nutrition segment products or the promotion of our Nutrition segment products, our revenue will suffer.\nIn addition, our third-party retailers may decide to stop selling our Nutrition segment products upon written notice, which may result in an increased level of reclamation claims. In the event any retailer terminates its relationship with us and the level of reclamation claims exceeds the estimated amount reserved on our balance sheet at the time of sale to the retailer, we will have to record an expense for the excess claims, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, in certain instances, we could be prohibited from selling our Nutrition segment products through competitors of these third parties for a specified time after the termination of the agreements.\nNew weight loss products or services may put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOn an ongoing basis, many existing and potential providers of weight loss solutions, including many pharmaceutical firms with significantly greater financial and operating resources than we have, are developing new products and services. The creation of a weight loss solution, such as a drug therapy, that is perceived to be safe, effective and \u201ceasier\u201d than a portion-controlled meal plan would put our Nutrition segment at a disadvantage in the marketplace and our results of operations could be negatively affected.\nWe may be subject to litigation from our competitors.\nOur Nutrition segment's competitors may pursue litigation against us based on our advertising or other marketing practices regardless of its merit and chances of success, especially if we engage in comparative advertising, which includes advertising that directly or indirectly mentions a competitor or a competitor\u2019s weight loss program in comparison to our Nutrition segment programs. While we would defend ourselves against any such claims, our defense may ultimately be unsuccessful. Also, defending against such claims, regardless of their merit and ultimate outcome, may be lengthy and costly, strain our resources and divert management\u2019s attention from their core responsibilities, which would have a negative impact on our business.\nWe have launched and expect to continue to launch new weight loss and nutrition programs and brands which may not be successful due to the failure of such programs or brands to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance, which could adversely affect our Nutrition segment business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere are a number of risks inherent in any new program or brand introduction, which could prevent us from achieving revenue growth and increasing our Nutrition segment's overall market share in the commercial weight loss and nutrition markets. Any new program or brand may fail to achieve the anticipated level of market acceptance or appeal to customer tastes and preferences. In addition, introduction costs, including product testing and marketing, may be greater than anticipated. If the new program or brand is not successful or falls short of anticipated market acceptance, we may be adversely affected by continued expenses and the diversion of management time to this initiative. Any or all of such events could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we do not continue to receive referrals from existing Nutrition segment customers, our Nutrition segment's customer acquisition cost may increase.\nWe rely on word-of-mouth advertising for a portion of our new Nutrition segment customers. If our brands suffer or the number of customers acquired through referrals drops due to other circumstances, our costs associated with acquiring new Nutrition segment customers and generating revenue will increase, which will, in turn, have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nWe use third-party marketing vendors to promote our Nutrition segment products. If the spokespersons affiliated with the third-party marketing vendors suffer adverse publicity or elect to not renew, our revenue could be adversely affected.\nOur Nutrition segment's marketing strategy depends in part on celebrity spokespersons, as well as customer spokespersons, to promote our weight loss programs. Any of these spokespersons may become the subject of adverse news reports, negative publicity or otherwise be alienated from a segment of our Nutrition segment customer base, whether weight loss related or not. If so, such events may reduce the effectiveness of his or her endorsement and, in turn, adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. Additionally, if a spokesperson elects not to renew their agreement with us, our revenue may suffer.\nChanges in customer preferences could negatively impact our operating results.\nOur Nutrition segment programs feature frozen and ready-to-go food selections, which we believe offer convenience and value to our customers. Our continued success depends, to a large degree, upon the continued popularity of our Nutrition segment programs versus various other weight loss, weight management and fitness regimens, such as low carbohydrate diets, appetite suppressants and diets featured in the published media. Changes in customer tastes and preferences away from our frozen or ready-to-go food and support and counseling services, and any failure to provide innovative responses to these changes, may have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur success is also dependent on our food innovation including maintaining a robust array of food items and improving the quality of existing items. If we do not continually expand our food items or provide customers with items that are desirable in taste and quality, our business could be adversely impacted.\nThe seasonal nature of the business of our Nutrition segment could cause our operating results to fluctuate.\nThe business of our Nutrition segment is seasonal, with revenue generally greatest (and advertising expenses generally highest) in the first calendar quarter, also known as diet season. Weak performance during diet season could negatively impact our Nutrition segment\u2019s performance for the remainder of the year. This seasonality could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate as the results of an interim financial period may not be indicative of our full year results. Seasonality also impacts relative revenue and profitability of each quarter of the year, both on a quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year basis.\nThe weight loss industry is subject to adverse publicity, which could harm our Nutrition segment business.\nThe weight loss industry receives adverse publicity from time to time, and the occurrence of such publicity could harm us, even if the adverse publicity is not directly related to us. In the early 1990s, our Nutrition segment's predecessor businesses were subject to extremely damaging adverse publicity relating to a large number of lawsuits alleging that the Nutrisystem weight loss program in use at that time led to gall bladder disease. This publicity was a factor that contributed to the bankruptcy of our Nutrition segment's predecessor businesses in 1993. In addition, our Nutrition segment's predecessor businesses were severely impacted by significant litigation and damaging publicity related to their customers\u2019 use of fen-phen as an appetite suppressant, which the FDA ordered withdrawn from the market in September 1997. The significant decline in business resulting from the fen-phen problems caused our Nutrition segment's predecessor businesses to close all of their company-owned weight loss centers.\nCongressional hearings about practices in the weight loss industry have also resulted in adverse publicity and a consequent decline in the revenue of weight loss businesses. Future research reports or publicity that is perceived as unfavorable or that question certain weight loss programs, products or methods could result in a decline in our revenue. Because of our dependence on customer perceptions, adverse publicity associated with illness or other undesirable effects resulting from the consumption of our Nutrition segment products or similar products by competitors, whether or not accurate, could also damage customer confidence in our Nutrition segment weight loss programs and result in a decline in revenue. Adverse publicity could arise even if the unfavorable effects associated with weight loss products or services resulted from the user\u2019s failure to use such products or services appropriately.\nThe industry in which our Nutrition segment operates is subject to governmental regulation that could increase in severity and hurt results of operations.\nThe industry in which our Nutrition segment operates is subject to federal, state and other governmental regulation. Certain federal and state agencies, such as the FTC, regulate and enforce such laws relating to advertising, disclosures to customers, privacy, customer pricing and billing arrangements and other customer protection matters. A determination by a federal or state agency, or a court, that any of our practices do not meet existing or new laws or regulations could result in liability, adverse publicity and restrictions on our business operations. Some advertising practices in the weight loss industry, in particular, have led to investigations from time to time by the FTC and other governmental agencies and many companies in the weight loss industry, including our Nutrition segment's predecessor businesses, have entered into consent decrees with the FTC relating to weight loss claims and other advertising practices. In addition, the FTC\u2019s Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising require us and other weight loss companies to use a statement as to what the typical weight loss a customer can expect to achieve on our Nutrition segment programs when using a customer\u2019s weight\nloss testimonial in advertising. Federal and state regulation of advertising practices generally, and in the weight loss industry in particular, may increase in scope or severity in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOther aspects of the industry in which our Nutrition segment operates are also subject to government regulation. For example, the manufacturing, labeling and distribution of food products, including dietary supplements, are subject to strict USDA and FDA requirements and food manufacturers are subject to rigorous inspection and other requirements of the USDA and FDA, and companies operating in foreign markets must comply with those countries\u2019 requirements for proper labeling, controls on hygiene, food preparation and other matters. If federal, state, local or foreign regulation of the weight loss industry increases for any reason, then we may be required to incur significant expenses, as well as modify our operations to comply with new regulatory requirements, which could harm our operating results. Additionally, remedies available in any potential administrative or regulatory actions may include product recalls and requiring us to refund amounts paid by all affected customers or pay other damages, which could be substantial.\nLaws and regulations directly applicable to communications, operations or commerce over the Internet such as those governing intellectual property, privacy, libel and taxation, are becoming more prevalent and some remain unsettled. If we are required to comply with new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, or if we are unable to comply with these laws, regulations or interpretations, our business could be adversely affected.\nFuture laws or regulations, including laws or regulations affecting our marketing and advertising practices, relations with customers, employees, service providers, or our services and products, may have an adverse impact on us.\nThe sale of ingested products involves product liability and other risks.\nLike other distributors of products that are ingested, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims if the use of our Nutrition segment products results in illness or injury. The foods that we resell in the U.S. are subject to laws and regulations, including those administered by the USDA and FDA that establish manufacturing practices and quality standards for food products. Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our business as existing insurance coverage may not be adequate. Distributors of weight loss food products, including dietary supplements, as well as our Nutrition segment's predecessor businesses, have been named as defendants in product liability lawsuits from time to time. The successful assertion or settlement of an uninsured claim, a significant number of insured claims or a claim exceeding the limits of our insurance coverage would harm us by adding costs to the business and by diverting the attention of senior management from the operation of our business. We may also be subject to claims that our Nutrition segment products contain contaminants, are improperly labeled, include inadequate instructions as to use or inadequate warnings covering interactions with other substances. Product liability litigation, even if not meritorious, is very expensive and could also entail adverse publicity for us and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, the products we distribute, or certain components of those products, may be subject to product recalls or other deficiencies. Any negative publicity associated with these actions would adversely affect our brands and may result in decreased product sales and, as a result, lower revenue and profits.", "PERMNO": 76788, "SIC": 8090, "TIC": "TVTY"}
