{"cik": "1130713", "company": "OVERSTOCK.COM, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAny investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Please consider the following risk factors carefully. If any one or more of the following risks were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, and the market price of our securities could decrease significantly. Statements below to the effect that an event could or would harm our business (or have an adverse effect on our business or similar statements) mean that the event could or would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, which in turn could or would have a material adverse effect on the market price of our securities. Many of the risks we face involve more than one type of risk. Consequently, you should carefully read all of the risk factors below, and in any reports we file with the SEC after we file this Form 10-K, before making any decision to acquire or hold our securities. The occurrence of any of these risks could harm our business, the trading price of our securities could decline, and investors could lose part or all of their investment.\nHolders of, and potential investors in, our Series A-1 Preferred stock or our Series B Preferred stock should also read \"Additional Risks Relating to our Series A-1 Preferred stock and/or our Series B Preferred stock,\" below.\nRisks Relating to Our Company and its Operational, Litigation and Regulatory Environment\nWe depend on third-party companies to perform functions critical to our business, and any failure or increased cost on their part could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend on third-party companies, including third-party carriers and a large number of independent fulfillment partners whose products we offer for sale on our Website, to perform functions critical to our ability to deliver products and services to our customers on time and at a reasonable cost. We depend on our carriers and fulfillment partners to perform traditional retail operations such as maintaining inventory, preparing merchandise for shipment to our customers and delivering purchased merchandise on a timely and cost-effective basis. We also depend on the delivery and product assembly services that we and they utilize, on the payment processors that facilitate our customers' payments for their purchases, and on other third parties over which we have no control, for the operation of our business. Difficulties with any of our significant fulfillment partners or third-party carriers, delivery or product assembly services, payment processors or other third parties involved in our business, regardless of the reason, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nWe face intense competition and may not be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors.\nThe online retail market is evolving rapidly and is intensely competitive. Barriers to entry are minimal, and current and new competitors can launch new websites at a relatively low cost. We currently compete with numerous competitors, including:\n\u2022online retailers with or without discount departments, including Amazon.com, AliExpress (part of the Alibaba Group), eBay, and Rakuten.com;\n\u2022online shopping services, including Google Shopping and Facebook;\n\u2022online specialty retailers such as Wayfair, Build.com, Houzz, Hayneedle, Rugs.com, Groupon, World Market, and Zulily;\n\u2022furniture specialists including Ashley Furniture, Bob's Discount Furniture, Havertys, Raymour & Flanigan, At Home, Tuesday Morning, Living Spaces, Nebraska Furniture Mart, RC Willey, and Rooms To Go;\n\u2022traditional general merchandise and specialty retailers and liquidators including Bed, Bath & Beyond, Best Buy, Costco, Crate and Barrel, Ethan Allen, Gilt, Home Depot, HomeGoods, Hudson's Bay Company, IKEA, J.C. Penney Company, Kirkland's, Kohl's, Lands' End, Lowe's, Macy's, Nordstrom, Pier 1 Imports, Pottery Barn, Restoration Hardware, Ross Stores, Saks Fifth Avenue, Sears, T.J. Maxx, Target, Walmart, West Elm, and Williams-Sonoma, all of which also have an online presence; and\n\u2022online liquidators such as SmartBargains.\nWe expect that existing and future traditional manufacturers and retailers will continue to add or improve their e-commerce offerings, and that our existing and future e-commerce competitors, including Amazon, will continue to increase their offerings, their delivery capabilities, and the ways in which they enable shoppers to purchase goods, including their mobile technology and the voice-activated shopping services offered by Amazon. Further, large marketplace websites and sites which aggregate marketplace sellers with a large product selection are becoming increasingly popular, and we may not be able to place our products on these sites to take advantage of their internal search platforms and some shoppers may begin their searches at these websites rather than utilize traditional search engines at all. Many of our competitors specialize in one or more of the areas in which we offer products. For example, our furniture offerings compete with numerous retail furniture websites and traditional furniture retail specialists. We also face competition from shopping services such as Google Express, which offers products from Walmart, Costco, Target and other retailers. Competition from our competitors, many of whom have\nlonger operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition, greater access to capital and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do, affects us and has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nOur business depends on effective marketing, including marketing via email and social network messaging and our competitors have and may continue to directly increase our marketing costs, may outspend us on marketing, and also have and may continue to cause us to decrease certain types of marketing.\nWe depend on effective marketing and customer traffic. We depend on email to promote our site and offerings and to generate a substantial portion of our revenue. If a significant portion of our target customers no longer utilize email, or if we are unable to effectively and economically deliver email or marketing materials through other channels to our potential customers, whether for legal, regulatory or other reasons, it would have a material adverse effect on our business. We also rely on social network messaging services for marketing purposes, and anything that limits our ability or our customers' ability or desire to utilize social network services could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition to competing with us for customers, suppliers, and employees, our competitors have and may continue to directly increase our operating costs, by driving up the cost of various forms of online advertising. Furthermore, our competitors may outspend us on various forms of advertising or marketing, making our marketing efforts less effective. We may elect to decrease our use of sponsored search or other forms of marketing from time to time in order to decrease our costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business. We may also elect to spend additional amounts on sponsored search or other forms of marketing from time to time in order to increase traffic to our Website, or to take other strategic actions to increase traffic and/or conversion. If we are unable to develop, improve, implement and maintain effective and efficient cost-effective advertising and marketing programs, it would have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business.\nEconomic factors, including our increasing exposure to the U.S. housing industry and the potential for a decrease in consumer spending, could adversely affect us.\nEconomic conditions, particularly any weakness in the United States housing market, may adversely affect our financial performance. Over the last several years, the percentage of our sales from home-related products has increased substantially. We believe that our sales of home-related products are affected by the strength of the U.S. housing industry, and that downturns in the U.S. housing industry could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects. Similarly, a substantial portion of the products and services we offer are products or services that consumers may view as discretionary items rather than necessities. As a result, our results of operations are sensitive to changes in macro-economic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending. Difficult macro-economic conditions also impact our customers' ability to obtain consumer credit. Other factors, including consumer confidence, employment levels, interest rates, tax rates, consumer debt levels, and fuel and energy costs could reduce consumer spending or change consumer purchasing habits. Slowdowns in the U.S. or global economy, or an uncertain economic outlook, could materially adversely affect consumer spending habits and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nThe changing job market, the loss of key personnel, the changing job structure, or any inability to attract, retain and engage additional key personnel could affect our ability to successfully grow our business.\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the continued service and performance of our senior management and other key personnel. Our performance also depends on our ability to retain and motivate our officers and key employees. Given the current labor shortage and labor migration trends in the U.S., and more businesses allowing employees to work remotely, we are forced to compete with businesses in other locations and states to attract and retain key employees from a smaller pool of qualified individuals. We recently announced that most of our workforce will be permitted to continue to work remotely on a long-term basis, with only limited days in the office. This new job structure of long-term remote work for most of our workforce could create consequences such as a lack of productivity, a lack of engagement, and employee fatigue. Some key employees may leave to work for businesses they find more attractive. The loss of, or the inability to retain or engage the services of key employees for any reason, could harm our business. Our future success depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, engage, retain, and motivate highly-skilled personnel. Our failure to attract, retain, and engage the personnel necessary to successfully operate our business could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nWe rely upon paid and natural search engines to rank our product offerings, and our financial results may suffer if we are unable to regain our prior rankings in natural searches.\nWe rely on paid and natural search engines to attract consumer interest in our product offerings, including Google, Bing, and Yahoo!. Changes to their ranking algorithms and competition from other retailers to attract consumer interest may adversely affect our product offerings in paid and/or natural searches, and we may at times be subject to ranking penalties if the operators of search engines believe we are not in compliance with their guidelines. Search engine companies change their\nnatural search engine algorithms periodically and online retailers compete to rank well with these search engine companies, and our ranking in natural searches may be adversely affected by those changes, as has occurred from time to time, which has led us to pursue revenue growth in other more expensive marketing channels. Google's search engine is dominant in our business and has historically been a significant source of traffic to our website, much of it at essentially no incremental cost to us. Search engine companies may also determine that we are not in compliance with their guidelines from time to time, as has occurred in the past, and they may penalize us in their search algorithms as a result. In recent years, we have experienced declines in our rankings in Google's natural search engine, which has required us to utilize more expensive marketing channels or otherwise compensate for the loss of some of the natural search traffic. Any future declines in our rankings in Google's natural search engine could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we do not maintain profitability and/or positive cash flow from operations, our ability to continue in business will depend on our ability to raise additional capital, obtain financing or monetize significant assets, and we may be unable to do so.\nWe experienced significant losses in years leading up to 2020. At December 31, 2019 our accumulated deficit was $580.4 million. Although our financial results were significantly better in 2020 and 2021, we may be unable to maintain profitability in future years. If we are unable to successfully manage our business in the future, our ability to continue in business could depend on our ability to raise sufficient additional capital, obtain sufficient financing, or sell or otherwise monetize significant assets such as our corporate headquarters. Additionally, we may not be able to raise capital on acceptable terms or at all. The occurrence of any of the foregoing risks would have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nThe duration and extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic might impact our results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to profoundly and adversely affect the world economy in many ways. The duration and extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic is currently unknown and difficult to predict, but could result in a loss of new and existing workforce members, including key personnel, due to adverse health effects of the disease, increased competition for employees, a lack of consumer demand for the services and products we offer, an inability to operate our warehouses or other key locations, such as data centers, at full capacity, and could result in an increased risk of penalties or liabilities associated with new policies and regulations, and could adversely affect our business and financial results. Further, the extent to which the increased sales volume we realized following the onset of the pandemic will continue when the impacts of the pandemic subside is uncertain and could have a negative impact on our financial performance.\nTariffs, bans, the spread of illness, or other measures or events that increase the effective price of products or limit our ability to access products we or our suppliers or fulfillment partners import into the United States could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe and many of our suppliers and fulfillment partners source a large percentage of the products we offer on our Website from China and other countries. If the United States imposes tariffs or bans on imports, or if other factors that are outside of our control increase the prices of imported products sold on our Website or limit our ability to access products sold on our Website, the increased prices and/or supply chain challenges could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects. Further, the broader global effects of potentially reduced consumer confidence and spending related to COVID-19, including new variants thereof, could also have a negative effect on our overall business.\nThe continuing impacts of COVID-19 could have technology and security consequences, could result in policies, mandates, or regulations that apply unevenly to businesses, could cause employee fatigue, and could negatively impact our operations.\nIn light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many of our employees and contractors continue to work remotely. Additional risks are inherent when employees and contractors work remotely, including risks that third-party Internet and phone service providers may not provide adequate services for employees and contractors to perform their responsibilities, risks that hardware, software, or other technological problems or failures could prevent employees or contractors from performing their responsibilities and could take an excessive amount of time to resolve and risks that employees and contractors may not be trained as effectively or monitored as closely from remote locations, creating greater risks for the security of confidential information. Additionally, government policies, mandates, or regulations created in response to COVID-19 could apply unevenly to businesses, whether based on business size, industry, or some other reason, which could make certain businesses less desirable for employment and could impair our ability to attract and/or retain key employees. Employees may leave to work for businesses they find more attractive. Employees may also become fatigued by the work-from-home setting and may become less productive or look for employment that is not work-from-home. Any such occurrences could have a material negative impact on the business.\nOur business depends on the Internet, our infrastructure and transaction-processing systems.\nWe are completely dependent on our infrastructure and on the availability, reliability and security of the Internet and related systems. Although we have migrated and continue to migrate some of our computer systems and operations to the public cloud, a substantial majority of our computer and communications infrastructure is running in our private cloud on hardware that is located at a single Overstock owned and operated facility. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, cyber-attacks, acts of war, break-ins, earthquake and similar events. Our back-up facility by itself is not adequate to support fulfillment of sales orders. Our servers and applications are vulnerable to malware, physical or electronic break-ins, internal sabotage, and other disruptions, the occurrence of any of which could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of critical data or the inability to accept and fulfill customer orders. Any internal or critical third-party system interruption that results in the unavailability of our Website or our mobile app or reduced performance of our transaction systems could interrupt or substantially reduce our ability to conduct our business. We have experienced periodic systems interruptions due to server failure, application failure, power failure and intentional cyber-attacks in the past, and may experience additional interruptions or failures in the future. Any failure or impairment of our infrastructure or of the availability of the Internet or related systems could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects. In addition, the occurrence of any event that would adversely affect e-commerce or discourage or prevent consumers from shopping online or via mobile apps could significantly decrease the volume of our sales.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks and risks of data loss or other security breaches.\nOur business involves the storage and transmission of users' proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, and to resulting claims, fines, and litigation. We have developed certain software products to assist with the operation and management of our business which could contain flaws or vulnerabilities that could present cyber security-related risks, data loss, other security breaches, or damage to our business, our suppliers, or our customers. We have been subjected to a variety of cyber-attacks, which have increased in number and variety over time. We believe our systems are probed by potential hackers virtually 24/7, and we expect the problem will continue to grow worse over time. Cyber-attacks may target us, our customers, our suppliers, banks, credit card processors, delivery services, e-commerce in general or the communication infrastructure on which we depend. Any flaws or vulnerabilities in the software we created or technologies designed to prevent attacks on our systems and other third-party systems, compromise of our security, data breaches, malfunctions, or errors, could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business. Moreover, any insurance coverage we may carry may be inadequate to cover the expenses and other potential financial exposure we could face as a result of a cyber-attack or data breach.\nWe recently reversed the valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets, and we may not be able to realize these assets in the future. Our deferred tax assets may also be subject to additional valuation allowances, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nDetermining whether a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is appropriate requires judgment and an evaluation of all positive and negative evidence. At each reporting period, we assess the need for, or the sufficiency of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. During 2021, based on the weight of all the positive and negative evidence, we concluded that it was more likely than not that we will realize certain federal and state net deferred tax assets based on future taxable income. Therefore, we reversed the valuation allowance on those deferred tax assets during 2021.\nOur conclusion that it is more likely than not that we will realize certain federal and state net deferred tax assets is primarily based on our estimate of future taxable income. Our estimate of future taxable income is based on internal projections which primarily consider historical performance, but also include various internal estimates and assumptions as well as certain external data. We believe all of these inputs to be reasonable, although inherently subject to judgment. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates of future taxable income, we may need to reestablish a valuation allowance for some or all of our deferred tax assets. Establishing an allowance on our net deferred tax assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nIf the overall legal or tax treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce changes adversely, it could impact our ability to conduct business online and, accordingly, our financial results.\nNew or revised international, federal, state or local laws, regulations, or court decisions may subject us to additional requirements that could increase the cost of doing business, decrease our revenues, or impact our business model. In addition, new or revised international, federal, state or local tax regulations or court decisions may subject us or our customers to additional sales, income and other taxes. For example, the U.S. Supreme Court rendered an opinion in 2018 that overturned existing precedent and held, among other things, that a state may require an out-of-state seller with no physical presence in the state to collect and remit sales taxes on goods the seller ships to consumers in the state. Other new or revised taxes could expose\nus to additional risk, could increase the cost of doing business online, and could increase internal costs necessary to capture data and collect and remit taxes. Any of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIf we do not successfully optimize and operate our distribution center, warehouse, and customer service operations, our business could be harmed.\nWe have expanded, contracted and otherwise modified our distribution center, warehouse, and customer service operations from time to time in the past, and expect that we will continue to do so. If we do not successfully optimize and operate our distribution center, warehouse, and customer service operations, it could significantly limit our ability to meet customer demand, customer shipping or return time expectations, or result in excessive costs and expenses for the size of our business. Because it is difficult to predict demand, we may not be able to manage our facilities in an optimal way, which may result in excess or insufficient inventory or warehousing capacity. Our fulfillment and customer service centers may also fail to staff at optimal levels. Our failure to manage our warehouse operations, distribution centers or our fulfillment and customer service centers optimally could adversely affect our financial results and customer experience and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nWe and certain of our former and current officers and directors have been named in shareholder class action lawsuits and shareholder derivative lawsuits, which could require significant additional management time and attention, result in significant additional legal expenses or result in government enforcement actions.\nWe and certain of our former and current officers and directors have been named in shareholder class action lawsuits and shareholder derivative lawsuits, and may become subject to further litigation, government investigations or proceedings arising therefrom. The pending litigation and any future litigation, investigations or other actions that may be filed or initiated against us or our current or former officers or directors may be time consuming and expensive. We cannot predict what losses, if any, we may incur in these litigation matters, and expect to incur significant legal expenditures in defending and responding to these litigation matters.\nAny such legal proceedings, if decided adversely to us, could result in significant monetary damages, penalties and reputational harm, and will likely involve significant defense and other costs. We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and certain of our officers, requiring us to indemnify them. Further, our insurance may not cover all claims that have been or may be brought against us, and insurance coverage may not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost. As a result, we may be exposed to substantial uninsured or under-insured liabilities, including pursuant to our indemnification obligations, which could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe and tZERO, which we own a direct minority interest of, are both the subjects of, and parties to, investigations by the SEC Division of Enforcement, which has required us to expend significant financial and legal resources. The resolution of those investigations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs previously disclosed, in February 2018, the Division of Enforcement of the SEC informed tZERO, and subsequently informed us, that it was conducting an investigation and requested that we and tZERO voluntarily provide certain information and documents related to tZERO and the tZERO security token offering (the \"tZERO Request\"). In December 2018, we received a follow-up request from the SEC relating to GSR Capital Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempted company (the \"GSR Request\"). In October 2019, we received a subpoena from the SEC requiring us to produce documents and other information related to the Series A-1 Preferred stock dividend we announced to stockholders in June 2019 (discussed below in Note 15-Stockholders' Equity) and requesting copies of 10b5-1 plans entered into by certain officers and directors. In December 2019, we received a subpoena from the SEC requesting documents related to the GSR transaction and the alternative trading system run by tZERO ATS, LLC (the \"GSR and tZERO Subpoena\"). Also in December 2019, we received a subpoena from the SEC requesting our insider trading policies as well as certain employment and consulting agreements. We also received requests from the SEC for our communications with our former Chief Executive Officer and Director, Patrick Byrne, and the matters referenced in the December 2019 subpoenas. In May 2020, we received a subpoena from the SEC requesting additional data related to the tZERO ATS (the \"tZERO ATS Subpoena\"). In January 2021, we received a subpoena from the SEC requesting information regarding our Retail guidance in 2019 and certain communications with current and former executives, board members, and investors.\ntZERO ATS, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of tZERO, reached an agreement to settle the matters covered by the tZERO Request, the GSR Request, the GSR and tZERO Subpoena, and the tZERO ATS Subpoena. The agreement required tZERO ATS, LLC, to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation of and any future violations of Rules 301(b)(2) and (5) of Regulation ATS, which generally relate to notice and fair access, agree to be censured, and pay a $800,000 civil penalty. The settlement did not allege that we, tZERO, tZERO ATS, LLC, or any of our current or former executives or\ndirectors engaged in intentional fraud or misconduct, nor did tZERO ATS admit or deny any facts alleged in the order. We continue to cooperate with the SEC in the remaining matters.\nAlthough we believe that we have fully complied with all relevant laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that the SEC will not commence an enforcement action against us or members of our management, or as to the ultimate resolution of any enforcement action that the SEC may decide to bring. Under applicable law, the SEC has the ability to impose significant sanctions on companies and individuals who are found to have violated the provisions of applicable federal securities laws, including cease and desist orders, civil money penalties, and barring individuals from serving as directors or officers of public companies. We have expended significant financial and legal resources responding to the SEC subpoena and such responses have required a significant amount of the time and attention of our senior management and personnel. Defending any enforcement action brought by the SEC against us or members of our management would involve further significant expenditures and the resolution of any such enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, the outcome of any investigation related to the activities of tZERO could result in negative publicity for tZERO or us or limit the products which tZERO may be able to offer, which may have an adverse effect on the current and future business ventures of tZERO or us.\nOur insurance coverage and indemnity rights may not adequately protect us against loss.\nThe types, coverage, or the amounts of any insurance coverage we may carry from time to time may not be adequate to compensate us for any losses we may actually incur in the operation of our business. We are not indemnified by all of our suppliers or fulfillment partners, and any indemnification rights we may have may not be enforceable or adequate to cover actual losses we may incur as a result of our sales of their products. Actual losses for which we are not insured or indemnified, or which exceed our insurance coverage or the capacity of our indemnitors or our ability to enforce our indemnity agreements, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nWe are partially self-insured with respect to our employees' health insurance. If the actual costs of these claims exceed the amounts we have accrued for them, we would incur additional expense.\nBeginning January 1, 2017, we are partially self-insured with respect to our employees' health insurance, except to the extent of stop-loss coverage that limits our losses both on a per employee basis and an aggregate basis. The actual costs of our employees' health insurance claims could exceed our estimates of those costs for a number of reasons, including more claims or larger claims than we expect, and increases in the costs of healthcare generally. If the actual cost of our employees' health insurance claims and related expenses exceeds the amounts we have accrued, we may be required to record additional charges for these claims and/or to establish additional cash reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nWe are currently subject to claims that we have infringed intellectual property rights of third parties and may be subjected to additional infringement claims in the future.\nWe are currently and may in the future be subject to claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, by offering allegedly infringing products or otherwise. We have contested and expect to continue to contest claims we consider unfounded rather than settling such claims, even when we expect the costs of contesting the claims could potentially exceed the cost of settlement. Any claims may result in significant expenditure of our financial and managerial resources and may result in us making significant damages or settlement payments or changes to our business. We could be prohibited from using software or business processes, or required to obtain licenses from third parties, which could be expensive or unavailable. Any such difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nWe may be unable to protect our proprietary technology and to obtain trademark protection for our marks.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our software and other proprietary intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with our employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates, and others to establish and protect our proprietary rights, including the law pertaining to trade secrets. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property or trade secrets without authorization. In addition, we cannot ensure that others will not independently develop similar intellectual property. Third parties have in the past recruited and may in the future recruit our employees who have had access to our proprietary technologies, processes and operations. These recruiting efforts expose us to the risk that such employees and those hiring them will misappropriate and exploit our intellectual property and trade secrets. We may be unable to protect against such risks, in the United States or elsewhere, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Although we have registered and are pursuing the registration of our key trademarks in the United States and some other countries, some of our trade names may not be eligible to receive registered trademark protection. In addition, effective trademark protection may not be available or we may not seek protection in every country in which we market or sell our products and services, including in the United States.\nOur competitors might adopt product or service marks like our marks or might try to prevent us from using our marks. Any claim by another party against us, or customer confusion related to our trademarks, or our failure to obtain trademark registration, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nWe depend on our suppliers' and fulfillment partners' representations regarding product safety, content and quality, and for proper labeling of products.\nWe rely on our suppliers' and fulfillment partners' representations of product safety, content and quality, and proper labeling of products. Issues or concerns regarding product safety, labeling, content or quality could result in consumer or governmental claims and could adversely affect our financial results and business. Any indemnity agreement we may have with a supplier or fulfillment partner of a product may be inadequate or inapplicable, and any insurance coverage we may carry may be inadequate. Even unsuccessful claims could result in the expenditure of funds and management time and could have a negative impact on our business. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nWe have an evolving business model, which increases the complexity of our business.\nIn prior years we added additional types of services and product offerings and in some cases, we modified or discontinued those offerings, and in some cases have re-launched offerings we had previously terminated. We may continue to try to offer additional types of products or services, and we do not know whether any of them will be successful. From time to time we have also modified aspects of our business model relating to our product mix and the mix of direct/partner sourcing of the products we offer. In addition, we continue to experiment with new technologies to enhance the customer experience and iterate on delivery of new features. The additions and modifications to our business have increased the complexity of our business and impacted our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. Further, our efforts to promote a culture of innovation amongst our technologists in an attempt to stay ahead of the competition may result in the introduction of technologies that are less mature or stable which could cause problems in our website or back-end logistics systems. Future additions to or modifications of our business are likely to have similar effects. Further, any new business, technology, or website we launch that is not favorably received by consumers could damage our reputation or our brand. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business, prospects, and the trading prices of our securities.\nOur international business efforts could adversely affect us.\nWe sell products in international markets. International sales and transactions are subject to inherent risks and challenges that could adversely affect us, including:\n\u2022the need to develop new supplier and manufacturer relationships;\n\u2022the need to comply with additional U.S. and foreign laws and regulations;\n\u2022changes in international laws, regulatory requirements, taxes and tariffs;\n\u2022our limited experience with different local cultures and standards;\n\u2022geopolitical events, such as war and terrorist attacks;\n\u2022the risk that the products we offer may not appeal to customers in international markets; and\n\u2022the additional resources and management attention required for such expansion.\nOur international business could expose us to penalties for non-compliance with laws applicable to international business and trade, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Foreign data protection, privacy and other laws and regulations are different and often more restrictive than those in the United States. Compliance with such laws and regulations will result in additional costs and may necessitate changes to our business practices, which may adversely affect our business. To the extent that we make purchases or sales denominated in foreign currencies, we would have foreign currency risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nWe are subject to the risk of possibly becoming an investment company under the Investment Company Act.\nThe Investment Company Act regulates certain companies that invest in, hold or trade securities. Primarily as a result of a portion of our assets consisting of indirectly-held minority investment positions, we are subject to the risk of inadvertently becoming an investment company. Because registration under the Investment Company Act would make it impractical for us to operate our business, we need to avoid becoming subject to the registration requirements of the Investment Company Act. To do so, we may structure transactions in a less advantageous manner than if we did not have Investment Company Act concerns, or we may avoid otherwise economically desirable transactions and/or strategic initiatives due to those concerns. In addition, events beyond our control, including significant appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain of our holdings or adverse\ndevelopments with respect to our ownership of certain of our subsidiaries, could result in us inadvertently becoming an investment company. If it were established that we were an investment company, there would be a risk, among other material adverse consequences, that we could become subject to monetary penalties or injunctive relief, or both, in an action brought by the SEC, that we would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties or that third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions with us undertaken during the period it was established that we were an unregistered investment company. If it were established that we were an investment company, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial operations and our ability to continue our business.\nOur decision to accept and hold cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin, may subject us to exchange risk and additional tax and regulatory requirements.\nIn 2014, we began accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for purchases on our website. Neither bitcoin nor any of the other cryptocurrencies we may hold are considered legal tender or backed by any government, and bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies we may hold have experienced price volatility, technological glitches and various law enforcement and regulatory interventions. The use of cryptocurrency such as bitcoin has been prohibited or effectively prohibited in some countries. If we fail to comply with regulations or prohibitions applicable to us, we could face regulatory or other enforcement actions and potential fines and other consequences. Our Board of Directors has authorized us to retain, in bitcoin, up to 100% of our sales revenues paid for by customers in bitcoin. From time to time we hold bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly, and we have exchange rate risk on the amounts we hold as well as the risks that regulatory or other developments may adversely affect the value of the cryptocurrencies we hold. We may choose not to hedge or may be unable to fully hedge our exposure to cryptocurrencies and may at times be unable to convert cryptocurrencies to U.S. dollars. If any regulatory authority asserts that we require a license or other regulatory approval to conduct business or own an interest in other businesses involving cryptocurrencies, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business.\nWe may be required to recognize losses relating to our direct and indirect equity interests in startup businesses.\nWe hold direct and indirect noncontrolling interests in several companies that are in the startup or development stages. Many of these interests are in companies held within the Medici Ventures, L.P. fund, over which we have no control. Noncontrolling interests and passive investments are inherently risky because we may not have the ability to influence business decisions. Further, these interests are inherently risky because the market for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages, unproven, and may never materialize. These companies may abandon, modify, or alter their product and service mix and overall strategy, whether due to COVID-19 or otherwise. Additionally, since these interests are in companies that are in the early startup or development stages, even if their technology or products are viable, they may not be able to obtain the capital or resources necessary to successfully bring their technology or products to market. Furthermore, the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may limit the ability for these entities to raise capital in the future. Furthermore, we have no assurance that the technology or products of companies we have funded would be successful, even if they were brought to market. We may in the future recognize losses related to these interests. In addition, we may be unable to sell or otherwise monetize any of the interests we have acquired or may acquire in the future. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could be material and could have a material adverse effect of our financial results and business.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock and Other Securities\nThe trading prices of our securities may be adversely affected by short-selling activities involving our common stock.\nThe trading prices of our common stock and other securities have been and may continue to be volatile. Our stock price fluctuations may be due in part to short-selling activity related to our common stock. The practice of short-selling activity may adversely affect our common stock price, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to raise capital and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, business and prospects.\nOur quarterly operating results are volatile and may adversely affect the market prices of our common stock and preferred stock, and you may lose all or a part of your investment.\nOur revenues and operating results have varied in the past and may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. In addition to the other risk factors described in this report, factors that have caused and/or could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate and in turn affect the market prices of our common stock and preferred stock include:\n\u2022increases in the cost of advertising and changes in our sales and marketing expenditures;\n\u2022our inability to retain existing customers or encourage repeat purchases;\n\u2022the extent to which our existing and future marketing campaigns are successful;\n\u2022price competition, particularly in the costs of marketing as well as in product pricing;\n\u2022the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures;\n\u2022the amount and timing of our purchases of inventory;\n\u2022our inability to manage distribution operations or provide adequate levels of customer service;\n\u2022increases in the cost of fuel, transportation or distribution;\n\u2022our inability to implement technology changes or integrate operations and technologies from acquisitions or other business combinations;\n\u2022our efforts to offer new lines of products and services; and\n\u2022our inability to attract users to our website.\nAny of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business and our ability to raise capital and could have a material adverse effect on the holders of our common stock and of our preferred stock.\nOur outstanding preferred stock could adversely affect the holders of our common stock in some circumstances.\nWe have two series of preferred stock outstanding. The preferred stock could adversely affect the holders of our common stock in some circumstances. The preferred stock generally votes with the common stock, with holders of the preferred stock having one vote for each share held. As of December 31, 2021, the 4,560,289 outstanding shares of preferred stock constituted approximately 10% of the total number of shares of the preferred stock and the common stock, taken together. Holders of the Series A-1 Preferred stock are entitled to an annual cash dividend of $0.16 per share, and holders of the Series B Preferred stock are entitled to an annual cash dividend at the annual rate of 1.0% multiplied by $15.68, in each case in preference to any dividend payment to the holders of the common stock, out of funds legally available for payment of dividends and subject to declaration by our Board of Directors. Holders of our preferred stock are also generally entitled to participate in any dividends we pay on the common stock. The preferred stock ranks equally with the common stock upon our liquidation, winding up or dissolution, with each share of Series A-1 Preferred stock and each share of Series B Preferred stock being treated as though it were a share of our common stock. Generally, in a business combination, we are obliged to use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause each share of the preferred stock to be treated as a share of common stock. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the holders of the common stock in connection with any such transactions.\nFuture sales or other distributions of our common or preferred stock may depress our stock price or subject us to limitations on our ability to use our net operating and tax credit carryforwards.\nSales or other distributions of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or our preferred stock, in the public market or otherwise, by us or by a significant stockholder, has in the past and could in the future, depress the trading price of our common or preferred stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. The transfer of ownership of a significant portion of our outstanding shares of common or preferred stock in the public market or otherwise, by us or by a significant stockholder, within a three-year period could adversely affect our ability to use our net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards to offset future taxable net income.\nIn addition, we may issue additional shares of our common or preferred stock from time to time in the future in amounts that may be significant. We have sold common stock including under our \"at the market\" sales agreement with JonesTrading and D.A. Davidson and in follow-on underwritten offerings in the past and may do so in the future. The sale of substantial amounts of our common or preferred stock, by us or a significant stockholder, or the perception that these sales may occur, could adversely affect the trading prices of either or both of these securities or subject us to limitations on our ability to use our net operating and tax credit carryforwards.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions which could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying, or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our Board of Directors. Among other things, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions:\n\u2022limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022limiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings;\n\u2022providing that our Board of Directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022only permitting the Board of Directors to fix the number of directors and to fill vacancies;\n\u2022prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our Board of Directors;\n\u2022controlling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of Board of Directors and stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022designating a state court located in the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for specified matters.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.\nAny provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock or other securities and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock or other securities.\nAdditional Risks Relating to our Series A-1 Preferred stock and/or our Series B Preferred stock\nOur Series A-1 Preferred stock may only be sold through the tZERO ATS and certain broker-dealers may not be willing to trade on the tZERO ATS.\nThe amended and restated certificate of designation for the Series A-1 Preferred stock provides that shares of the Series A-1 Preferred stock can be sold only on the tZERO ATS. The tZERO ATS has had limited volume. Certain broker-dealers might be unwilling to execute trades for their clients on the tZERO ATS, which could cause problems with the transfer of shares paid as part of the Dividend out of certain brokerage and retirement accounts. The unwillingness of certain broker-dealers to effectuate transfers of the Series A-1 Preferred stock on the tZERO ATS could contribute to a lack of liquidity in the Series A-1 Preferred stock on the tZERO ATS. Even if a more liquid trading market for the Series A-1 Preferred does develop on the tZERO ATS utilizing the tZERO Technology Stack or other technology developed by tZERO, the depth and liquidity of that market and the ability to sell the Series A-1 Preferred stock may nevertheless be limited, which may have a material adverse effect on the liquidity for, and the market price of, the Series A-1 Preferred stock.\nThe restrictions on the tax reporting of a holder's cost basis in shares of Series A-1 Preferred stock will not allow normal tax planning in the sale of shares of Series A-1 Preferred stock and may result in disadvantageous tax consequences to a seller of Series A-1 Preferred stock.\nOnly one method of cost basis reporting (the first-in, first-out, or \"FIFO\" method) is available for the Series A-1 Preferred stock. As a result, sellers of Series A-1 Preferred stock may be required to pay more tax on their sales or to pay taxes earlier than if other normal methods of cost basis reporting had been available, which could have an adverse tax effect on sellers of Series A-1 Preferred stock and the market price of the Series A-1 Preferred stock.\nThe record of ownership of each digital wallet address will be available to the general public and it may be possible for members of the public to determine the identity of the record holders of the Series A-1 Preferred stock.\nAlthough the record of ownership included in the blockchain is a non-controlling digital \"courtesy carbon copy\" of the records maintained by Computershare, it will be made publicly available. The publicly available information will include the digital wallet address of each holder of record transacting in Series A-1 Preferred stock and the security position information of such holder of record and the entire history of debits and credits to the relevant security position information of each digital wallet address, but it will not include any personal identifiable information. As a result, it may be possible for members of the public to determine the identity of the record holders of certain wallet addresses based on the publicly available information in the courtesy carbon copy.\nThe Series A-1 Preferred stock depends on Computershare as the transfer agent for the Series A-1 Preferred stock.\nComputershare serves as the transfer agent for the Series A-1 Preferred stock and ownership of the Series A-1 Preferred stock is determined by the books and records of Computershare. Our agreement with Computershare can be terminated by either party on 60 days' notice. If Computershare chooses to exercise its termination rights or otherwise ceases to operate as a transfer agent, we would seek to engage a successor transfer agent. In the absence of finding such a successor, Overstock would need to assume the role of transfer agent. While we believe we could successfully assume the role of transfer agent, no assurance can be given that we would be able to do so and if we are unable to do so the trading market for the Series A-1 Preferred stock would be adversely affected and it may be difficult or impossible for Overstock to pay dividends or liquidation preference or provide voting rights to the correct holders of record of the Series A-1 Preferred stock.\nTechnology on which the tZERO ATS relies for its operations may not function properly.\nThe technology on which the tZERO ATS relies, including the tZERO Technology Stack, may not function properly because of internal problems or as a result of cyber-attacks or external security breaches. Any such malfunction may adversely affect the ability of holders with a brokerage account at a tZERO ATS subscriber to execute trades of the Series A-1 Preferred stock on the tZERO ATS. If the technology used by the tZERO ATS does not work as anticipated, trading of the Series A-1 Preferred stock could be limited or even suspended. In such as case, however, our Board of Directors has the authority to change or add alternative trading systems, trading markets or venues on which the Series A-1 Preferred stock may be sold, but there can be no assurance that they will choose to do so in the future, or that any such additional trading venues would be found or prove suitable to support the Series A-1 Preferred stock.\nTransactions involving the Series A-1 Preferred stock may not be properly reflected on the blockchain.\nA significant feature of the Series A-1 Preferred stock is that, while the records of Computershare (as our transfer agent) govern record ownership of the Series A-1 Preferred stock, for all record holders on the transfer agent's official and controlling records there is a \"courtesy carbon copy\" of certain Computershare ownership records on the blockchain. Following Computershare's approval of any change in record ownership, the security position information relevant to a record holder's digital wallets addresses on the blockchain is updated consistent with changes to Computershare's official books and records. To the extent that Computershare's records and the \"courtesy carbon copy\" get out of sync, there could be a delay while we correct any such inconsistencies and such inconsistencies may cause investor confusion with respect to their record holdings of the Series A-1 Preferred stock, which could adversely affect the liquidity for, and market value of, the Series A-1 Preferred stock.\nThe potential application of U.S. laws regarding virtual currencies and money transmission to tZERO ATS, LLC's use of the Ethereum blockchain is unclear.\nThe non-controlling blockchain-based \"courtesy carbon copy\" of record ownership uses tZERO technology, which, in turn, uses the Ethereum blockchain. Although tZERO's wholly owned subsidiary, tZERO Crypto maintains certain licenses in connection with its virtual currency applications, none of the parties involved in the operation of the tZERO ATS using tZERO technology is licensed under the virtual currency or money transmission regulations of any state in the United States or registered with FinCEN. If any regulatory authority were to assert that additional licensing or registration was required by tZERO ATS, LLC or tZERO, it could affect the operations or viability of either of them, and could adversely affect the availability of the tZERO ATS as a trading venue for the Series A-1 Preferred stock. This in turn would have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of the Series A-1 Preferred stock and the holders' ability to trade such securities.\nAlthough the Series A-1 Preferred stock has characteristics similar to those of our common stock, the differences may adversely affect the trading prices of the Series A-1 Preferred stock.\nEach share of Series A-1 Preferred stock is intended to have voting and dividend rights and rights upon liquidation substantially similar to those of one share of our common stock, except that the Series A-1 Preferred stock will have a dividend preference over the common stock, the Series A-1 Preferred stock will be limited to trading on the tZERO ATS, and we will have the right to convert the Series A-1 Preferred stock into Series B Preferred stock. These provisions may have a material adverse effect on the liquidity for, and trading price of, the Series A-1 Preferred stock.\nWe do not intend to issue any additional shares of Series B Preferred stock, which is expected to continue to result in very limited trading.\nWe do not intend to issue any additional shares of Series B Preferred stock. This will likely result in limited trading in the Series B Preferred and the number of shares of Series B is limited to 370,000.\nA share of Series A-1 Preferred stock and/or Series B Preferred stock may have a substantially lower market value than a share of our common stock.\nThe trading prices of the Series A-1 Preferred stock and the Series B Preferred stock have been at times, and may be in the future, substantially lower than the trading price of our common stock, which could have a material adverse effect on holders of Series A-1 Preferred stock and holders of Series B Preferred stock.\nIt is uncertain whether the IRS will treat the Series A-1 Preferred stock and Series B Preferred stock as common stock or preferred stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nWe have been treating and intend to continue treating the Series A-1 Preferred stock and Series B Preferred stock as common stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether the IRS will treat the Series A-1 Preferred stock and Series B Preferred stock as common stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IRS were not to treat either the Series A-1 Preferred stock or the Series B Preferred stock as common stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it could have a material adverse effect on the holders of Series A-1 Preferred stock and the holders of Series B Preferred stock.\nHolders of Series A-1 Preferred stock and Series B Preferred stock will have no rights with respect to our common stock.\nHolders of Series A-1 Preferred stock and holders of the Series B Preferred stock will have no rights with respect to our common stock, and no right to convert shares of Series A-1 Preferred stock or Series B Preferred stock into shares of common stock or to exchange shares of Series A-1 Preferred stock or Series B Preferred stock for shares of common stock, except that holders of Series A-1 Preferred stock and holders of Series B Preferred stock will have the right to vote with the common stock on any matter submitted to a vote of the holders of the common stock, the right to receive payments upon liquidation equally with the holders of the common stock, and the right to receive dividends in preference to the holders of the common stock and to participate in any dividend paid to the holders of our common stock, subject to the limitations set forth in the respective certificates of designation of Series A-1 Preferred stock and Series B Preferred stock.\nOur obligation to pay dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred stock and Series B Preferred stock is limited, and our ability to pay dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred stock and Series B Preferred stock may be limited.\nOur obligation to pay preferential dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred stock is subject to our Board of Directors declaring such dividend payments. Further, although we will be contractually restricted from paying a dividend on the common stock unless we have paid preferential cumulative $0.16 per share annual dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred stock and preferential cumulative 1.0% annual dividends on the Series B Preferred stock, we have never paid a cash dividend on the common stock and we have no present intention of doing so. Consequently, our failure to pay preferential dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred stock and on the Series B Preferred stock might have no legal effect on us at all, although it could adversely affect the liquidity for, and trading prices of, the Series A-1 Preferred stock and of the Series B Preferred stock. Further, our payment of any dividends will be subject to contractual and legal restrictions and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. Moreover, agreements governing any future indebtedness of ours may further limit our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock, including the Series A-1 Preferred stock and the Series B Preferred stock. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is limited by applicable law. Although there are no arrearages in cumulative preferred dividends and we declared and paid a cash dividend of $0.16 per share to the holders of our then outstanding preferred stock during each calendar year since 2017, there is no assurance that we will be able or that our Board of Directors will decide to do so in 2022 or the future. Any of the foregoing facts or events could have a material adverse effect on the holders of the Series A-1 Preferred stock and the holders of the Series B Preferred stock and on the liquidity for, and trading prices of, the Series A-1 Preferred stock and the Series B Preferred stock.\nVoting rights on the Series A-1 Preferred stock and Series B Preferred stock are generally limited to voting together with the holders of the common stock and Series A-1 Preferred stock or Series B Preferred stock as a single class, and the holders of the Series A-1 Preferred stock and the holders of the Series B Preferred stock collectively would have only a small percentage of the voting power in connection with any such vote.\nVoting rights of the Series A-1 Preferred stock and Series B Preferred stock are generally limited to voting together with the holders of the common stock, Series A-1 Preferred stock and Series B Preferred stock, as a single class. Accordingly, if an amendment requiring stockholder approval is proposed to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, except in certain circumstances, neither the holders of the Series A-1 Preferred stock nor the holders of the Series B Preferred stock will be entitled to a class vote on the amendment. These limited voting rights could have a material adverse effect on holders of Series A-1 Preferred stock and holders of Series B Preferred stock and on the trading prices of the Series A-1 Preferred stock and the Series B Preferred stock.\nThe holders of the Series A-1 Preferred stock and Series B Preferred stock will have no right as a separate class to elect any members of our Board of Directors under any circumstances. Further, the holders of the Series A-1 Preferred stock and the holders of the Series B Preferred stock, together, also will have no right by themselves to elect any members of our Board of Directors under any circumstances. Lack of such rights could have a material adverse effect on holders of the Series A-1 and Series B Preferred stock and the liquidity for, and trading prices of, the Series A-1 and Series B Preferred stock.\nThe Series A-1 Preferred stock and the Series B Preferred stock will rank junior to all of our liabilities in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up of our business.\nIn the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up, our assets will be available to make payments to holders of Series A-1 Preferred stock and to holders of Series B Preferred stock only after all of our liabilities have been paid, and neither the Series A-1 Preferred stock nor the Series B Preferred stock will have any preference over our common stock in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up. In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up, there may not be sufficient assets remaining, after paying our liabilities, to pay any amounts to the holders of Series A-1 Preferred stock or Series B Preferred stock then outstanding. Any bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up of our company would have a material adverse effect on the liquidity for, and trading prices of, the Series A-1 Preferred stock and Series B Preferred stock.", "PERMNO": 89394, "SIC": 5961, "TIC": "OSTK"}
