{"cik": "1358071", "company": "CONCHO RESOURCES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should consider carefully the following risk factors together with all of the other information included in this report and other reports filed with the SEC before investing in our securities. If any of the following risks were actually to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOil, natural gas and natural gas liquid prices are volatile and continued to decline significantly during 2015, with sustained lower prices through 2016. An extended continuation of, or a further decline in, oil, natural gas and natural gas liquid prices could adversely affect our financial position, financial results, cash flow, access to capital and ability to grow.\nOur future financial condition, revenues, results of operations, rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend primarily upon the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production and the prices prevailing from time to time for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquid prices historically have been volatile, and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future, especially given current geopolitical conditions. This price volatility also affects the amount of cash flow we have available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. The prices and levels of production for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are subject to a variety of factors beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7 the level of consumer demand for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids;\n\u00b7 the domestic and foreign supply of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids;\n\u00b7 inventory levels of Cushing, Oklahoma, the benchmark for WTI oil prices;\n\u00b7 liquefied natural gas deliveries to and from the United States;\n\u00b7 commodity processing, gathering and transportation availability and the availability of refining capacity;\n\u00b7 the price and level of imports of foreign oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7 the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil exporting nations to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;\n\u00b7 domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;\n\u00b7 the price and availability of alternative fuel sources;\n\u00b7 weather conditions;\n\u00b7 political conditions or hostilities in oil and natural gas producing regions, including the Middle East, Africa and South America;\n\u00b7 technological advances affecting energy consumption and energy supply;\n\u00b7 effect of energy conservation efforts;\n\u00b7 variations between product prices at sales points and applicable index prices; and\n\u00b7 worldwide economic conditions.\nFurthermore, oil and natural gas prices continued to be volatile in 2016. For example, the NYMEX oil prices in 2016 ranged from a high of $54.06 to a low of $26.21 per Bbl and the NYMEX natural gas prices in 2016 ranged from a high of $3.93 to a low of $1.64 per MMBtu. Further, the NYMEX oil prices and NYMEX natural gas prices reached lows of $50.82 per Bbl and $2.83 per MMBtu, respectively, during the period from January 1, 2017 to February 17, 2017.\nDeclines in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquid prices would not only reduce our revenue, but could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically. This in turn would lower the amount of oil and natural gas reserves we could recognize and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If the oil and natural gas industry continues to experience significant price declines, we may, among other things, be unable to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity, repay current or future indebtedness or obtain additional capital on attractive terms, all of which can adversely affect the value of our securities.\nApproximately 35.3 percent of our total estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2016 were undeveloped, and those reserves may not ultimately be developed.\nAt December 31, 2016, approximately 35.3 percent of our total estimated proved reserves were undeveloped. Recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling. Our reserve data assumes that we can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully. These assumptions, however, may not prove correct. Our reserve report at December 31, 2016 includes estimates of total future development costs over the next five years associated with our proved undeveloped reserves of approximately $2.1 billion. If we choose not to spend the capital to develop these reserves, or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop these reserves, we will be required to write-off these reserves. In addition, under the SEC\u2019s reserve rules, because proved undeveloped reserves may be booked only if they relate to wells planned to be drilled within five years of the date of booking, we may be required to write-off any proved undeveloped reserves that are not developed within this five-year timeframe. For example, as of December 31, 2016, we wrote-off approximately 57.4 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves because they are no longer expected to be developed within five years of their initial recording. Any such write-offs of our reserves could reduce our ability to borrow money and could reduce the value of our securities.\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high-risk activities with many uncertainties that could cause our costs to increase or production volumes to decrease, which would reduce our cash flows.\nOur future financial condition and results of operations will depend on the success of our exploration and production activities. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil or natural gas production. Our decisions to purchase, explore, develop or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. Our cost of drilling, completing, equipping and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences. Overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical or less economical than forecasted. Further, many factors may curtail, delay or cancel drilling, including the following:\n\u00b7 delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory and contractual requirements;\n\u00b7 reductions in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquid prices;\n\u00b7 pressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u00b7 shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel or in obtaining water for hydraulic fracturing activities;\n\u00b7 equipment failures or accidents;\n\u00b7 adverse weather conditions;\n\u00b7 political events, public protests, civil disturbances, terrorist acts or cyber attacks;\n\u00b7 environmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, encountering naturally occurring radioactive materials, and unauthorized discharges of brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, toxic gases or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment;\n\u00b7 limited availability of financing at acceptable terms;\n\u00b7 surface access restrictions;\n\u00b7 loss of title or other title related issues;\n\u00b7 oil, natural gas liquids or natural gas gathering, transportation and processing availability restrictions or limitations; and\n\u00b7 limitations in the market for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.\nProlonged decreases in our drilling program may require us to pay certain non-use fees or impact our ability to comply with certain contractual requirements.\nOil prices declined substantially during the second half of 2014 and continued to decline through 2015 with sustained lower prices through 2016. In the event that oil and natural gas prices remain depressed for a sustained period, or continue to further decline, we may experience significant decreases in drilling activity. Due to the nature of our drilling programs and the oil and natural gas industry generally, we are a party to certain agreements that require us to meet various contractual obligations or require us to utilize a certain amount of goods or services, including, but not limited to, water commitments, throughput volume commitments, power commitments and drilling commitments. In the event that oil and natural gas prices remain depressed, and as a result continue to reduce the demand for drilling and production, this could lead to a decrease in our drilling activity and production levels, which could, in turn, require us to pay for unutilized goods or services or impact our ability to meet these contractual obligations.\nWe may incur losses as a result of title defects in our oil and natural gas properties.\nIt is our practice to initially conduct only a cursory title review of the oil and natural gas properties on which we do not have proved reserves. To the extent title opinions or other investigations prior to our commencement of drilling operations reflect defects affecting such properties, we are typically responsible for curing any such defects at our expense. Additionally, the discovery of any such defects could delay or prohibit the commencement of drilling operations on the affected properties. These impacts and other potential losses resulting from title defects in our oil and natural gas properties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal, state and local legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing, as well as governmental reviews of such activities, could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays and adversely affect our production.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations. We routinely utilize hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our drilling and completion programs. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, the EPA recently asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the SDWA\u2019s Underground Injection Control Program and issued guidance in February 2014, governing such activities. The EPA has also issued: final regulations under the CAA establishing performance standards, including standards for the capture of VOCs and methane released during hydraulic fracturing; an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing; and final rules in June 2016 to prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. In addition, the BLM finalized rules in March 2015 that impose new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands. The United States District Court of Wyoming has temporarily stayed implementation of this rule. A final decision has not yet been issued.\nAt the state level, several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure, and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. For example, New Mexico and Texas have adopted hydraulic fracturing fluid disclosure requirements, and the RRC has also adopted rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. In addition, local governments have also taken steps to regulate hydraulic fracturing, including imposing restrictions or moratoria on oil and gas activities occurring within their boundaries. If new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.\nIn addition, certain governmental reviews are either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of\nhydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that \u201cwater cycle\u201d activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under some circumstances, noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local- or regional-scale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts: water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. Since the report did not find a direct link between hydraulic fracturing itself and contamination of groundwater resources, this years-long study report does not appear to provide any basis for further regulation of hydraulic fracturing at the federal level.\nIf new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing becomes regulated at the federal level as a result of federal legislation or regulatory initiatives by the EPA, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting requirements and could also result in permitting delays and potential cost increases. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves.\nOur operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water. Restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWater is an essential component of both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Historically, we have been able to purchase water from local land owners and other sources for use in our operations. Over the past few years, extreme drought conditions persisted in West Texas and Southeast New Mexico. Although conditions have improved, we cannot guarantee what conditions may occur in the future. Severe drought conditions can result in local water districts taking steps to restrict the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for drilling and hydraulic fracturing in order to protect the local water supply. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, we may be unable to economically produce oil and natural gas, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nEstimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows are not precise. The actual quantities of our proved reserves and our future net cash flows may prove to be lower than estimated.\nNumerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net cash flows therefrom. Our estimates of proved reserves and related future net cash flows are based on various assumptions, which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate.\nPetroleum engineering is a subjective process of estimating accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, including the following:\n\u00b7 historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas;\n\u00b7 the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies;\n\u00b7 the quality, quantity and interpretation of available relevant data;\n\u00b7 assumptions concerning future commodity prices; and\n\u00b7 assumptions concerning future operating costs; severance, ad valorem and excise taxes; development costs; and workover and remedial costs.\nBecause all reserve estimates are to some degree subjective, each of the following items, or other items not identified below, may differ materially from those assumed in estimating reserves:\n\u00b7 the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered;\n\u00b7 the production and operating costs incurred;\n\u00b7 the amount and timing of future development expenditures; and\n\u00b7 future commodity prices.\nFurthermore, different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same data. Our actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely be different from estimates and the differences may be material.\nAs required by the SEC, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on the average previous twelve months first-of-month prices preceding the date of the estimate and costs as of the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. Actual future net cash flows also will be affected by factors such as:\n\u00b7 the amount and timing of actual production;\n\u00b7 levels of future capital spending;\n\u00b7 increases or decreases in the supply of or demand for oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas; and\n\u00b7 changes in governmental regulations or taxation.\nAccordingly, estimates included herein of future net cash flows may be materially different from the future net cash flows that are ultimately received. Therefore, the estimates of discounted future net cash flows in this report should not be construed as accurate estimates of the current market value of our proved reserves.\nOur business requires substantial capital expenditures. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all, which could lead to a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves. At December 31, 2016, we had no outstanding debt under our credit facility (and total debt at December 31, 2016 was $2.7 billion), and we had approximately $2.5 billion of unused commitments under our credit facility. Expenditures for acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties are the primary use of our capital resources. We incurred approximately $3.3 billion in acquisition, exploration and development activities (excluding asset retirement obligations) during the year ended December 31, 2016. In February 2017, we announced our updated 2017 capital budget, excluding acquisitions, of approximately $1.8 billion with expected capital spending to range between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion. Approximately 90 percent of capital will be directed to drilling and completion activity. Our 2017 capital program is expected to continue focusing on extended length lateral drilling. Our 2017 capital budget, based on our current expectations of commodity prices and costs, is expected to be within our cash flows. Our budget could change depending on numerous factors, including commodity prices, leverage metrics and industry conditions. We plan to spend approximately $2.1 billion over the next five years on future development costs associated with proved undeveloped reserves.\nWe intend to finance our future capital expenditures, other than significant acquisitions, through cash flow from operations and through borrowings under our credit facility; however, our financing needs may require us to alter or increase our capitalization substantially through the issuance of debt or equity securities. The issuance of additional equity securities could have a dilutive effect on the value of our common stock. Additional borrowings under our credit facility or the issuance of additional debt securities will require that a greater portion of our cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest and principal on our debt, thereby reducing our ability to use cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. In addition, our credit facility imposes certain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness other than indebtedness under our credit facility. If we desire to issue additional debt securities other than as expressly permitted under our credit facility, we will be required to seek the consent of the lenders in accordance with the requirements of the credit facility, which consent may be withheld by the lenders at their discretion. If we incur certain additional indebtedness, our borrowing base under our credit facility may be reduced. Additional financing also may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. In the event additional capital resources are unavailable, we may curtail drilling, development and other activities or be forced to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis.\nOur cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u00b7 our proved reserves;\n\u00b7 the level of oil and natural gas we are able to produce from existing wells;\n\u00b7 the prices at which our commodities are sold;\n\u00b7 the costs of producing oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7 global credit and securities markets;\n\u00b7 the ability and willingness of lenders and investors to provide capital and the cost of the capital;\n\u00b7 our ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves; and\n\u00b7 the impact of potential changes in our credit ratings.\nIf our revenues or the borrowing base under our credit facility decrease as a result of lower commodity prices or sustained depressed commodity prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves, lending requirements or regulations, or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current or anticipated levels. As a result, we may require additional capital to fund our operations, and we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all, to satisfy our capital requirements. If cash generated from operations or borrowings available under our credit facility is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to the development of our prospects, which in turn could lead to a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves, and could adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations.\nDeclining general economic, business or industry conditions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn recent years, the global economic downturn, particularly with respect to the U.S. economy, and the global financial and credit market disruptions have reduced the availability of liquidity and credit to fund the continuation and expansion of industrial business operations worldwide resulting in a slowdown in economic activity. This has reduced worldwide demand for energy and resulted in lower commodity prices.\nLower commodity prices will reduce our cash flows and borrowing ability. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a decline in our reserves as existing reserves are depleted. Lower commodity prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically, which could ultimately decrease our net revenue and profitability.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes could be limited.\nWe generated a $477.7 million net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) in 2016. Utilization of this NOL depends on many factors, including our ability to generate future taxable income, which cannot be assured. In addition, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cSection 382\u201d), generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of NOLs that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone an \u201cownership change\u201d (as determined under Section 382). An ownership change generally occurs if one or more stockholders (or groups of stockholders) who are each deemed to own at least five percent of our stock change their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. In the event that an ownership change has occurred, or were to occur, utilization of our NOLs would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382, determined by multiplying the value of our equity at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate as defined in Section 382, and potentially increased for certain gains recognized within five years after the ownership change if we have a net built-in gain in our assets at the time of the ownership change. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years. We do not believe that an ownership change has occurred as a result of our recent equity offerings or our issuance of shares in connection with various acquisitions. As such, Section 382 was not expected to limit our ability to utilize our NOL carryforward or any other tax attribute as of December 31, 2016. Future ownership changes or future regulatory changes could limit our ability to utilize our NOLs. To the extent we are not able to offset our future income with our NOLs, this could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows once we attain profitability.\nWe have substantial indebtedness and may incur substantially more debt. Higher levels of indebtedness make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business.\nWe had approximately $2.7 billion of outstanding debt at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, the borrowing base under our credit facility was $2.8 billion and commitments from our bank group were $2.5 billion, of which $2.5 billion was unused commitments.\nAs a result of our indebtedness, we will need to use a portion of our cash flow to pay interest, which will reduce the amount we will have available to fund our operations and other business activities and could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate. Our indebtedness under our credit facility is at a variable interest rate, and so a rise in interest rates will generate greater interest expense to the extent we do not have applicable interest rate fluctuation hedges. The amount of our debt may also cause us to be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business.\nWe may incur substantially more debt in the future. The indentures governing our senior notes contain restrictions on our incurrence of additional indebtedness. These restrictions, however, are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, we could incur substantial additional indebtedness in compliance with these restrictions. Moreover, these restrictions do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under the indentures.\nAny increase in our level of indebtedness could have adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations, including imposing additional cash requirements on us in order to support interest payments, increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate and other purposes.\nIf we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness, there could be a default under the terms of these agreements, which could result in an acceleration of payment of funds that we have borrowed.\nOur ability to meet our debt obligations and other expenses will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors, many of which we are unable to control. If our cash flow is not sufficient to service our debt, we may be required to refinance debt, sell assets or sell additional equity on terms that we may not find attractive if it may be done at all. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the agreements governing our indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default:\n\u00b7 the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest;\n\u00b7 the lenders under our credit facility could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets; and\n\u00b7 we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nIf our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to obtain waivers under our credit facility to avoid being in default. If we breach our covenants under our credit facility and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If this occurs, we would be in default under our credit facility, the lenders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nOur lenders can limit our borrowing capabilities, which may materially impact our operations.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had no debt outstanding under our credit facility, and our borrowing base was $2.8 billion and commitments from our bank group were $2.5 billion. The borrowing base under our credit facility is redetermined annually based upon a number of factors, including commodity prices and reserve levels. In addition, between redeterminations we and, if requested by 66 2/3 percent of our lenders, our lenders, may each request one special redetermination. Upon a redetermination, our borrowing base could be substantially reduced, and in the event the amount outstanding under our credit facility at any time exceeds the borrowing base at such time, we may be required to repay a\nportion of our outstanding borrowings. We expect to utilize cash on hand, cash flow from operations, bank borrowings, debt and equity financings and asset sales to fund our acquisition, exploration and development activities. A reduction in our borrowing base could limit our activities. In addition, we may significantly alter our capitalization in order to make future acquisitions or develop our properties. These changes in capitalization may significantly increase our level of indebtedness. If we incur additional debt for these or other purposes, the related risks that we now face could intensify. A higher level of indebtedness also increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance which is affected by general economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nA downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital.\nWe receive debt credit ratings from S&P Global Ratings (\u201cS&P\u201d) and Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d), which are subject to regular reviews. At December 31, 2016, our long-term debt was rated \u201cBB+\u201d by S&P with an outlook that was raised from stable to positive in August 2016. Moody\u2019s corporate rating for us is \u201cBa1\u201d with a stable outlook. S&P and Moody\u2019s consider many factors in determining our ratings including: the industry in which we operate, production growth opportunities, liquidity, debt levels and asset and reserve mix. A reduction in our debt ratings could negatively affect our ability to obtain financing or the interest rate, fees and other terms associated with such additional financing.\nA downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively impact our costs of capital and our ability to effectively execute aspects of our strategy. Further, a downgrade in our credit ratings could affect our ability to raise debt in the public debt markets, and the cost of any new debt could be much higher than our outstanding debt. These and other impacts of a downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of the filing of this report, no additional changes in our credit ratings have occurred; however, we cannot be assured that our credit ratings will not be downgraded in the future.\nOur operations expose us to significant costs and liabilities with respect to environmental and operational safety matters.\nWe may incur significant delays, costs and liabilities as a result of environmental, occupational health and safety requirements applicable to our oil and natural gas exploration, development and production, and related saltwater disposal activities. These delays, costs and liabilities could arise under a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, occupational health and safety, including regulations and enforcement policies that have tended to become increasingly strict over time. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens, and, in some instances, issuance of orders or injunctions limiting or requiring discontinuation of certain operations. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations.\nStrict as well as joint and several liability for a variety of environmental costs may be imposed on us under certain environmental laws, which could cause us to become liable for the conduct of others or for consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. New laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be more stringent and impose unforeseen liabilities or significantly increase compliance costs. No assurance can be given that continued compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations will not result in a curtailment of production or processing activities or result in a material increase in the costs of production, development, exploration or processing operations. If we are not able to recover the resulting costs through insurance or increased revenues, our production, revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur producing properties are concentrated in the Permian Basin of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area. In addition, we have a large amount of proved reserves attributable to a small number of producing horizons within this area.\nOur producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Permian Basin of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. At December 31, 2016, substantially all of our total estimated proved reserves were attributable to properties located in this area. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, severe weather events, water shortages or other drought related conditions or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil, natural gas or natural gas liquids.\nIn addition to the geographic concentration of our producing properties described above, at December 31, 2016, approximately: (i) 32 percent of our proved reserves were attributable to the Avalon Shale, Bone Spring and Wolfcamp formations located in the Northern Delaware Basin; (ii) 15 percent of our proved reserves were attributable to the Bone Spring and Wolfcamp formations located in the Southern Delaware Basin; (iii) 26 percent of our proved reserves were attributable to the Wolfcamp and Spraberry formations in the Midland Basin; and (iv) 24 percent of our proved reserves were attributable to the Yeso formation, which includes both the Paddock and Blinebry intervals, underlying our oil and natural gas properties located in Southeast New Mexico. This concentration of assets within a small number of producing horizons exposes us to additional risks, such as changes in field-wide rules and regulations that could cause us to permanently or temporarily shut-in all of our wells within a field.\nWe periodically assess our unproved oil and natural gas properties for impairment and could be required to recognize non-cash charges to earnings of future periods.\nAt December 31, 2016, we carried unproved property costs of $1.9 billion. GAAP requires periodic assessment of these costs on a project-by-project basis. Our assessment considers future drilling and exploration plans, results of exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales, expiration of all or a portion of the projects, contracts and permits relevant to such projects. Based on our assessments, we may determine that we are unable to fully recover the cost invested in each project, and we will recognize non-cash charges to earnings in future periods if such determination is made.\nFuture price declines could result in a reduction in the carrying value of our proved oil and natural gas properties, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nDeclines in commodity prices may result in us having to make substantial downward adjustments to the value of our estimated proved reserves. If this occurs, or if our estimates of production or economic factors change, accounting rules may require us to write-down, as a non-cash charge to earnings, the carrying value of our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairments. We are required to perform impairment tests on proved assets whenever events or changes in circumstances warrant a review of our proved oil and natural gas properties. To the extent such tests indicate a reduction of the estimated useful life or estimated future cash flows of our oil and natural gas properties, the carrying value may not be recoverable and therefore require a write-down. The primary factors that may affect management\u2019s estimates of future cash flows are (i) commodity futures prices, (ii) increases or decreases in production and capital costs, (iii) future reserve volume adjustments, both positive and negative, to proved reserves and appropriate risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, (iv) results of future drilling activities and (v) prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets. We may incur impairment charges in the future, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations in the period incurred. We estimate that if the oil and natural gas prices used in this analysis would have been approximately 10 percent lower as of December 31, 2016 with no other changes in capital costs, operating costs, price differentials, or reserve volumes, no impairment would be indicated.\nOther assumptions such as operating costs, well and reservoir performance, severance and ad valorem taxes, and operating and development plans would likely change given a change in oil and natural gas prices. However, we are unable to estimate the correlation between these assumptions and any estimated commodity price change, and these and other assumptions may worsen or partially mitigate some of the effects of a reduction in commodity prices, including the ultimate impact and amount of any potential impairment charge.\nPart of our strategy involves exploratory drilling, including drilling in new or emerging plays. As a result, our drilling results in these areas are uncertain, and the value of our undeveloped acreage will decline if drilling results are unsuccessful.\nThe results of our exploratory drilling in new or emerging plays are more uncertain than drilling results in areas that are developed and have established production. Since new or emerging plays and new formations have limited or no production history, we are unable to use past drilling results in those areas to help predict our future drilling results. As a result, our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells in these areas may be higher than initially expected, and the value of our undeveloped acreage will decline if drilling results are unsuccessful.\nOur commodity price risk management program may cause us to forego additional future profits or result in our making cash payments to our counterparties.\nTo reduce our exposure to changes in the prices of commodities, we have entered into and may in the future enter into additional commodity price risk management arrangements for a portion of our oil and natural gas production. The agreements that we have entered into generally have the effect of providing us with a fixed price for a portion of our expected future oil and natural gas production over a fixed period of time. Commodity price risk management arrangements expose us\nto the risk of financial loss and may limit our ability to benefit from increases in commodity prices in some circumstances, including the following:\n\u00b7 the counterparty to a commodity price risk management contract may default on its contractual obligations to us;\n\u00b7 there may be a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in a commodity price risk management agreement and actual prices received; or\n\u00b7 market prices may exceed the prices which we are contracted to receive, resulting in our need to make significant cash payments to our counterparties.\nOur commodity price risk management activities could have the effect of reducing our net income and the value of our securities. At December 31, 2016, we had a net derivative liability of approximately $174.4 million. An average increase in the commodity price of $5.00 per barrel of oil and $0.50 per MMBtu for natural gas from the commodity price at December 31, 2016 would have resulted in an increase in our net liability of approximately $249.6 million. We may continue to incur significant gains or losses in the future from our commodity price risk management activities to the extent market prices increase or decrease and our derivatives contracts remain in place.\nOur identified inventory of drilling locations and recompletion opportunities are scheduled out over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.\nWe have identified and scheduled the drilling of certain locations as an estimation of our future multi-year development activities on our existing acreage. These identified locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including: (i) our ability to timely drill wells on lands subject to complex development terms and circumstances; (ii) the availability of capital, equipment, services and qualified personnel; (iii) weather conditions; (iv) regulatory and third-party approvals; (v) commodity prices; (vi) access to and availability of water sourcing and distribution systems; and (vii) drilling and recompletion costs and results. Additionally, changes in the laws or regulations on which we rely in planning and executing our drilling programs could adversely impact our ability to successfully complete those programs. Because of these and other potential uncertainties, we may never drill the potential locations we have identified or produce oil or natural gas from these or any other potential locations. As such, our actual development activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations.\nUnless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our cash flow, our ability to raise capital and the value of our securities.\nUnless we conduct successful development and exploration activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Producing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production, and therefore our cash flow and results of operations, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. The value of our securities and our ability to raise capital will be adversely impacted if we are not able to replace our reserves that are depleted by production. We may not be able to develop, exploit, find or acquire sufficient additional reserves to replace our current and future production.\nThe Standardized Measure of our estimated reserves is not an accurate estimate of the current fair value of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves.\nStandardized Measure is a reporting convention that provides a common basis for comparing oil and natural gas companies subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC. This measure requires the use of operating and development costs prevailing as of the date of computation. Consequently, it will not reflect the prices ordinarily received or that will be received for oil and natural gas production because of varying market conditions, nor may it reflect the actual costs that will be required to produce or develop the oil and natural gas properties. Accordingly, estimates included herein of future net cash flows may be materially different from the future net cash flows that are ultimately received. In addition, the 10 percent discount factor, which is required by the rules and regulations of the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with our company or the oil and natural gas industry in general. Therefore, Standardized Measure included in this report should not be construed as an accurate estimate of the current fair value of our proved reserves.\nOur reserve estimates and our computation of future net cash flows are based on SEC pricing of (i) $39.25 per Bbl WTI posted oil price and (ii) $2.48 per MMBtu Henry Hub spot natural gas price, adjusted for location and quality by property. The SEC pricing for reserves as of December 31, 2016 is lower than the NYMEX oil price and NYMEX natural gas price of $53.40 per Bbl and $2.83 per MMBtu, respectively, at February 17, 2017. If average oil prices were $5.00 per barrel lower than the average price we used, our proved reserves at December 31, 2016 would have decreased from 720.0 MMBoe to 705.7 MMBoe. If average natural gas prices were $0.50 per MMBtu lower than the average price we used, our proved reserves at December 31, 2016 would have decreased from 720.0 MMBoe to 709.8 MMBoe. Any adjustments to the estimates of proved reserves or decreases in the price of our commodities may decrease the value of our securities.\nWe may be unable to make attractive acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired companies or assets, and any inability to do so may disrupt our business and hinder our ability to grow.\nOne aspect of our business strategy calls for acquisitions of businesses or assets that complement or expand our current business. We may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. Even if we do identify attractive candidates, we may not be able to complete the acquisition of them or do so on commercially acceptable terms.\nIn addition, our credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes impose certain limitations on our ability to enter into mergers or combination transactions. Our credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes also limit our ability to incur certain indebtedness, which could indirectly limit our ability to engage in acquisitions of businesses or assets. If we desire to engage in an acquisition that is otherwise prohibited by our credit facility or the indentures governing our senior notes, we will be required to seek the consent of our lenders or the holders of the senior notes in accordance with the requirements of the credit facility or the indentures, which consent may be withheld by the lenders under our credit facility or such holders of senior notes at their sole discretion.\nIf we acquire another business or assets, we could have difficulty integrating its operations, systems, management and other personnel and technology with our own. These difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we may incur additional debt or issue additional equity to pay for any future acquisitions, subject to the limitations described above.\nAny acquisition we complete is subject to substantial risks that could adversely affect our business, including the risk that our acquisitions may prove to be worth less than what we paid because of uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and could expose us to potentially significant liabilities.\nWe obtained a significant portion of our current reserve base through acquisitions of producing properties and undeveloped acreage. We expect that acquisitions will continue to contribute to our future growth. In connection with these and potential future acquisitions, we are often only able to perform limited due diligence. The success of any acquisition involves potential risks, including among other things:\n\u00b7 the inability to estimate accurately the costs to develop the reserves, recoverable volumes of reserves, rates of future production and future net cash flows attainable from the reserves;\n\u00b7 the assumption of unknown liabilities, including environmental liabilities, and losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which the indemnity we receive is inadequate;\n\u00b7 the effect on our liquidity or financial leverage of using available cash or debt to finance acquisitions;\n\u00b7 the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns; and\n\u00b7 an inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate our growing business and assets.\nSuccessful acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties require an assessment of a number of factors, including estimates of recoverable reserves, the timing of recovering reserves, exploration potential, future commodity prices, operating costs and potential environmental, regulatory and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact, and we cannot make these assessments with a high degree of accuracy. In connection with our assessments, we perform a review of the acquired properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. However, such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems. In addition, our review may not permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their\ndeficiencies and capabilities. We do not inspect every well. Even when we inspect a well, we do not always discover structural, subsurface and environmental problems that may exist or arise.\nThere may be threatened, contemplated, asserted or other claims against the acquired assets related to environmental, title, regulatory, tax, contract, litigation or other matters of which we are unaware, which could materially and adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations. We are sometimes able to obtain contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities, including environmental liabilities, but we generally acquire interests in properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties. In addition, even when we are able to obtain such indemnification from the sellers, these indemnification obligations usually expire over time and expose us to potential unindemnified liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations.\nShortages of oilfield equipment, services and qualified personnel could delay our drilling program and increase the prices we pay to obtain such equipment, services and personnel.\nThe demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with commodity prices, causing periodic shortages. Historically, there have been shortages of drilling and workover rigs, pipe and other oilfield equipment as demand for rigs and equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled. These factors also cause significant increases in costs for equipment, services and personnel. Higher commodity prices generally stimulate demand and result in increased prices for drilling and workover rigs, crews and associated supplies, equipment and services. It is beyond our control and ability to predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and, if so, what their timing and duration will be. These types of shortages or price increases would decrease our profit margin, cash flow and operating results, or restrict our ability to drill the wells and conduct the operations which we currently have planned and budgeted or which we may plan in the future.\nOur exploration and development drilling may not result in commercially productive reserves.\nDrilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that commercially productive reservoirs will not be encountered. New wells that we drill may not be productive, or we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells. The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or may be produced economically. Drilling for oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable results, not only from dry holes but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a profit at then realized prices after deducting drilling, operating and other costs. The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. Further, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including:\n\u00b7 unexpected drilling conditions;\n\u00b7 title problems;\n\u00b7 pressure or irregularities in formations;\n\u00b7 equipment failures or accidents;\n\u00b7 fracture stimulation accidents or failures;\n\u00b7 adverse weather conditions;\n\u00b7 compliance with environmental and other governmental or contractual requirements; and\n\u00b7 increases in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, electricity, water, supplies, materials, drilling or workover rigs, equipment and services.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and natural gas operations. In addition, we may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\nWe are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our oil and natural gas exploration\nand production activities, including well stimulation and completion activities such as hydraulic fracturing, are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including the possibility of:\n\u00b7 environmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater contamination;\n\u00b7 abnormally pressured or structured formations;\n\u00b7 mechanical difficulties, such as stuck oilfield drilling and service tools and casing collapse;\n\u00b7 blowouts, cratering, fires, explosions and ruptures of pipelines;\n\u00b7 personal injuries and death; and\n\u00b7 natural disasters.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us as a result of:\n\u00b7 injury or loss of life;\n\u00b7 damage to and destruction of property and equipment;\n\u00b7 damage to natural resources due to underground migration of hydraulic fracturing fluids;\n\u00b7 pollution and other environmental damage, including spillage or mishandling of recovered hydraulic fracturing fluids;\n\u00b7 regulatory investigations and penalties;\n\u00b7 suspension of our operations; and\n\u00b7 repair and remediation costs.\nWe may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event that is not covered or not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to acquire properties, market oil and natural gas and secure trained personnel.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing oil and natural gas and securing trained personnel. Some of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours, which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. In addition, those companies may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer. The cost to attract and retain qualified personnel may increase substantially in the future. Our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital. Our failure to acquire properties, market oil and natural gas and secure trained personnel and adequately compensate personnel could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations.\nMarket conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production.\nMarket conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas processing or transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil, natural gas and natural gas liquid markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities, competition for such facilities and the inability of such facilities to gather, transport or process our production due to shutdowns or curtailments arising from mechanical, operational or weather related matters, including hurricanes and other severe weather conditions. Our ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering and transportation systems, pipelines and processing facilities owned and operated by third parties. Our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be required to shut in or otherwise curtail production from wells due to lack of a market or inadequacy or unavailability of oil, natural gas liquid or natural gas pipeline or gathering, transportation or processing capacity. If that were to occur, then we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until suitable arrangements were made to market our production.\nWe are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, timing, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or that may subject us to fines or penalties for any failure to comply.\nOur oil and natural gas exploration, development and production, and related saltwater disposal operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations. In order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state, local and governmental authorities. We may incur substantial costs and experience delays in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with the existing laws and regulations, we may incur additional costs, including fines and penalties, in order to come back into compliance. In addition, our costs of compliance may increase or our operations may be otherwise adversely affected if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted or if the government agencies responsible for enforcing certain existing laws and regulations applicable to us change their priorities or policies, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. These and other costs could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations.\nCertain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nIn past years, legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws, including to certain key U.S. federal income tax provisions currently available to oil and gas companies. Such legislative changes have included, but not been limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. The new President and certain members of Congress are calling for U.S. federal tax reform, and Congress could consider, and could include, some or all of these proposals as part of tax reform legislation, to accompany lower federal income tax rates. Moreover, other more general features of tax reform legislation, including changes to cost recovery rules and to the deductibility of interest expense, may be developed that also would change the taxation of oil and gas companies. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could take effect. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that currently are available with respect to oil and gas development, or increase costs, and any such changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the crude oil and natural gas that we produce.\nIn response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has issued regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. These regulations include limits on tailpipe emissions from motor vehicles and preconstruction and operating permit requirements for certain large stationary sources. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the United States, as well as certain onshore oil and natural gas production facilities, on an annual basis, including GHG emissions resulting from the completion and workover operations of hydraulically fractured oil wells. Recent federal regulatory action with respect to climate change has focused on methane emissions. For example, in June 2016, the EPA finalized new air emission controls for emissions of methane from certain\nequipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities. The final rule package includes first-time standards to address emissions of methane from equipment and processes across the source category, including hydraulically fractured oil and natural gas well completions, and also imposes leak detection and repair requirements on operators. The BLM finalized similar rules in November 2016 that limit methane emissions from new and existing oil and gas operations on federal lands through limitations on the venting and flaring of gas, as well as enhanced leak detection and repair requirements. The BLM adopted the final rules in January 2017; however, operators generally have one year from the January 2017 effective date to come into compliance with the rule\u2019s requirements. These methane emission rules have the potential to increase our compliance costs.\nWhile Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs in recent years. In the absence of Congressional action, many states have established GHG cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and natural gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall GHG emission reduction goal.\nThe adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or to comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Reduced demand for the oil and gas that we produce could also have the effect of lowering the value of our reserves. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe adoption of derivatives legislation by Congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.\nCongress adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, including us, which participate in that market. This legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), became law on July 21, 2010 and requires the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d) and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the Act. Although the CFTC has finalized certain regulations, others remain to be finalized or implemented and it is not possible at this time to predict when this will be accomplished.\nIn October 2011, the CFTC issued regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. The initial position limits rule was vacated by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2012. However, in November 2013, the CFTC proposed new rules that would place limits on positions in certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts for or linked to certain physical commodities, subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions. As these new position limit rules are not yet final, the impact of those provisions on us is uncertain at this time.\nThe CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing and the associated rules also will require us, in connection with covered derivative activities, to comply with clearing and trade-execution requirements or take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements. The CFTC has not yet proposed rules designating any other classes of swaps, including physical commodity swaps, for mandatory clearing. Although we expect to qualify for the end-user exception from the mandatory clearing requirements for swaps entered to hedge our commercial risks, the application of the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging. If our swaps do not qualify for the commercial end-user exception, or if the cost of entering into uncleared swaps becomes prohibitive, we may be required to clear such transactions. The ultimate effect of the rules and any additional regulations on our business is uncertain at this time.\nIn addition, certain banking regulators and the CFTC have adopted final rules establishing minimum margin requirements for uncleared swaps. Although we expect to qualify for the end-user exception from such margin requirements for swaps entered into to hedge our commercial risks, the application of such requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging. If any of our swaps do not qualify\nfor the commercial end-user exception, the posting of collateral could reduce our liquidity and cash available for capital expenditures and our ability to manage commodity price volatility and the volatility in cash flows. The impact of those provisions is uncertain at this time.\nThe full impact of the Act and related regulatory requirements upon our business will not be known until the regulations are implemented and the market for derivatives contracts has adjusted. The Act and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, or reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Act and regulations implementing the Act, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of commodity prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the Act and implementing regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition and our results of operations.\nThe loss of our chief executive officer or other key personnel could negatively impact our ability to execute our business strategy.\nWe depend, and will continue to depend in the foreseeable future, on the services of our chief executive officer, Timothy A. Leach, and other officers and key employees who have extensive experience and expertise in evaluating and analyzing producing oil and natural gas properties and drilling prospects, maximizing production from oil and natural gas properties, marketing oil and natural gas production, and developing and executing acquisition, financing and hedging strategies. Our ability to hire and retain our officers and key employees is important to our continued success and growth. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could negatively impact our ability to execute our business strategy.\nBecause we do not operate and therefore control the development of certain of the properties in which we own interests, we may not be able to produce economic quantities of oil and natural gas in a timely manner.\nAt December 31, 2016, approximately 8.3 percent of our proved reserves were attributable to properties for which we were not the operator. As a result, the success and timing of drilling and development activities on properties operated by others depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 the nature and timing of drilling and operational activities;\n\u00b7 the timing and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u00b7 the operators\u2019 expertise and financial resources;\n\u00b7 the approval of other participants in such properties; and\n\u00b7 the selection and application of suitable technology.\nIf drilling and development activities are not conducted on these properties or are not conducted on a timely basis, we may be unable to increase our production or offset normal production declines or we will be required to write-off the reserves attributable thereto, which may adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations. Any such write-offs of our reserves could reduce our ability to borrow money and could reduce the value of our securities.\nUncertainties associated with enhanced recovery methods may result in us not realizing an acceptable return on our investments in such projects.\nWe inject water into formations on some of our properties to increase the production of oil and natural gas. We may in the future expand these efforts to more of our properties or employ other enhanced recovery methods in our operations. The additional production and reserves, if any, attributable to the use of enhanced recovery methods are inherently difficult to predict. If our enhanced recovery methods do not allow for the extraction of oil and natural gas in a manner or to the extent that we anticipate, we may not realize an acceptable return on our investments in such projects.\nPart of our strategy involves using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques, which involve risks and uncertainties in their application.\nOur operations involve utilizing some of the latest drilling and completion techniques. Risks that we face while drilling horizontal wells include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7 landing the wellbore in the desired drilling zone;\n\u00b7 staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation;\n\u00b7 running casing the entire length of the wellbore; and\n\u00b7 being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal wellbore.\nRisks that we face while completing wells include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7 the ability to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages;\n\u00b7 the ability to run tools the entire length of the wellbore during completion operations; and\n\u00b7 the ability to successfully clean out the wellbore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage.\nA terrorist or cyber-attack or armed conflict could harm our business by decreasing our revenues and increasing our costs.\nTerrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts, cyber-attacks and other armed conflict involving the United States may adversely affect the United States and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations. If any of these events occur or escalate, the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas, potentially putting downward pressure on demand for our production and causing a reduction in our revenue. Oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks, and our operations could be adversely impacted if significant infrastructure or facilities used for the production, transportation, processing or marketing of oil and natural gas production are destroyed or damaged. Additionally, as an oil and natural gas producer, we constantly face various cybersecurity threats, including threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable, and there can be no assurance that our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. Costs for insurance, recovery, remediation and other security measures may increase as a result of these threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all.\nCybersecurity breaches and information technology failures could harm our business by increasing our costs and negatively impacting our operations.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems, including Internet sites, computer software, data hosting facilities and other hardware and platforms, some of which are hosted by third parties, to assist in conducting our business. Our information technology systems, as well as those of third parties we use in our operations, may be vulnerable to a variety of evolving cybersecurity risks, such as those involving unauthorized access, malicious software, data privacy breaches by employees or others with authorized access, cyber or phishing-attacks, ransomware and other security issues.\nAlthough we have implemented information technology controls and systems that are designed to protect information and mitigate the risk of data loss and other cybersecurity risks, such measures cannot entirely eliminate cybersecurity threats, and the enhanced controls we have installed may be breached. If our information technology systems cease to function properly or our cybersecurity is breached, we could suffer disruptions to our normal operations which may include drilling,\ncompletion, production and corporate functions. A cyber attack involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business associates, could negatively impact our operations in a variety of ways, including but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7 Unauthorized access to seismic data, reserves information, strategic information, or other sensitive or proprietary information could have a negative impact on our ability to compete for oil and gas resources;\n\u00b7 Data corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruption during drilling activities could result in failure to reach the intended target or a drilling incident;\n\u00b7 Data corruption or operational disruptions of production-related infrastructure could result in a loss of production, or accidental discharge;\n\u00b7 A cyber attack on a vendor or service provider could result in supply chain disruptions which could delay or halt our major development projects;\n\u00b7 A cyber attack on third party gathering, pipeline, or rail transportation systems could delay or prevent us from transporting and marketing our production, resulting in a loss of revenues;\n\u00b7 A cyber attack involving commodities exchanges or financial institutions could slow or halt commodities trading, thus preventing us from marketing our production or engaging in hedging activities, resulting in a loss of revenues;\n\u00b7 A cyber attack which halts activities at a power generation facility or refinery using natural gas as feed stock could have a significant impact on the natural gas market, resulting in reduced demand for our production, lower natural gas prices, and reduced revenues;\n\u00b7 A cyber attack on a communications network or power grid could cause operational disruption resulting in loss of revenues;\n\u00b7 A cyber attack on our automated and surveillance systems could cause a loss in production and potential environmental hazards;\n\u00b7 A deliberate corruption of our financial or operating data could result in events of non-compliance which could then lead to regulatory fines or penalties; and\n\u00b7 A cyber attack resulting in the loss or disclosure of, or damage to, our or any of our customer\u2019s or supplier\u2019s data or confidential information could harm our business by damaging our reputation, subjecting us to potential financial or legal liability, and requiring us to incur significant costs, including costs to repair or restore our systems and data or to take other remedial steps.\nAll of the above could negatively impact our operational and financial results. Additionally, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, some provisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders, including:\n\u00b7 the organization of our board of directors as a classified board, which allows no more than approximately one-third of our directors to be elected each year;\n\u00b7 stockholders cannot remove directors from our board of directors except for cause and then only by the holders of not less than 66 2/3 percent of the voting power of all outstanding voting stock;\n\u00b7 the prohibition of stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u00b7 limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings and establish advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the board of directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders.\nBecause we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock, investors must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in us.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant. Covenants contained in our credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes restrict the payment of dividends. Investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nThe availability of shares for sale in the future could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may issue securities to raise cash for acquisitions. We may also acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash and our common stock or just our common stock. We may also issue securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, our common stock. Any of these events may dilute your ownership interest in our company, reduce our earnings per share and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nIn addition, sales of a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could reduce the market price of our common stock. This could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our securities.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile, which could result in losses for our stockholders.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate and cause price variations to occur. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. If the market price of our common stock declines, you may be unable to sell your shares of common stock at or above your purchase price. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the price of our common stock, or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock, include:\n\u00b7 fluctuations in the price of oil or natural gas;\n\u00b7 variations in our quarterly operating results or failure to meet analysts\u2019 earnings expectations;\n\u00b7 publication of negative research reports about us or the oil and natural gas industry or adverse publicity about the oil and natural gas industry;\n\u00b7 adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future or actions by our stockholders;\n\u00b7 sales of a large number of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur;\n\u00b7 changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u00b7 the effects of government regulation, permitting and other legal requirements, including new legislation or regulation of hydraulic fracturing and the export of oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7 litigation and governmental investigations; and\n\u00b7 general economic and business conditions, either internationally or domestically.", "PERMNO": 92239, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "CXO"}
