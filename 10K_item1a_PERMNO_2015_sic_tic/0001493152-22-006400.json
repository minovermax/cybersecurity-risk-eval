RISK FACTORS\nOur business, including our operating results and financial condition, are subject to a wide variety of risks, including risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial but that could materially and adversely affect our business. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in our filings with the SEC, including our financial statements and related notes. Actual dollar amounts are used in this section.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 pandemic\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCOVID-19 has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response. Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the future adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact the Company\u2019s operational and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company\u2019s control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition or relaxation of protective public safety measures, and the continuing impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for petroleum products. Additional future impacts on the Company may include, but are not limited to, material adverse effects on demand for the Company\u2019s vessels, the Company\u2019s ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company\u2019s financial results.\nWe have experienced, and there are heightened risks that we will continue to experience for the foreseeable future relating to: (i) unpredictable fluctuations in demand; (ii) uncertainties in the oil trading markets, with volatile and unpredictable oil pricing; (iii) heightened risk of off-hire periods resulting from managing virus-related delays; (iv) incurring costs for testing, cleaning, quarantine, immunization and certifications; (v) ability to comply with what are evolving, and sometimes conflicting, logistical health and safety protocols. (vi) difficulty in easily accessing critical supplies such as face masks and other personal protective equipment; (vii) risks related to the reliability and effectiveness of testing methodologies and PPE; (viii) delays in receiving critical supplies, in receiving services of specialized technicians and inspectors, and in concluding vetting of the vessels; (ix) restrictions on travel to or from countries in which OSG operates, or the inability to access certain areas; (x) reduced availability of airlines and other transportation modes to move our crews into position and increased costs associated with such travel; (xi) challenges getting crew to and from the vessels in a manner that both protects their personal safety and endeavors to assure that a joining crew member is not bringing COVID-19 onboard or is otherwise affecting a vessel\u2019s acceptability in service; (xii) increased costs to develop, implement and enforce policies and procedures to deal with all of these challenges; and (xiii) restricted port policies for pilots, tugs and inspections.\nFurther risks relate to potential longer-term impacts of the pandemic on our Jones Act trade. The models we typically use to forecast demand may not be reliable in the wake of this health emergency. The shape and speed of fuel demand recovery could have significant negative impacts on our key customers, refineries in particular, which would likely have a material impact on both domestic tank vessel demand as well as on OSG\u2019s expected forward revenue streams.\nDuring most of 2021 we had seven vessels in layup. As of December 31, 2021, we had four vessels remaining in layup. As of March 1, 2022, two additional vessels have been placed back into service due to increased demand and two vessels remain in layup. While laying up a vessel mitigates our risks and lowers our cost, there are costs involved and no offsetting revenue.\n17 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nThe Company has incurred significant indebtedness, may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness, and could breach covenants in its credit facilities and term loans which could affect our ability to finance operations, pursue desirable business opportunities and successfully run the business in the future, all of which could affect OSG\u2019s ability to fulfill its obligations.\nThe Company\u2019s earnings, cash flow and the market value of its vessels vary significantly due to direct impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, general economic, competitive and market conditions affecting the industry, the cyclical nature of the tanker industry, and legislative and regulatory actions - factors beyond the control of the Company. The amount of debt that OSG can manage in some periods may not be appropriate for other periods and OSG\u2019s ability to meet the financial covenants to which it is subject or may be subject in the future may be at risk. Any insufficiency could negatively impact OSG\u2019s business.\nInsufficiencies in earnings, cash flow and market value of the vessels could require the Company to make mandatory payments or cause the Company to breach certain covenants. If the Company is unable to remedy the relevant breach or obtain a waiver, the Company\u2019s lenders could accelerate its debts and foreclose on the Company\u2019s owned vessels.\nIf OSG does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy its debt obligations, it may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as selling tankers or other assets, reducing or delaying investments and capital expenditures, refinancing or restructuring its debt, and/or seeking to raise additional capital. The Company\u2019s ability to restructure or refinance its debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets, its access to such markets and its financial condition at that time. Any future refinancing of debt could be at higher interest rates and might require the Company to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict OSG\u2019s business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict OSG from adopting certain alternatives. These potential undertakings and alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit OSG to meet its scheduled debt service obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, OSG had $444.7 million of outstanding indebtedness. This substantial indebtedness and interest expense could have important consequences, including (i) limiting OSG\u2019s ability to use cash flow from operations in other areas of its business, such as for working capital, because a substantial portion of these funds are dedicated to service its debt; (ii) requiring the Company to seek to incur additional indebtedness in order to make planned capital expenditures and other expenses or investments; (iii) limiting OSG\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing; (iv) limiting the Company\u2019s flexibility and ability to capitalize on business opportunities or to react to competitive pressures and adverse changes in government regulation, and OSG\u2019s business and industry; (v) increasing OSG\u2019s vulnerability to a downturn and to adverse economic and industry conditions generally; and (vi) limiting the Company\u2019s ability to enter into hedging transactions by reducing the number of counterparties with whom OSG can enter into such transactions as well as the volume of those transactions.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations, to meet its financial covenants, to reduce debt, and/or to obtain alternative financing, could materially and adversely affect OSG\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s significant operating leases will be reduced or could be replaced on less favorable terms, and a portion of the vessels leased are in layup.\nThe Company\u2019s fleet includes ten vessels that have been chartered-in under operating leases. The Company did not exercise options to renew the bareboat charters for three of these ten vessels, which will come into effect in December 2022 and will result in a reduced fleet size. The remaining seven leases expire at various points in the future and may not be replaced at all or on as favorable terms. One of the vessels is currently in layup. The bareboat charter hire continues to be due and paid even if the vessel is in layup, with no corresponding revenue. These circumstances could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s future financial position, profitability, and results of operations and cash flow.\n18 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nChanges in demand in specialized markets in which the Company currently operates or changes in governmental support may lead the Company to redeploy certain vessels to other markets or put its ability to participate in specialized markets at risk.\nThe Company conducts lightering operations in the Delaware Bay with one ATB built for these operations. If there is lower demand for this vessel in the Delaware Bay lightering market, the Company might have to redeploy this ATB in other markets in which it may not be able to compete profitably and/or may require substantial modification. In addition, the Company would be required to pay daily liquidated damages to MARAD if this vessel was deployed in the contiguous coastwise trades.\nThe Company has two vessels participating in the MSP which derive a substantial percentage of revenues earned from transporting cargoes reserved for U.S. Flag vessels under MARAD\u2019s cargo preference program, which is set up to be compliant with certain laws and regulations that require shippers to give U.S.-flag vessels a preference to transport any government-impelled ocean borne cargoes. Among the currently available government-impelled cargoes is a contract the Company has with the Government of Israel (\u201cGOI\u201d) to deliver fuel through December 31, 2022, which the GOI funds with grants from the U.S. government. The Company also seeks other government-impelled cargoes to supplement the GOI business; however, there is no assurance the Company will be able to secure such cargoes. If the OSG is unable to retain the GOI business or is unable to obtain significant other charters for these vessels, the Company may no longer be able to participate in the MSP.\nThe Company operates three Jones Act MR Shuttle Tankers, two of which are currently operating as shuttle tankers serving offshore oil installations in the Gulf of Mexico. Modifications made to enable these tankers to perform the specialized service of a shuttle tanker required the Company to incur substantial capital costs, which in turn allow the Company to earn a premium to market rates earned by conventional Jones Act tankers. The customers with wells and fields in the Gulf of Mexico have high cash production costs and, as such, are vulnerable to production cuts or shut down in response to persistently low oil prices. While shuttle tankers can serve as conventional tankers without further modification, future reduction in the demand for specialized shuttle tanker services could limit the Company\u2019s ability to earn such premiums.\nIf OSG is no longer able to participate in any of these niche businesses, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nChanges in demand have affected Time Charter commitments. OSG may not be able to renew Time Charters when they expire or enter into new Time Charters and vessels may be placed in layup.\nAs a direct result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on OSG\u2019s business, our customers have been reluctant to commit to long-term Time Charters while the markets remain uncertain. OSG\u2019s ability to obtain new charters or renew expiring contracts will depend on the prevailing market conditions. Renewals or new contracts may be at less favorable rates or for shorter duration. There may be a gap in employment between charters or the vessel may only be able to be employed on the spot market, both of which would affect utilization rates and result in increased costs to the Company. When there is no demand for a vessel, there is also a risk of the necessity to layup the vessel, as demonstrated during the course of 2021. These occurrences would adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nInability to attract or retain qualified mariners may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected the market for qualified mariners. Competition from other shipping sectors, such as container shipping, has led to increasing demand for certain mariners and higher wages being offered potentially detracting certain mariners from OSG\u2019s business. During 2021 while some of OSG\u2019s fleet was laid-up, many of our mariners were laid off and may have found alternative employment elsewhere. Our vessels must be manned by qualified mariners that meet the standards of experience set by our customers. If we are unable to attract or retain qualified mariners, we may not be able to provide the services contracted for, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe Company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from a limited number of customers and is subject to credit risks, and the loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these customers could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s largest customers account for a significant portion of its revenues. The Company\u2019s top two customers comprised approximately 38.8% of the Company\u2019s revenues during 2021. Changes in the broader market, such as closures of U.S. refining facilities, have occurred that reduce the locations to and from which oil is delivered or refined oil is sourced.\nThe Company has entered into, and in the future will enter into, various contracts associated with the operation of its vessels. The ability of each of the Company\u2019s customers, lenders, suppliers, and other counterparties to perform their obligations will depend on a number of factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control and may include general economic conditions; availability of debt or equity financing; the condition of the maritime and offshore industries; the financial condition of the counterparty; charter rates received for specific types of vessels; and volatile expenses in obtaining supplies. Charterers are sensitive to the commodity markets and may be impacted by market forces affecting commodities such as oil. In addition, as we are currently experiencing, in depressed market conditions, the Company\u2019s charterers and customers may no longer need a vessel that had been under charter or contract or may be able to obtain a comparable vessel at lower rates, or adverse financial conditions may inhibit these entities from entering into new commitments with OSG. As a result, the Company\u2019s customers may fail to pay charter hire or attempt to renegotiate charter rates. If the counterparties fail to meet their obligations, the Company could suffer losses on such contracts which would decrease revenues, cash flows and earnings.\nThese factors could have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s revenues, profitability and cash flows, as well as its borrowing ability and financial condition. The loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these customers and refinery locations could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n19 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nOperating costs and capital expenses will increase as the Company\u2019s vessels age and due to unexpected drydocks.\nIn general, capital expenditures, cargo insurance rates and other costs necessary for maintaining a vessel in good operating condition increase as the age of the vessel increases. Changes in governmental regulations and compliance with Classification Society standards may restrict the type of activities in which the vessels may engage and/or may require OSG to make additional expenditures for new equipment. Vessels must be drydocked periodically for inspection and maintenance, and in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage. The cost of repairs and renewals required at each drydock are difficult to predict with certainty but can be substantial, and the Company\u2019s insurance may not cover these costs. Vessels in drydock will generally not generate any income. In addition, the time when a vessel is out of service for maintenance is determined by a number of factors including regulatory deadlines, market conditions, shipyard availability and customer requirements.\nAs a result of these factors, OSG may be required to incur substantial costs or take its vessels out of service. Market conditions may not justify such expenditures or permit OSG to operate its vessels profitably even if those vessels remain operational. These cost increases, delays, expenses and off-hire time could have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nInterruption, failure or breach of OSG\u2019s information technology and communications systems could impair its ability to operate and adversely affect its business.\nOSG has both on-shore and ship-board systems that are highly dependent on information technology systems. The Company collects, stores and transmits data using both internal information technology systems and those of third-party vendors. The secure storage, processing, maintenance, and transmission of sensitive data, including our own proprietary business information and that of our customers, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, is critical to the Company\u2019s operations.\nInformation technology and communication systems are subject to reliability issues, integration and compatibility concerns, and security-threatening intrusions. OSG may experience failures caused by the occurrence of natural disasters, computer hacking or viruses or other unanticipated problems at OSG\u2019s facilities, aboard its vessels or at third-party locations. OSG\u2019s network, or those of our clients or third-party vendors, could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, or targeted attacks intended to steal or destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage.\nThe Company may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against these threats or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. Security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities and could also cause customers to lose confidence in our systems.\nOSG has not experienced any material cyber security violation or occurrence over the last three years, and we invest time, effort and financial resources to secure our systems, networks and communications. However, these activities cannot provide absolute assurance that we will be successful in preventing or responding to all cyber security attacks. Any failure of OSG\u2019s or third-party systems could result in interruptions in service, reductions in its revenue and profits, damage to our reputation and brand, or liability for the release of confidential information, and there can be no assurance that any breach or incident will not have a material impact on our operations and financial results.\n20 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nDelays or disruptions in implementing new technological and management systems could impair the Company\u2019s ability to operate and adversely affect its business.\nThe Company is currently in the process of transitioning to a new software system for managing ship operations. From time to time the Company implements new systems or upgrades technological resources utilized in running its business. The transition to new technology requires a significant investment in capital and personnel resources and the coordination of numerous software and system providers and internal business teams. The Company may experience difficulties as it manages these changes and transitions to a new system and upgrades its technological resources, including loss or corruption of data, delays, decreases in productivity as personnel implement and become familiar with new systems and processes, and unanticipated expenses. Additionally, the Company could be adversely affected if the new software system it is implementing for managing ship operations or other new or upgraded technological resource are defective, not installed properly, fail to perform as marketed or are not properly integrated into existing operations. In addition, the implementation of a new system may not result in improvements that outweigh the cost of implementation. System implementation failures or operational failures, including unauthorized access by third parties to our new software system (which could have the effects described in the preceding risk factor) could have adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, and ability to operate in a complex industry.\nWe could face significant liability if one or more multiemployer plans in which we participate is reported to have underfunded liabilities and we withdraw from participation in one or more multiemployer pension plans in which we participate.\nThe Company is a party to collective-bargaining agreements that require contributions to three jointly managed multiemployer pension plans covering seagoing personnel of U.S. Flag vessels. Our required contributions to these plans could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these plans, the inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, low interest rates, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. Certain of these multiemployer plans are currently underfunded. Significantly underfunded pension plans are required to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their under-funding. As a result, OSG\u2019s required contributions to these plans may increase in the future. In addition, a termination of or voluntary withdrawal from or a mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan would require OSG to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of such multiemployer pension plan\u2019s unfunded vested liabilities. See Note 15, \u201cPension and Other Post Retirement Benefit Plans,\u201d to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 for additional information. Requirements to pay increased contributions or withdrawal liabilities could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nVolatile changes in supply and demand for oil and refined products, charter rates and vessel values, and the factors that influence such changes, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings, liquidity and available cash.\nThe marine transportation industry is both cyclical and volatile in terms of demand, charter rates and profitability. Fluctuations in charter rates and vessel values result from changes in supply and demand both for tanker capacity and for oil and oil products. Factors affecting these changes in supply and demand are generally outside of the Company\u2019s control. Aside from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, additional factors influencing the demand for tanker capacity, and impacting our costs and profitability, include: (i) supply and demand for, and availability of energy resources such as oil, oil products and natural gas, which affect customers\u2019 need for vessel capacity; (ii) availability of refining capacity and inventories; (iii) changes in the production levels of crude oil; (iv) increases in the supply of Jones Act vessels without a commensurate increase in demand; (v) global and regional economic and political conditions, including armed conflicts, terrorist activities and strikes, and international sanctions, embargoes, import and export restrictions or nationalizations and wars, such as the situation currently occurring with Ukraine and Russia, that create uncertainties in the supply of and demand for oil; (vi) changes in seaborne and other transportation patterns, including changes in the distances that cargoes are transported, changes in the price of crude oil and changes to the West Texas Intermediate and Brent Crude Oil pricing benchmarks; and (vii) increasing interest globally, from a regulatory and demand viewpoint, in transitioning to carbon neutral energy sources and the development and use of alternative fuels in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that impact the fuel we transport as cargo and use in fueling our own vessels (see further the risk factor, below, relating to compliance with regulations).\n21 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nMany of the factors that influence the demand for tanker capacity will also, in the longer term, effectively influence the supply of tanker capacity, since decisions to build new capacity, invest in capital repairs, invest in new technologies or equipment, or to retain in service older capacity are influenced by the general state of the marine transportation industry from time to time. Factors influencing the supply of vessel capacity include (i) the number of newbuild deliveries or the conversion of vessels into or out of transporting oil; (ii) the number of vessels removed from service, such as via recycling, scrapping or conversion to storage; and (iii) the availability and pricing of other energy sources such as natural gas for which tankers can be used or to which construction capacity may be dedicated.\nThe nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions are unpredictable and could adversely affect the values of the Company\u2019s vessels or result in significant fluctuations in the amount of charter revenues the Company earns, which could result in significant volatility in OSG\u2019s quarterly results and cash flows.\nThe market value of vessels fluctuates significantly, which could adversely affect OSG\u2019s liquidity or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition.\nWhile Jones Act and U.S. Flag vessel market values have, on average, generally declined over the past several years, the market value of Jones Act vessels has fluctuated over time. The fluctuating market values of the vessels can impact the Company\u2019s liquidity regardless of whether the Company sells or continues to hold the vessels. For example, selling a vessel at a sale price that is less than the vessel\u2019s carrying amount on the Company\u2019s financial statements will result in a loss on the sale and a reduction in earnings and surplus. Declining values of the Company\u2019s vessels could adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity by limiting its ability to raise cash by refinancing vessels. The Company may also experience significant impairment charges upon a decline in vessel value. Any charges relating to such impairments could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in fuel prices may adversely affect profits.\nFuel is a significant expense in the Company\u2019s shipping operations when vessels are under voyage charter. Accordingly, an increase in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability if these increases cannot be passed onto customers. Moreover, higher fuel prices could reduce the profitability and competitiveness of the Company\u2019s business compared to other forms of transportation. The price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside the Company\u2019s control.\nOSG conducts certain of its operations internationally, which subjects the Company to changing economic, political and governmental conditions abroad that may adversely affect its business.\nThe Company conducts certain of its operations internationally, and its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected by changing economic, political and government conditions in the countries and regions where its vessels are employed. OSG must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as environmental regulations requiring investments and upgrades, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, anti-money laundering laws; and anti-competition regulations. OSG\u2019s operations may also subject its employees and agents to extortion attempts. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on the Company\u2019s business operations and on the Company\u2019s ability to transport cargo to one or more countries, and could also materially affect the Company\u2019s brand, ability to attract and retain employees, international operations, business and operating results. Although OSG has policies and procedures designed to achieve compliance with these laws and regulations, OSG cannot be certain that its employees, contractors, joint venture partners or agents will not violate these policies and procedures.\nShipping is a business with inherent risks, and OSG\u2019s insurance may not be adequate to cover its losses.\nOSG\u2019s vessels and their cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost due to accidents, bad weather, mechanical failure, human error, and other factors. These hazards may result in death or injury; loss of revenues or property; environmental damage; higher insurance rates; damage to customer relationships and industry reputation; and market disruptions, and delay or rerouting, all of which may also subject OSG to litigation. The operation of tankers has unique operational risks associated with the transportation of oil. An oil spill may cause significant environmental damage and the associated costs could exceed the insurance coverage available to the Company. While the Company carries insurance to protect against certain of these risks, risks may arise against which the Company is not adequately insured. In the past, new and stricter environmental regulations have led to higher costs for insurance covering environmental damage or pollution, and new regulations could lead to similar increases or even make this type of insurance unavailable.\n22 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nTerrorism, piracy, or hostilities could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nAlthough the Company\u2019s fleet operates mainly in U.S. waters, there are occasions when a vessel may be in an area where terrorist or pirate attacks, or hijacking are a concern. If attacks result in regions in which the Company\u2019s vessels are deployed being characterized by insurers as \u201cwar risk\u201d zones or Joint War Committee \u201cwar and strikes\u201d listed areas, premiums payable for insurance coverage could increase significantly, and such insurance coverage may become difficult to obtain. Crew costs could also increase in such circumstances due to risks of piracy attacks. While OSG believes the charterer remains liable for charter payments when a vessel is seized by pirates, disputes with the charterer may result in the delay or non-payment of charter hire, or cancellation of the charter party. The Company may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents, or an increase in the cost (or unavailability) of insurance for those vessels could have a material adverse impact on OSG\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such attacks may also impact the Company\u2019s customers, which could impair their ability to make payments to the Company under its charters.\nTerrorism or international hostilities could cause political instability, damage the world economy, adversely affect the availability of and demand for crude oil and petroleum products and adversely affect both the Company\u2019s ability to charter its vessels and the charter rates payable under any such charters. These factors could also increase the costs to the Company of conducting its business, particularly crew, insurance and security costs, and prevent or restrict the Company from obtaining insurance coverage, all of which could have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nThe Company\u2019s business would be adversely affected if it failed to comply with the Jones Act\u2019s limitations on U.S. coastwise trade, or if these limitations were waived, modified or repealed, or if changes in international trade agreements were to occur.\nThe Company is responsible for monitoring the foreign ownership of its common stock and other interests to ensure compliance with the Jones Act. The Company could lose the privilege of owning and operating vessels in the Jones Act trade if non-U.S. Citizens were to own or control, in the aggregate, more than 25% of the equity interests in the Company. Such loss would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. In addition, failure to comply with the Jones Act could result in the Company being deemed to have violated other U.S. federal laws that prohibit a foreign transfer of U.S. documented vessels without government approval, resulting in severe penalties, including permanent loss of U.S. coastwise trading privileges or forfeiture of the vessels deemed transferred, and fines.\nMaritime transportation services are currently excluded from the General Agreement on Trade in Services (\u201cGATS\u201d) and are the subject of reservations by the United States in the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d) and other international free trade agreements. If maritime transportation services were included in GATS, NAFTA or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise repealed or altered, the transportation of maritime cargo between U.S. ports could be opened to international flag or foreign built vessels. Interest groups regularly lobby Congress, and legislation has been introduced, to repeal certain provisions of the Jones Act or to grant extensive waivers so as to facilitate international flag competition for trades and cargoes currently reserved for U.S. Flag vessels under the Jones Act. The Company expects that continued efforts will be made to modify, repeal, or waive the Jones Act. Because international vessels may have lower construction costs, wage rates and operating costs, this could significantly increase competition in the coastwise trade, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe U.S. government could requisition the Company\u2019s vessels during a period of war or emergency, which may negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and available cash.\nThe U.S. government could requisition one or more of the Company\u2019s vessels for title or hire, typically occurring during a period of war or emergency. OSG participates in the Maritime Security Program for such purposes. The U.S. government requisition of one or more of the Company\u2019s vessels could impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and available cash if the charter rates we receive from the government while on requisition are less than the charter rates that are being replaced, or if the government refuses to pay the requisition charter rate, in which case we would seek recovery through our insurance policies.\n23 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nCompliance with complex laws and regulations, including those seeking to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus, and environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the emission of greenhouse gas gases and ballast water treatment, may adversely affect OSG\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are affected by extensive and changing international, national and local environmental protection laws, regulations, treaties, conventions and standards designed to reduce the risk of oil spills and water pollution and to regulate air emissions, including emission of greenhouse gases. These requirements impose significant capital and operating costs on OSG. In the United States, the Company is subject to the oversight of government agencies including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation. OPA 90 affects all vessel owners shipping oil or hazardous material to, from or within the United States. OPA 90 allows for potentially unlimited liability without regard to fault for owners, operators and bareboat charterers of vessels for oil pollution in U.S. waters. Similarly, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, as amended, which has been adopted by most countries outside of the United States, imposes liability for oil pollution in international waters. Other significant international conventions to which the United States is signatory are the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (\u201cMARPOL\u201d), the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (\u201cSOLAS\u201d), and the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (\u201cSTCW\u201d). Additionally, OPA 90 expressly permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to hazardous materials and oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries. Coastal states in the United States have enacted pollution prevention liability and response laws, many providing for unlimited liability.\nDue to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries, including the United States, and international organizations, including the IMO and the European Union, have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Regulations and the reporting mechanisms to measure emissions are evolving as they attempt to standardize the reporting of varying operational factors for many types of vessels and conditions, including such measures as the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (\u201cEEXI\u201d) and the Carbon Intensity Indicator (\u201cCII\u201d). The adoption of such actions could result in significant financial and operational impacts on the Company\u2019s business and on the global industry, including requiring OSG to install new emission controls, to invest in technologies or equipment to retrofit on our vessels, to acquire allowances or to pay taxes related to its greenhouse gas emissions. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Environmental, Safety and Security Matters.\u201d.\nIn order to comply with laws and regulations, the Company incurs substantial capital and/or operating expenditures and develops contingency arrangements for potential spills or to reduce and control emissions. The Company is in the process of installing ballast water treatment systems on its vessels at substantial capital cost. Although the Company has performed due diligence in choosing the particular systems, there is no assurance that the technologies chosen will perform as expected or be installed without delays.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations can affect the resale value or significantly reduce the useful lives of the Company\u2019s vessels, require a reduction in carrying capacity, ship modifications or operational changes or restrictions (and related increased operating costs) or retirement of service, lead to decreased availability or higher cost of insurance coverage for environmental matters or result in the denial of access to, or detention in, certain jurisdictional waters or ports. Under local, national and foreign laws, as well as international treaties and conventions, OSG could incur material liabilities, including cleanup obligations, natural resource damages, fines and penalties in the event that there is a release of oil, petroleum or other hazardous substances from its vessels or otherwise in connection with its operations. OSG could be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to the release of or exposure to hazardous materials associated with its current or historic operations. Violations of or liabilities under environmental requirements also can result in substantial penalties, fines and other sanctions, including in certain instances, seizure or detention of the Company\u2019s vessels.\nIt can be expected that these regulations will continue to become stricter in the future and will require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures to keep its vessels in compliance, or even to scrap or sell certain vessels altogether. Such expenditures could result in financial and operational impacts that may be material to OSG\u2019s financial statements. The failure to comply with local, domestic and foreign regulations may subject the Company to increased liability, may invalidate existing insurance or decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports.\nThe employment of the Company\u2019s vessels could be adversely affected by an inability to clear the oil majors\u2019 risk assessment process.\nThe major oil companies have developed a strict due diligence process for selecting their shipping partners out of concerns for the environmental impact of spills. This vetting process has evolved into a sophisticated and comprehensive risk assessment of both the vessel manager and the vessel. The Company\u2019s charterers require that the Company\u2019s vessels and the technical managers pass vetting inspections and management audits. The Company\u2019s failure to maintain any of its vessels to these standards could put the Company in breach of the applicable charter agreement and lead to termination of such agreement thereby adversely affecting the revenues of the Company.\n24 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.\nTransfers or issuances of the Company\u2019s equity may impair or reduce the Company\u2019s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes in the future.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. An \u201cownership change\u201d is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50% of a corporation\u2019s stock over a rolling three-year period by stockholders that own (directly or indirectly) 5% or more of the stock of a corporation or arising from a new issuance of stock by a corporation. If an ownership change occurs, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the use of pre-ownership change NOLs, credits and certain other tax attributes to offset taxable income earned after the ownership change. The annual limitation is equal to the product of the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate and the value of the company\u2019s stock immediately before the ownership change. This annual limitation may be adjusted to reflect any unused annual limitation for prior years and certain recognized built-in gains and losses for the year. In addition, Section 383 generally limits the amount of tax liability in any post-ownership change year that can be reduced by pre-ownership change tax credit carryforwards. If the Company were to undergo an \u201cownership change,\u201d it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 51457, "SIC": 4412, "TIC": "OSG"}
