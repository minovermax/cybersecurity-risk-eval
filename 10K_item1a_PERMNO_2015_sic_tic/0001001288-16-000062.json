{"cik": "1001288", "company": "LEXMARK INTERNATIONAL INC /KY/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following significant factors, as well as others of which Lexmark is unaware or deems to be immaterial at this time, could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or operating results in the future. Therefore, the following information should be considered carefully together with other information contained in this report. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nThe Company recently announced that it is exploring strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value. There can be no assurance that a transaction will occur, or if a transaction does occur, that the Company will successfully enhance shareholder value. In addition, the process of exploring strategic alternatives could negatively impact the Company\u2019s operating results.\nOn October 23, 2015, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had initiated a process to explore strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value and unlock the intrinsic value created by the Company. However, there can be no assurance that a transaction will occur, or if a transaction does occur, there can be no assurances as to the potential value created by the transaction to the Company and its shareholders.\nThe process of exploring strategic alternatives could negatively impact the Company\u2019s operating results, as the decision could impact customer decision-making, including the delay or loss of orders. In addition, the announcement may cause uncertainty and negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees and its failure to do so could harm the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations, global economic weakness and uncertainty and reductions in government spending could adversely impact the Company\u2019s revenue and other financial results.\nMore than 50% of the Company\u2019s revenue is generated from operations outside of the United States. In 2015, the Company\u2019s total revenue was adversely impacted 6% year to year by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations even with a foreign currency exchange hedging program in place for 2015. The Company\u2019s financial results, which are expressed in U.S. dollars, may continue to be adversely impacted by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, particularly the Euro, the Canadian dollar, the Brazilian real, the Australian dollar and the British pound. The Company enters into foreign currency option contracts as a hedge of a portion of some of the anticipated foreign currency denominated revenue. While these hedges\nare designed to partially mitigate some of the Company\u2019s exposure to foreign currency gains and losses, additional changes in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely impact economic activity and the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s revenue is largely dependent on global economic conditions and the demand for its imaging products and associated supplies, solutions and services and capture, content, and process and output management software solutions and services in the markets in which the Company competes. Continued global economic weakness and uncertainty, similar to what the Company experienced in Brazil in 2015, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results in future periods. During times of economic uncertainty, demand for the Company\u2019s products may decrease and may result in decreased revenue, operating income and other financial results.\nContinued softness in certain markets and industries, constrained IT spending, and uncertainty about global economic conditions could result in lower demand for the Company\u2019s products, including supplies. Weakness in demand has resulted in intense price competition and may result in excessive inventory for the Company and/or its reseller channel, as the Company experienced in Europe in 2015, which may adversely affect sales, pricing, risk of obsolescence and/or other elements of the Company\u2019s operating results. Ongoing weakness in demand for the Company\u2019s hardware products may also cause erosion of the installed base of products over time, thereby reducing the opportunities for supplies sales in the future.\nRestrictions on credit globally and credit risk associated with the Company\u2019s customers and channel partners may also be adversely impacted by continued global economic weakness and uncertainty.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s revenue is derived from contracts with the U.S federal, state and local governments and their agencies, as well as international governments and their agencies. Any reductions in U.S. or foreign government spending could significantly reduce demand for the Company\u2019s hardware products, services and solutions and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s revenue, operating income and financial condition.\nDecreased consumption of supplies could negatively impact the Company\u2019s operating results.\nApproximately 60% of the Company\u2019s revenue in 2015 was derived from the sale of supplies. In the second half of 2015, the Company announced efforts to reduce laser supplies inventory in its partner sales channel which were elevated in part because of decreased consumption of supplies. These efforts adversely impacted laser supplies revenue for 2015. The Company\u2019s future operating results may be adversely affected if the consumption of its supplies by end users of its products is lower than expected or declines, if there are declines in pricing, unfavorable mix and/or increased costs.\nChanges of printing behavior driven by adoption of electronic processes and/or use of mobile devices such as tablets and smart phones by businesses could result in a reduction in printing, which could adversely impact consumption of supplies.\nIf the Company cannot successfully execute on its strategy to become an end-to-end solutions provider, the Company\u2019s revenue and gross margin may suffer.\nSince the Company\u2019s acquisition of Perceptive Software in June 2010, the Company\u2019s strategy has been based on becoming an end-to-end solutions provider of content, capture, and process and output management solutions, enabling businesses to capture, manage and access critical unstructured information in the context of their business process. In executing that strategy, the Company has made significant investments in complementary software companies, including ReadSoft in 2014 and Kofax Limited in 2015, to enhance the Company\u2019s solutions capabilities. The Company needs to continue integrating these new technologies into its solutions offerings and continue to focus the Company on delivering integrated imaging and content, process and output management solutions to businesses. Failure to execute this strategy could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenue and gross margin.\nThe Company may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of any investments, acquisitions or other significant transactions, which could harm financial results.\nAs part of Lexmark\u2019s strategy of becoming an end-to-end solutions provider, the Company routinely discusses, evaluates opportunities, and may enter into agreements regarding possible investments, acquisitions, and other transactions. Such transactions, including the acquisitions of Perceptive Software in 2010; Pallas Athena in 2011; Brainware, Nolij, ISYS and Acuo Technologies in 2012; AccessVia, Twistage, Saperion and Pacsgear in 2013; ReadSoft and GNAX Health in 2014, and Claron Technology and Kofax in 2015 routinely involve significant risks and challenges and the Company may not be able to realize all of the anticipated benefits of such transactions. The transaction may fail to advance the Company\u2019s business strategy of becoming an end-to-end solutions provider. The Company may not realize a satisfactory return on investment. The Company\u2019s due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with an acquired company\u2019s products, financial disclosures, accounting practices or internal control deficiencies. The future business operations of an acquired entity may not be successful. The Company may not be able to realize expense synergies and revenue expansion goals. Disruptions from the transaction could harm relationships with the Company\u2019s or the acquired entity\u2019s existing customers, business partners,\nemployees and suppliers. The Company\u2019s acquisition or other investment may lead to litigation. Intangible assets and goodwill recognized by the Company in the acquisition could become impaired if subsequent measurements of fair value and implied value, respectively, do not support the carrying values of such assets.\nThe Company\u2019s acquisitions present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the newly acquired business into the Company, and there can be no assurances that the Company will manage the integration of the newly acquired business successfully. The Company is in the process of integrating ReadSoft and Kofax and each of the Company\u2019s acquisitions pose integration challenges, including the retention of customers and key employees, capitalizing on revenue synergies, and the difficulty of integrating business systems and technology. The Company\u2019s management may be required to spend a significant amount of time and resources to integrate these newly acquired businesses and the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may take longer to achieve, if at all. The Company may not be able to successfully combine product and service offerings of acquired companies. The Company may have a difficult time retaining key employees of acquired entities if its business culture is incompatible with that of the acquired entity. If the Company fails to integrate ReadSoft and Kofax on a timely basis, the Company may not meet its expectations regarding the profitability of such acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nAny failure by the Company to execute planned cost reduction measures timely and successfully could result in total costs and expenses that are greater than expected or the failure to meet operational goals as a result of such actions.\nIn July 2015, the Company announced restructuring actions primarily to capture the anticipated cost and expense synergies from the Kofax and ReadSoft acquisitions, and to reduce cost and expense structure in the ISS segment and corporate organization. The Company announced additional restructuring actions in February 2016 focused on optimizing the ISS segment. The Company expects to realize cost savings now and in the future through these cost and expense actions and may announce future actions to further reduce its worldwide workforce and/or centralize its operations. The risks associated with these actions include potential delays in their implementation, particularly workforce reductions; increased costs associated with such actions; decreases in employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to unplanned departures of employees, particularly key employees and sales employees.\nThe competitive pricing pressure in the market may negatively impact the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company and its major competitors, many of which have significantly greater financial, marketing and/or technological resources than the Company, have regularly lowered prices on their products and are expected to continue to do so. In 2015, the laser printer market experienced and is expected to continue to experience significant price pressure, resulting in a decline in laser hardware revenue. Price reductions on laser products, including related supplies or the inability to reduce costs and expenses, could result in lower profitability and jeopardize the Company\u2019s ability to grow or maintain its market share. In recent years, the gross margins on the Company\u2019s hardware products have been under pressure as a result of competitive pricing pressures in the market. If the Company is unable to reduce costs to offset this competitive pricing or product mix pressure, and the Company is unable to support declining gross margins through the sale of supplies, the Company\u2019s operating results and future profitability may be negatively impacted.\nThe market for Enterprise Software\u2019s products and services is highly competitive, and the Company expects competition will continue to intensify as the enterprise content, business content and document output markets mature. Enterprise Software competes with a number of ECM, BPM and DOM/CCM providers that have significantly greater financial, marketing and/or technological resources than the Company. Enterprise Software could lose market share if its competitors introduce new products and services, add functionality to existing products, or reduce prices on their products and services. If such competitors lower prices with respect to competing products and services, the Company could be forced to lower prices for Enterprise Software\u2019s products and services, which could result in less revenue or reduced gross margins, which may negatively impact the Company\u2019s operating results and future profitability.\nIf the Company\u2019s data protection or other security measures are compromised and, as a result, the Company\u2019s data, the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 data or the Company\u2019s IT systems are accessed improperly, made unavailable, or improperly modified, the Company\u2019s products and services may be perceived as vulnerable, its brand and reputation could be damaged, the IT services the Company provides could be disrupted, and customers may stop using the Company\u2019s products and services, all of which could reduce the Company\u2019s revenue and earnings and expose the Company to legal claims and regulatory actions.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services store, retrieve, manipulate and manage the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 information and data as well as the Company\u2019s own. The Company has invested a great deal of time and resources in protecting the integrity and security of the Company\u2019s products, services and internal and external data being managed. Nevertheless, computer hackers could attempt to penetrate or bypass the Company\u2019s data protection and other security measures and gain unauthorized access to its networks, systems and data or compromise the confidential information or data of the Company\u2019s customers. Computer hackers may be able to develop and deploy IT related viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that could attack the Company\u2019s products and services, exploit potential security vulnerabilities of the Company\u2019s\nproducts and services, create system disruptions and cause shutdowns or denials of service. Data may also be accessed or modified improperly as a result of employee or supplier error or malfeasance and third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to the Company\u2019s data and/or the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 data.\nThese risks for the Company will increase as the Company continues to grow the Company\u2019s cloud-based offerings and services and store and process increasingly large amounts of the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 confidential information and data and host or manage parts of the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 businesses in cloud-based IT environments, especially in customer sectors involving particularly sensitive data such as medical information, financial services and the government.\nIf a cyberattack or other security incident described above were to allow unauthorized access to or modification of the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 data, the Company\u2019s own data or the Company\u2019s IT systems, or if the services provided to the Company\u2019s customers were disrupted, or if its products or services are perceived as having security vulnerabilities, the Company could suffer damage to its brand and reputation. This could result in reduced revenue and earnings. The costs the Company would incur to address and fix these security incidents would increase its expenses. These types of security incidents could also lead to lawsuits, regulatory investigations and claims and increased legal liability, including in some cases contractual costs related to customer notification and fraud monitoring.\nFurther, as regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and worldwide laws and regulations concerning the protection of personal information expand and become more complex, these potential risks to the Company\u2019s business will intensify. Changes in laws or regulations associated with the protection of certain types of data, such as healthcare data or other personally identifiable information, could greatly increase the Company\u2019s cost of providing its products and services.\nChanges in the Company\u2019s tax provisions or tax related assets or liabilities could negatively impact the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where the Company has lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where the Company has higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities, gains on the management of the Company\u2019s foreign exchange risks, or changes in tax laws, regulations, and accounting principles. The Company is subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, the determination of the Company\u2019s worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax related assets or liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although the Company, and its legal and financial advisors, believe the Company\u2019s estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in the Company\u2019s financial statements and may materially affect the Company\u2019s financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. A material assessment by a taxing authority or a decision to repatriate foreign cash could adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to perform satisfactorily under service contracts for managed print services or software services may negatively impact the Company\u2019s strategy and operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to perform satisfactorily under service contracts for managed print services and other customer services may result in the loss of customers, loss of reputation and/or financial consequences that may have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial results and strategy.\nThe inability to attract, retain and motivate key employees could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nIn order to compete, the Company must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other key employees, and its failure to do so could harm the Company\u2019s results of operations. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, engineers, technical staff, sales, marketing and IT support positions are critical to the Company\u2019s business, and competition for experienced employees in Lexmark\u2019s industry can be intense. To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, the Company must offer a competitive compensation package, including cash, cash-based incentive awards and share-based incentive awards, such as restricted stock units. Because the cash-based and share-based incentive awards are dependent upon the performance conditions relating to the Company\u2019s performance and the performance of the price of the Company\u2019s common stock, the future value of such awards are uncertain. If the anticipated value of such incentive awards does not materialize, or if the total compensation package ceases to be viewed as competitive, the Company\u2019s ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees could be weakened, which could harm the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nIneffective internal controls could impact the Company's business and financial results.\nThe Company's internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If the Company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the Company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the Company's business and financial results could be harmed and the Company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. For example, in connection with management\u2019s evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, management determined that the Company did not maintain effective controls over the completeness, existence, accuracy and presentation and disclosure of the accounting for income taxes, including the income tax provision and related tax assets and liabilities. Management determined that the ineffective controls over income tax accounting constitutes a material weakness. While the Company is in the process of improving its internal controls, the material weakness continued to exist as of December 31, 2015 and will continue to exist until the remediation actions described in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, are fully implemented and tested. If the new controls being implemented to address the material weakness and to strengthen the overall internal control over accounting for income taxes are not designed or do not operate effectively, if the Company is unsuccessful in implementing or following these new processes or is otherwise unable to remediate this material weakness, this may result in untimely or inaccurate reporting of the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to manage inventory levels or production capacity may negatively impact the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s performance depends in part upon its ability to successfully forecast the timing and extent of customer demand and reseller demand to manage worldwide distribution and inventory levels of the Company. Unexpected fluctuations in customer demand or in reseller inventory levels could disrupt ordering patterns and may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results, inventory levels and cash flows. In addition, the financial failure or loss of a key customer, reseller or supplier could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial results. The Company must also be able to address production and supply constraints, including product disruptions caused by quality issues, and delays or disruptions in the supply of key components necessary for production. Such delays, disruptions or shortages may result in lost revenue or in the Company incurring additional costs to meet customer demand. The Company\u2019s future operating results and its ability to effectively grow or maintain its market share may be adversely affected if it is unable to address these issues on a timely basis.\nThe revenue and profitability of the Company\u2019s operations have historically varied, which makes future financial results less predictable.\nThe Company\u2019s revenue, gross margin and profit vary among hardware, software, supplies and services, product groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely be different in future periods than current results. Overall gross margins and profitability in any given period is dependent upon the hardware/software/supplies mix, the mix of hardware products sold, and the geographic mix reflected in that period\u2019s revenue. Overall market trends, seasonal market trends, competitive pressures, pricing, commoditization of products, increased component or shipping costs and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins in a given period.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to develop new products and enhance existing products to meet customer product requirements on a cost competitive basis may negatively impact the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s future operating results may be adversely affected if it is unable to continue to develop, manufacture and market products that are reliable, competitive, and meet customers\u2019 needs. The markets for laser products and associated supplies and content/process management software are aggressively competitive, especially with respect to pricing and the introduction of new technologies and products offering improved features and functionality. In addition, the introduction of any significant new and/or disruptive technology or business model by a competitor that substantially changes the markets into which the Company sells its products or demand for the products sold by the Company could severely impact sales of the Company\u2019s products and the Company\u2019s operating results. The impact of competitive activities on the sales volumes or revenue of the Company, or the Company\u2019s inability to effectively deal with these competitive issues, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers and maintain or grow market share. The competitive pressure to develop technology and products and to increase the Company\u2019s investment in research and development and marketing expenditures also could cause significant changes in the level of the Company\u2019s operating expense.\nThe Company may experience difficulties in product transitions negatively impacting the Company\u2019s performance and operating results.\nThe introduction of products by the Company or its competitors, or delays in customer purchases of existing products in anticipation of new product introductions by the Company or its competitors and market acceptance of new products and pricing programs, any disruption in the supply of new or existing products as well as the costs of any product recall or increased warranty, repair or replacement costs due to quality issues, the reaction of competitors to any such new products or programs, the life cycles of the Company\u2019s products, as well as delays in product development and manufacturing, and variations in cost, including but not limited to component parts, raw materials, commodities, energy, products, labor rates, distributors, fuel and variations in supplier terms and conditions, may impact sales, may cause a buildup in the Company\u2019s inventories, make the transition from current products to new products difficult and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s future operating results.\nDue to the international nature of the Company\u2019s business, changes in a country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions or other factors could negatively impact the Company\u2019s revenue, financial condition or operating results.\nRevenue derived from international sales made up more than half of the Company\u2019s revenue in 2015. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s future results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including changes in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; trade protection measures; local labor regulations; import, export or other licensing requirements; requirements related to making foreign direct investments; and unexpected changes in legal or regulatory requirements. In addition, changes in tax laws and the ability to repatriate cash accumulated outside the U.S. in a tax efficient manner may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results, investment flexibility and operations. Moreover, margins on international sales tend to be lower than those on domestic sales, and the Company believes that international operations in emerging geographic markets will be less profitable than operations in the U.S. and European markets, in part, because of the higher investment levels for marketing, selling and distribution required to enter these markets.\nIn many foreign countries, particularly those with developing economies, it is common for local business practices to be prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to the Company, such as employment laws, fair trade laws or the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Although Lexmark implements policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those business partners to which the Company outsources certain business operations, may take actions in violation of these policies. Any such violation, even if prohibited by the Company\u2019s policies, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and reputation. Because of the challenges in managing a geographically dispersed workforce, there also may be additional opportunities for employees to commit fraud or personally engage in practices which violate the policies and procedures of the Company.\nThe failure of the Company\u2019s information technology systems or the Company\u2019s failure to successfully implement new information technology systems, may negatively impact the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company depends on its information technology systems for the development, manufacture, distribution, marketing, sales and support of its products and services. Any failure in such systems, or the systems of a partner or supplier, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results. The Company also may not be successful in implementing new systems or transitioning data. Because vast quantities of the Company\u2019s products flow through only a few distribution centers to provide product to various geographic regions, the failure of information technology systems or any other disruption affecting those product distribution centers could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s ability to deliver product and on the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s reliance on international production and distribution facilities, international manufacturing partners and certain key suppliers could negatively impact the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company relies in large part on its international production facility located in Mexico and international manufacturing and distribution partners, many of which are located in China, Japan, Thailand, Brazil, Poland and the Philippines, for the manufacture of its products and key components of its products. Future operating results may be adversely affected by several factors, including, without limitation, inability of the Company\u2019s international operations or manufacturing and distribution partners to perform or supply products reliably, disruptions in international trade, trade restrictions, import duties, \u201cBuy American\u201d constraints, disruptions at important geographic points of exit and entry, difficulties in transitioning such manufacturing activities among the Company, its international operations and/or its manufacturing and distribution partners, or production and supply constraints which result in additional costs to the Company. The financial failure or loss of a sole supplier or significant supplier of products or key components, or their inability to produce the required quantities, could result in a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s operating results.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm future revenue and financial condition and increase costs and expenses.\nLexmark\u2019s worldwide operations and those of the Company\u2019s manufacturing partners, suppliers, and freight transporters, among others, are subject to natural and manmade disasters that could cause business interruptions such as earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, environmental hazards, power shortages, water shortages and telecommunications failures. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses to the Company, seriously harm the Company\u2019s revenue, profitability and financial condition and increase the Company\u2019s costs and expenses. The consolidation of certain functions into shared service centers and movement of certain functions to lower cost countries by the Company in recent years increases the probability and impact of business disruptions over time.\nIncreased competition in the Company\u2019s aftermarket supplies business may negatively impact the Company\u2019s revenue and gross margins.\nRefill, remanufactured, clones, counterfeits and other compatible alternatives for some of the Company\u2019s cartridges are available and compete with the Company\u2019s supplies business. The Company expects competitive supplies activity to increase. Various legal challenges and governmental activities may intensify competition for the Company\u2019s aftermarket supplies business.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to obtain and protect its intellectual property and defend against claims of infringement by others may negatively impact the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends in part on its ability to develop technology and obtain patents, copyrights and trademarks, and maintain trade secret protection, to protect its intellectual property against theft, infringement or other misuse by others. The Company must also conduct its operations without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Current or future claims of intellectual property infringement could prevent the Company from obtaining technology of others and could otherwise materially and adversely affect its operating results or business, as could expenses incurred by the Company in obtaining intellectual property rights, enforcing its intellectual property rights against others or defending against claims that the Company\u2019s products infringe the intellectual property rights of others, that the Company engages in false or deceptive practices or that its conduct is anti-competitive.\nTerrorist acts, acts of war or other political conflicts may negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to manufacture and sell its products.\nTerrorist attacks and the potential for future terrorist attacks have created many political and economic uncertainties, some of which may affect the Company\u2019s future operating results. Future terrorist attacks, the national and international responses to such attacks, and other acts of war or hostility may affect the Company\u2019s facilities, employees, suppliers, customers, transportation networks and supply chains, or may affect the Company in ways that are not capable of being predicted presently.\nAny variety of factors unrelated to the Company\u2019s operating performance may negatively impact the Company\u2019s operating results or the Company\u2019s stock price.\nFactors unrelated to the Company\u2019s operating performance, including the financial failure or loss of significant customers, resellers, manufacturing partners or suppliers; the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental proceedings; and the ability to retain and attract key personnel, could also adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results. In addition, the Company\u2019s stock price, like that of other technology companies, can be volatile. Trading activity in the Company\u2019s common stock, particularly the trading of large blocks and intraday trading in the Company\u2019s common stock, may affect the Company\u2019s common stock price.", "PERMNO": 82643, "SIC": 3577, "TIC": "LXK"}
