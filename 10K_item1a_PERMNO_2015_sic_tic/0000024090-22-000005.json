{"cik": "24090", "company": "CITIZENS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following discussion of risks. If any of these risks develop into actual events, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected, and, as a result, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline. These risk factors may also be important to understanding other statements in this Form 10-K. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings, Part II. Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report..\nDecember 31, 2021 | 10-K 13\nCITIZENS, INC.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nA SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM INSURANCE PRODUCTS SOLD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. WHILE OUR PRODUCTS ARE PRICED AND PAID FOR IN U.S. DOLLARS, OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS MAY SUBJECT US TO SEVERAL RISKS.\nOur sales to residents of foreign countries expose us to unknown risks related to foreign regulation, foreign currency and tax laws, and political instability. A significant loss of sales in these foreign markets would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nInternational Regulatory Risks. A substantial majority of our direct insurance premiums, approximately 68% at December 31, 2021, are from policyholders in foreign countries, primarily those in Latin America and the Pacific Rim. These policies are issued by our Bermuda subsidiary, CICA International, and are sold by independent consultants who are located in the foreign countries in which the policies are sold. Other than Bermuda, we have never registered to do business in these countries, and our products have not been approved by a governmental authority. While we have undertaken a comprehensive compliance review of risks associated with the potential application of foreign laws to our sales of insurance policies in foreign countries, the laws vary by country and there is a lack of uniform regulation and lack of clarity in certain regulations and thus we face various risks associated with the application of foreign laws to these sales.\nGenerally, all foreign countries in which we offer insurance products require either CICA International and/or our independent consultants to obtain a license or other authority to conduct insurance business in that country. Some of these countries also require that local regulatory authorities approve the terms of any insurance product sold to residents of that country. Other than Bermuda, where CICA International is domiciled, we have never sought to qualify to do business in any foreign country or jurisdiction and have never submitted the insurance policies that we issue to residents of foreign countries for approval by any insurance regulatory agency. Some foreign governments have determined under their existing laws that their residents may not purchase life insurance from us or sell life insurance on our behalf unless we become qualified to do business in that country or unless our policies receive prior approval from their insurance regulators. Others have a \"consumption abroad\" model where their residents may purchase unregistered products only if they are outside of their country when the purchase is made. There is a risk that foreign governments where we sell our products will become more aggressive in enforcing any perceived violations of their laws and seek to impose monetary fines, criminal penalties, and/or order us to cease our sales in that jurisdiction. There is no assurance that, if a foreign country were to require that we qualify to do business in that country or submit our policies for approval by that country\u2019s regulatory authorities, we would be able to, or would conclude that it is financially reasonable to comply with those requirements.\nWe have sought to mitigate the risks described above by, among other things, not locating any of our offices or assets in these foreign countries or jurisdictions, selling policies only through independent consultants rather than our own employees, requiring that all applications for insurance be submitted to and accepted only in our offices in Bermuda, and requiring that policy premiums be paid to us only in U.S. dollars. We rely on our independent consultants to comply with laws applicable to them in marketing and servicing our insurance products in their respective countries. There is no assurance that these precautionary measures, practices and policies will partially or entirely mitigate the risks associated with the potential application of foreign laws to our sales of insurance policies in our foreign markets. From time to time, insurance regulators in the foreign countries in which we operate have sought to exercise regulatory authority over the Company, including through the imposition of fines and we have chosen not to do business in certain countries, such as Brazil, due to these actions. Although the Company believes that these foreign regulators do not have jurisdiction over the Company and that any actions, including fines, may be unenforceable against the Company, any regulatory action could otherwise absorb Company time and resources away from its business operations or the Company may choose to pay such fines in order to do business in a particular country. Alternatively, the Company may determine that the risks associated with a particular market and its regulatory environment outweigh the benefits of conducting further business in that market and discontinue doing business there.\nAny actions by a foreign government to enforce these laws against us could cause disruption to the marketing and sale of our policies in that country or our withdrawal from doing business in that country, which could have a\nDecember 31, 2021 | 10-K 14\nCITIZENS, INC.\nmaterial adverse effect on our premium revenue, our costs and expenses and on our results of operations and financial condition.\nInternational Currency and Tax Risks. Currency control laws or other currency exchange restrictions in foreign countries could materially adversely affect our revenues by limiting the ability of our policyholders in such countries to pay premiums in U.S. dollars or to receive U.S. dollar benefits. Additionally, difficulties in transferring funds from or converting currencies to U.S. dollars in certain countries could cause an increase in fees and costs associated with such payments or receipt of benefits and therefore make our products less attractive to such policyholders.\nBermuda participates in the Common Reporting Standard (CRS), which is an information standard for the automatic exchange of information regarding financial accounts on a global level, among tax authorities who participate in CRS. CICA International complies with CRS reporting requirements and therefore we send required account information to certain foreign tax regulators. Taxes imposed upon our policyholders by these foreign countries may cause our products to be less attractive than other products which may be more tax-advantaged. A significant loss of sales or surrenders due to tax reporting could materially impact our business.\nInternational Political Risks. Many of the countries in which we operate have a history of political instability, including regime changes, political uprisings, and anti-democratic or anti-U.S. policies. The ability of people living in these countries to purchase and continue to make premium payments on our insurance policies and our ability to sell our policies in those countries through our independent consultants or otherwise may be adversely affected by political instability. Given the nature of our products, in an economic environment characterized by higher unemployment, lower personal income and reduced consumer spending, new product sales may be adversely affected. During such periods, we may also experience higher claims incidence, longer claims duration, increase in policy lapses and/or increase in surrenders, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, the imposition of U.S. sanctions against foreign countries where our policyholders reside could make it difficult for us to continue to issue new policies and receive premiums from policyholders in those countries.\nWe face significant competition in our international markets. If we are unable to compete effectively in these markets, our business, results of operations and profitability may be adversely affected.\nOur international marketing plan focuses on offering U.S. dollar-denominated life insurance products to individuals residing in foreign countries and we depend on the ability of our independent consultants in foreign countries to effectively distribute our products. We experience considerable competition, primarily from the following sources, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have:\n\u2022Foreign companies with U.S. dollar-denominated policies. We face direct competition from companies that operate in the same manner as we do in our international markets, including from a company recently formed by some of our former employees and independent consultants who we have sued for, among other things, unfair competition (see, Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings);\n\u2022Foreign companies with locally operated subsidiaries that are registered in those countries and offer both local jurisdiction-regulated products in local currency and off-shore U.S. dollar-denominated policies. This arrangement creates competition in that the U.S. dollar-denominated policies are cross-sold with high-need local insurance policies such as health insurance; and\n\u2022Locally operated companies with local currency policies. We compete with companies formed and operated in the country in which our foreign insureds reside.\nIn addition, from time to time, companies enter and exit the markets in which we operate, thereby increasing competition at times when there are new entrants. We may lose business to competitors offering competitive products at lower prices, or for other reasons.\nSince we rely on independent consultants for distribution of our products in foreign markets, regulation and licensing requirements imposed upon our Company may impact our ability to attract and retain effective sales representatives, who may choose to distribute products of our competitors.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in any of our markets. If we do not, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.\nDecember 31, 2021 | 10-K 15\nCITIZENS, INC.\nWe face a greater risk of money laundering activity associated with sales derived from residents of certain foreign countries.\nSome of our top international markets are in countries identified by the U.S. Department of State as jurisdictions of high risk for money laundering. As required by the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act regulations, the Bermuda Proceeds of Crime Act 1997 and the Proceeds of Crime (Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorist Financing) Regulations 2008 applicable to insurance companies, we have developed and implemented an anti-money laundering, anti-terrorist financing and sanctions program (\u201cAML/ATF and Sanctions Program\u201d) that includes policies, procedures, controls, independent testing, reporting and recordkeeping requirements for deterring, preventing and detecting potential money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud and other criminal activity in order to comply with U.S. and Bermuda laws. We have an enhanced AML/ATF and Sanctions Program with additional controls, such as watch-list screening beyond sanctions screening required by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\") and the Financial Sanctions Implementation Unit of Bermuda, enhanced payment due diligence and transaction controls. However, there can be no assurance that these enhanced controls will entirely mitigate money laundering risk associated with these jurisdictions.\nBECAUSE MOST OF OUR REVENUE DERIVES FROM COLLECTION OF PREMIUMS ON OUR PRODUCTS, OUR OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DEPENDS PRIMARILY UPON THE PRICING OF OUR INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND THE ACCURACY OF OUR PRICING ASSUMPTIONS. CHANGES IN ACTUAL EXPERIENCE, IMPROPER EVALUATION OF UNDERWRITING RISK AND MISMANAGEMENT OF CLAIMS HANDLING COULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR BENEFIT AND EXPENSE COSTS AND THUS NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on its ability to accurately underwrite risks and to charge adequate premiums to policyholders.\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition, liquidity and results of operations largely depend on the Company\u2019s ability to underwrite and set premiums accurately for the risks it faces. Premium rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premiums to cover our cost of sales, costs of operations (including payment of policy benefits) and to earn a profit. In order to price products accurately, the Company must develop and apply appropriate morbidity and mortality estimates, closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends, and project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy to cover these risks. The Company must also review and properly underwrite applications for life insurance in order to charge a sufficient premium to its policyholders. The Company\u2019s ability to undertake these efforts successfully is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation:\n\u2022availability of sufficient reliable data;\n\u2022incorrect or incomplete analysis of available data;\n\u2022uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions;\n\u2022selection and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies;\n\u2022adoption of successful pricing strategies;\n\u2022prediction of policyholder life expectancy and retention;\n\u2022unforeseen events that may cause our estimates to be wrong (such as the COVID-19 pandemic);\n\u2022unanticipated legislation, regulatory action or court decisions; or\n\u2022unexpected changes in interest rates or inflation.\nSuch risks may result in the Company\u2019s pricing being based on outdated, inadequate, or inaccurate data, or inappropriate analyses, assumptions, or methodologies, and may cause the Company to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims. As a result, the Company could underprice risks, which would negatively affect the Company\u2019s margins, or it could overprice risks, which could reduce the Company\u2019s volume and competitiveness. The Company\u2019s ability to accurately underwrite risks in insurance products depends in part on its ability to forecast such changes and trends. If it is not successful in doing so, the Company\u2019s operating results, financial condition, and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.\nDecember 31, 2021 | 10-K 16\nCITIZENS, INC.\nPricing accuracy depends upon our ability to project future losses based on historical loss experience, including policyholder retention. Unanticipated increases in early policyholder withdrawals or surrenders or elections by policyholders to receive lump sum payouts at maturity could negatively impact liquidity.\nA primary liquidity concern is the risk of unanticipated or extraordinary early policyholder withdrawals or surrenders. Our insurance policies include provisions, such as surrender charges, that help limit and discourage early withdrawals. We also track and manage liabilities and align our investment portfolio in an effort to maintain sufficient liquidity to support anticipated withdrawal demands. However, early withdrawal and surrender levels may differ from anticipated levels for a variety of reasons, including changes in economic conditions, changes in policyholder behavior or financial needs, changes in relationships with our independent consultants, efforts by foreign governments to tax policyholders or increases in surrenders among policies that have been in force for more than fifteen years and are no longer subject to surrender charges.\nIn addition, we face potential liquidity risks if policyholders with mature policies elect to receive lump sum distributions at greater levels than anticipated. Our whole life and endowment products provide the policyholder with alternatives once the policy matures. The policyholder can choose to take a lump sum payout or leave the money on deposit at interest with the Company. The Company has a significant amount of aging endowment products that have begun reaching their maturities and policyholder election behavior is not known. It is uncertain how policyholders will react in response to these maturities. If a large number of policyholders elect lump sum distributions, the Company could be exposed to liquidity risk in years of high maturities.\nIf we experience unanticipated early withdrawal or surrender activity or greater than expected lump sum distributions of endowment maturities and we do not have sufficient cash flow from our insurance operations to support payment of these benefits, we may have to sell our investments in order to meet our cash needs or be forced to obtain third-party financing. The availability of such financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as market conditions, the availability of credit in general or more specifically in the insurance industry, the strength or weakness of the capital markets, the volume of trading activities, our credit capacity, and the perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if we incur large realized or unrealized investment losses or if the level of business activity declines due to a market downturn. Therefore, if we are forced to sell our investments on unfavorable terms or obtain financing with unfavorable terms, it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur largest expense is payments of claims and surrenders to our policyholders. Mismanagement of claims handling or increased fraudulent claims could negatively impact our costs and financial condition.\nProper claims handling is critical to managing our benefit expenses. Many factors can affect the Company\u2019s ability to pay claims accurately, including the following:\n\u2022the training, experience, and skill of the Company\u2019s claims representatives;\n\u2022the extent of fraudulent claims and the Company\u2019s ability to recognize and respond to such claims;\n\u2022the claims organization\u2019s culture and the effectiveness of its management, and\n\u2022the Company\u2019s ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures, technologies, and systems to support claims functions.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to pay claims fairly, accurately, and in a timely manner, or to deploy claims resources appropriately, could result in unanticipated costs, lead to material litigation, undermine customer goodwill and the Company\u2019s reputation in the marketplace, impair its brand image and, as a result, materially and adversely affect its competitiveness, financial results, prospects, and liquidity.\nHigher than expected policyholder claims related to unforeseen events may negatively impact our sales, increase our benefits and expense costs and increase our reinsurance costs, thus negatively affecting our financial condition.\nOur insurance operations are exposed to the risk of unforeseen events that could cause our pricing assumptions to be wrong. Two of these unforeseen events and the risks they pose to our business are described below:\nDecember 31, 2021 | 10-K 17\nCITIZENS, INC.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is negatively impacting certain aspects of our business and, depending on severity and duration, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and overall business operations.\nThe prolonged COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption to the global economy and business operations and has resulted in unfavorable impacts to our Company as well as other companies the insurance industry. Due to the unprecedented nature of these events and the uncertainty surrounding the virus and its several variants and their impacts, we cannot fully estimate the duration or full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. However, we have identified several areas where the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our business during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Events that we are unable to control, such as the spread of new variants (e.g., Delta, Omicron), spikes in the number of cases of COVID-19, lower than expected vaccination rates in certain areas and the related responses by government authorities and businesses, may continue to present unforeseen risks to our business. We are closely monitoring developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic to assess its impacts on our business.\nSome of the most significant risks related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic include the following:\n\u2022a higher level of claims due to COVID-19 deaths; and\n\u2022decreased premium revenue due to disruption to our workforce or distribution channel resulting from required isolation, travel limitations and business restrictions; and\n\u2022higher surrenders and lapses due to cash needs our policyholders may have due to concerns over COVID-19 economic impacts, particularly in our international business; and\n\u2022volatility in our investment portfolio due to market disruptions caused by COVID-19 related concerns such as inflation.\nWhile we utilize an Enterprise Risk Management framework to manage potential crisis scenarios, we do not know the long-term impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our business. Some potential future risks include (i) the adequacy of our pricing assumptions due to long-term effects of COVID-19, (ii) our ability to adequately underwrite risks related to COVID-19 survivors, and (iii) our ability to ensure the safety of our employees and potential lawsuits related to safety and/or workplace policies. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to reliance on digital distribution and development of digital sales and service platforms in order to offset social distancing measures and thus our ability to develop and maintain these platforms and protect them from cyber risk is critical to our ongoing success.\nWhile governmental and non-governmental organizations are continuing to engage in efforts to combat the spread and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health issues, these measures may not be effective. We cannot predict how legal and regulatory responses to concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health issues will impact our business. Such events or conditions could result in additional regulation or restrictions affecting the conduct of our business or results of operations in the future.\nClimate Change and Impact on Natural Catastrophes\nThe extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Most catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas; however, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis and man-made catastrophes may produce significant damage or loss of life in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. SPFIC sells property insurance policies in Louisiana. The vast majority of SPFIC\u2019s claims have arisen out of natural catastrophes such as Hurricane Laura and Hurricane Delta, which both hit Louisiana in 2020, and most recently, Hurricane Ida, a category 4 hurricane that hit the coast of Louisiana in August 2021. Climate change, including rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns, could impact storm frequency and severity in our coverage areas, which could materially impact our financial performance as the volume and severity of claims also continues to rise. Furthermore, since we obtain catastrophic storm reinsurance, storm frequency could cause us to have to obtain additional reinsurance, which negatively impacts our premium revenue. Since we operate in a highly regulated and competitive environment, we may not be able to raise our rates sufficiently to recoup our losses. Additionally, the volume and severity of storms increases the risks of writing property insurance in coastal areas, which could cause us to change our business model, negatively impacting our revenue and earnings.\nDecember 31, 2021 | 10-K 18\nCITIZENS, INC.\nOur actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims and we may be required to establish additional reserves, which in turn may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe maintain reserves to cover our estimated exposure for claims relating to our issued insurance policies. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of exposure, but instead represent our best estimates using actuarial and statistical procedures. Reserve estimates are refined as experience develops, and adjustments to reserves are reflected in our statements of operations for the period in which such estimates are updated. Because establishing reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses, future developments may require us to increase policy benefit reserves, which restricts our use of cash to the extent of such increased reserves and increases expenses, negatively affecting our results of operations and financial condition in the periods in which such increases occur.\nWe may be required to accelerate the amortization of deferred acquisition costs, which would increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had $140.4 million of deferred policy acquisition costs, or DAC. DAC represents costs that are directly related to the successful sale and issuance of our insurance policies, which costs are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the related insurance policies. These costs include commissions in excess of ultimate renewal commissions, solicitation and printing costs, sales material costs and some support costs, such as underwriting and contract and policy issuance expenses.\nUnder U.S. GAAP for our type of insurance products, DAC is amortized over the premium-paying period of the policies. Because DAC is amortized over such period, unexpected changes from our assumptions that shorten the premium-paying period, such as increased lapse and surrender rates, or lower persistency in the early years of a policy, would cause us to have to accelerate the amortization of DAC. We regularly review the quality of our DAC to determine if it is recoverable from future income. If these costs are not recoverable, the amount that is not recoverable is charged to expenses in the financial period in which we make this determination. Unfavorable experience with regards to expected expenses, investment returns, surrender and other policy charges, mortality, morbidity, lapses or persistency may cause us to increase the amortization of DAC or to record a current period expense to increase benefit reserves, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nTHE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH INDEPENDENT CONSULTANTS REDUCES OUR CONTROL OVER SALES AND DISTRIBUTION AND THUS SUBJECTS US TO CERTAIN RISKS THAT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REVENUES, OUR IN-FORCE BUSINESS, AND OUR BENEFITS AND EXPENSE COSTS.\nSales of our insurance products could decline if we are unable to establish and maintain relationships with independent marketing agencies and independent consultants and agents.\nWe depend almost exclusively on the services of independent marketing agencies and independent consultants and agents for the distribution of our products. These agencies, agents and consultants are key to the development and maintenance of our relationships with our policyholders. Significant competition exists among insurers in attracting and maintaining marketers of demonstrated ability. Some of our competitors may offer better compensation packages or commissions or induce agents to sell their products due to their broader product offerings, more distribution resources, better brand recognition, more competitive pricing, lower cost structures or greater financial strength or claims paying ratings than we have. We compete with other insurers for marketing agencies, agents and independent consultants primarily on the basis of our compensation, products and support services. Any reduction in our ability to attract and retain effective sales representatives could materially adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, as we disclosed in Item 3. Legal Proceedings, we are subject to a risk of our independent consultants leaving our Company to sell products for a competitor and inducing our policyholders to lapse or surrender their policies, or otherwise terminate their relationship with us, in order to purchase products from the independent consultant with our competitor company.\nDecember 31, 2021 | 10-K 19\nCITIZENS, INC.\nThere may be adverse tax, legal or financial consequences if our sales representatives are determined not to be independent consultants.\nOur sales representatives are independent consultants who operate their own businesses. Although we believe that we have properly classified our representatives as independent consultants, there is nevertheless a risk that the IRS, a foreign agency, a court or other authority will take the different view that our sales representatives should be classified as employees. The tests governing the determination of whether an individual is considered to be an independent consultant or an employee are typically fact-sensitive and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Laws and regulations that govern the status and misclassification of independent sales representatives are subject to change and interpretation.\nIf there is a change in the manner in which our independent consultants are classified or an adverse determination with respect to some or all of our independent consultants by a court or governmental agency, we could incur significant costs in complying with such laws and regulations, including in respect of tax withholding, social security payments, government and private pension plan contributions and recordkeeping, or we may be required to modify our business model, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there is the risk that we may be subject to significant monetary liabilities arising from fines or judgments as a result of any such actual or alleged non-compliance with applicable federal, state, local or foreign laws.\nINSURANCE IS A HIGHLY REGULATED BUSINESS. REGULATIONS VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION AND MAY CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME. THESE REGULATIONS AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND CHANGES COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR CASH FLOW, THE RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS, OUR LIQUIDITY AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nLEGAL REGULATION AND RISKS\nIn addition to the legal risks related to our international operations discussed above in this Item 1A, Risk Factors, we are subject to risks related to the laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we are domiciled and registered to do business, including Bermuda and various U.S. states. These material risks are described below.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements, and any failure to meet these requirements could subject us to regulatory action or other restrictions.\nThe capacity for an insurance company's growth in premiums is partially a function of its required statutory surplus. Maintaining appropriate levels of statutory surplus, as measured by statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by a company's jurisdiction of domicile, is considered important by insurance regulatory authorities. Failure to maintain required levels of statutory surplus could result in increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement action by regulatory authorities.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements in both the U.S. and Bermuda, as described below. If we fail to meet these standards and requirements, our various regulators may require specified actions to be taken, including without limitation:\n\u2022restricting distributions from our subsidiaries to Citizens; or\n\u2022requiring Citizens to contribute additional capital to a subsidiary; or\n\u2022requiring Citizens to enter into a guaranty or other agreement to contribute capital to such subsidiary under certain circumstances;\nall of which could have a material and adverse impact on the Company\u2019s competitiveness, operational flexibility, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, failure to maintain certain levels of statutory surplus could result in increased regulatory scrutiny or action by regulatory authorities.\nIn April 2021, Citizens and CICA International entered into a Keep Well Agreement, as described in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital\nDecember 31, 2021 | 10-K 20\nCITIZENS, INC.\nResources. If CICA International's minimum capital level fell below the minimum required by the BMA, Citizens may have to contribute capital to CICA International, which could negatively impact our capital resources and liquidity.\nCitizens is a holding company that has minimal operations of its own and depends on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make service payments to us in sufficient amounts to fund our operations. If they cannot make such payments, Citizens may need to sell its investments or seek external capital to cover its operational costs.\nAs a holding company, our assets consist of the capital stock of our subsidiaries, cash and investments. Accordingly, we rely primarily on statutorily permissible payments from our insurance company subsidiaries, principally through dividends or service agreements we have with our subsidiaries, to meet our working capital needs. As discussed above, the ability of our insurance company subsidiaries to make payments to us is subject to regulation by the states and jurisdictions in which they are domiciled, and in addition to maintaining minimum capital and surplus ratios, these payments depend primarily on regulatory approval of dividend payments and approved service agreements between us and these subsidiaries.\nExcept to the extent that we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, claims of our subsidiaries' creditors, including policyholders, have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiaries over the claims of other creditors (including us) and shareholders. If any of our subsidiaries becomes insolvent, liquidates or otherwise reorganizes, our policyholders will have a priority to receive the assets of such subsidiary and Citizens may have no rights to receive cash or other assets of such subsidiaries.\nIf our internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient to cover our holding company operations, we may have to sell investments earlier than we want to sell them or in less than favorable market conditions, or we may have to seek external sources of capital. Out of an abundance of caution, in May 2021, we entered into a Credit Facility with Regions Bank. See Part IV, Item 1, Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, herein, for a description of the Credit Facility. To date, we have not utilized the Credit Facility, but if internal sources of capital are not sufficient to meet our operating needs, we may need to utilize the Credit Facility or increase the borrowing availability under the Credit Facility. We may also need to raise capital through issuing our stock. Borrowing money, increasing our borrowing availability under the Credit Facility or obtaining financing for even a small amount of capital could be challenging or expensive in unfavorable market conditions and during periods of economic uncertainty. The availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, and the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our financial prospects. Raising capital in unfavorable market conditions could increase our interest expense or negatively impact our shareholders through dilution of their common stock ownership of the Company.\nCitizens and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive governmental regulation in Bermuda and in the U.S. The rules and regulations to which we are subject may change and impose greater restrictions on our business, which could increase our costs of doing business, restrict the conduct of our business, increase capital requirements for our insurance subsidiaries and negatively impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nCICA International is registered in Bermuda and is subject to regulation by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (\"BMA\") and the provisions of the Bermuda Insurance Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as other laws which apply to Bermuda-based companies, such as compliance with Common Reporting Standards, which are administered by the Bermuda Ministry of Finance (\"MOF\"). Citizens and our domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in U.S. jurisdictions where we are domiciled and where we do business. These rules and regulations require us to comply with privacy, anti-money laundering, bank secrecy, anti-corruption and foreign asset control laws among others.\nIn the U.S., we are subject to federal laws, as well as state-level regulation, including a requirement to obtain approval of forms and rates in the states we sell our insurance policies. Insurance company regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders, with substantially lesser protections to shareholders of the regulated insurance companies. To that end, all the U.S. states in which we do business have insurance regulatory agencies with broad legal powers with respect to licensing companies to transact business, mandating capital and surplus requirements, regulating claims practices, approving service agreements between a holding company and\nDecember 31, 2021 | 10-K 21\nCITIZENS, INC.\nits operating subsidiary, restricting companies' ability to enter and exit markets, and restricting or prohibiting the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us.\nThe BMA and most U.S. insurance regulatory authorities have broad discretion to grant, renew, suspend and revoke licenses and approvals, and could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities, including acquisitions of other insurance companies, require us to add capital to our insurance company subsidiaries, or fine us. If we are unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals, or if our insurance business is determined not to comply fully with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations and their interpretations, our revenues, results of operations and financial condition and our reputation could be materially adversely affected.\nFINANCIAL REGULATION AND RISKS\nChanges in accounting standards may adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial condition.\nOur consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP in the U.S. and Bermuda, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\"), the BMA and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\"NAIC\"). Future accounting standards we adopt, including the FASB\u2019s Accounting Standard Update related to long-duration insurance contracts (known as LDTI), will change current accounting and disclosure requirements applicable to our consolidated financial statements. Such changes may have a material effect on our reported results of operations or financial condition. In addition, the required adoption of new accounting standards may result in significant incremental costs associated with initial implementation and ongoing compliance. See Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained herein for additional information regarding accounting updates.\nUnexpected losses in future reporting periods may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, we are required to evaluate our deferred tax assets (\"DTA\") quarterly for recoverability based on available evidence. This process involves management's judgment about assumptions, which are subject to change from period to period due to tax rate changes or variances between our projected operating performance and our actual results. Ultimately, future adjustments to the DTA valuation allowance, if any, will be determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets. The realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carry back or carry forward periods under applicable tax law. Due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we may be required to record a valuation allowance in future reporting periods. Such an adjustment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.\nAPPROXIMATELY 25% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021 CONSISTED OF INVESTMENT INCOME. THE INVESTMENT RETURN, OR YIELD, ON INVESTED ASSETS IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR EARNINGS SINCE INSURANCE PRODUCTS ARE PRICED WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT PREMIUMS RECEIVED CAN BE INVESTED FOR A PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE BENEFITS ARE PAID. CHANGES IN THE GLOBAL OR U.S. INVESTMENT ENVIRONMENT, OR MARKET DISRUPTIONS THAT AFFECT INTEREST RATES AND INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES, AS WELL AS DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATION AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nSustained periods of low interest rates in the long-term investment market may adversely affect our reported net investment income and the discount rates used in reserving for our insurance products, which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe low interest rate environment continues to limit increases in profit margins for insurers, including us. We have been impacted by the historically low interest rate environment over the past several years as our fixed maturity investment portfolio, primarily invested in callable securities, has generally been reinvested at lower yields, leading to lower net investment income than assumed in the pricing and reserving for our insurance products. An interest or\nDecember 31, 2021 | 10-K 22\nCITIZENS, INC.\ndiscount rate is used in calculating reserves for our insurance products. We set our reserve discount rate assumptions based on our current and expected future investment yield for assets supporting the reserves, considering current and expected future market conditions. Spread compression and related effects to profitability caused by lower interest rates affect the valuation of in-force business more significantly than the valuation of new business, as new business pricing assumptions reflect the current and anticipated future interest rate environment. Estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent management\u2019s reasonable expectations regarding future developments. If the discount rate assumed in our reserve calculations is higher than our future investment returns, our invested assets will not earn enough investment income to support our future benefit payments. In that case, we may be required to amortize any remaining DAC, record additional liabilities and/or increase our capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries in the period this occurs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nChanges in market interest rates may significantly affect our profitability.\nWe are exposed to significant capital market risk related to changes in interest rates. Our investment performance, including yields and realization of gains and losses, may vary depending on economic and market conditions. Substantial and sustained changes, up or down, in market interest rate levels can materially affect the profitability of our products.\nIf interest rates decrease or remain at low levels, we may be forced to reinvest proceeds from investments that have matured, prepaid, been sold, or called at lower yields, reducing our investment margin. We have experienced significant call activity on our fixed maturity portfolio over the years due to the low interest rate environment. Our fixed maturity bond portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk as approximately 52% of the portfolio is callable as of December 31, 2021, with 4% that could be called within the next year. If subject to increased call activity, the Company would have to reinvest the resulting investment portfolio cash proceeds from calls as well as from maturities in lower yielding instruments, further reducing our investment income. Some of our products, principally traditional whole life insurance with annuity riders, expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce our \"spread,\" or the difference between the amounts we are required to pay under our contracts to policyholders and the rate of return we are able to earn on our investments intended to support obligations under the contracts. As a key component of profitability, a narrowing of our \u201cspread\u201d may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Lowering our interest crediting rates can help offset decreases in investment margins on some of our products. However, our ability to lower these rates could be limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields.\nAn increase in interest rates will decrease the net unrealized gain position of our investment portfolio and may subject us to disintermediation risk. Disintermediation risk is the risk that in a change from a low interest rate period to a significantly higher and increasing interest rate period, policyholders may surrender their policies or make early withdrawals to increase their returns, requiring us to liquidate investments in an unrealized loss position (i.e. the market value less the carrying value of the investments).\nOur investment portfolio is subject to various risks that may result in investment related losses. In particular, decreases in the fair value of fixed maturities may significantly reduce the value of our investments, and as a result, our financial condition may suffer.\nWe are subject to credit risk in our investment portfolio. Defaults by third parties in the payment or performance of their obligations under these securities could reduce our investment income and investment related gains or result in the recognition of investment losses. The value of our investments may be materially adversely affected by increases in interest rates, downgrades in the bonds included in our portfolio and by other factors that may result in the recognition of credit related allowances. Each of these events may cause us to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio.\nIn particular, at December 31, 2021, fixed maturities represented $1.5 billion or 90.6% of our total investments of $1.6 billion. The fair value of fixed maturities and the related investment income fluctuates depending on general economic and market conditions. The fair value of these investments generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by us will generally increase or decrease in line with changes in market interest rates. In addition, actual net investment income and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations. An investment has\nDecember 31, 2021 | 10-K 23\nCITIZENS, INC.\nprepayment risk when there is a risk that the timing of cash flows resulting from the repayment of principal might occur earlier than anticipated because of declining interest rates or later than anticipated because of rising interest rates. The impact of value fluctuations affects our consolidated financial statements, as all of our fixed maturities are classified as available-for-sale, with changes in fair value reflected in our stockholders' equity (accumulated other comprehensive income or loss). No similar adjustment is made for liabilities to reflect a change in interest rates. Therefore, interest rate fluctuations and economic conditions could adversely affect our stockholders' equity, total comprehensive income and/or cash flows. Although 98.0% of our fixed maturities were investment grade with 59.5% rated A or above at December 31, 2021, all of our fixed maturities are subject to credit risk. If any of the issuers of our fixed maturities suffer financial setbacks, the ratings on the fixed maturities could be downgraded (with a concurrent decrease in fair value) and, in a worst-case scenario, the issuer could default on its financial obligations. If the issuer defaults, we could have realized losses associated with the impairment of the securities.\nThe determination of valuation and impairments of our investments include estimations and assumptions that are subjective and prone to differing interpretations and could materially impact our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Company makes assumptions regarding the fair value and expected performance of its fixed maturity securities and other investments. Valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation, particularly during periods of market disruption, resulting in values which may be less than the value at which the investments may ultimately be sold. Further, rapidly changing and/or unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of investments as reported in our consolidated financial statements, and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. Decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe decision of whether to record a credit impairment is determined by our assessment of the financial condition and prospects of a particular issuer, projections of future cash flows and recoverability as well as our ability and intent to hold the securities to recovery or maturity. We evaluate our investment portfolio for impairments. There can be no assurance that we have accurately assessed the level of impairments taken. Additional impairments may need to be taken in the future, and historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments. Any event reducing the value of our securities other than on a temporary basis may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nFROM TIME TO TIME, WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR BUSINESS BY PURCHASING OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES OR BLOCKS OF BUSINESS. SUCH ACQUISITIONS SUBJECT US TO POTENTIAL RISKS THAT COULD MATERIALLY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nWe may be required to accelerate the costs of insurance acquired, which would increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWhen we acquire a block of insurance policies, we assign a portion of the purchase price to the right to receive future net cash flows from existing insurance and investment contracts and policies. This intangible asset, called the cost of insurance acquired, or COIA, represents the actuarially estimated present value of future cash flows from the acquired policies. At December 31, 2021, we had $10.6 million of COIA.\nWe amortize the value of this intangible asset in a manner similar to the amortization of DAC; it is subject to acceleration and generally depends upon anticipated profits from investments, surrender and other policy charges, mortality, morbidity, persistency and maintenance expense margins. If actual experience was not as expected when the policies were acquired, we might be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy. We regularly review the quality of our COIA to determine if it is recoverable from future income. If these costs are not recoverable, the amount that is not recoverable is charged to expenses in the financial period in which we make this determination.\nUnfavorable experience with regards to expected expenses, investment returns, surrender and other policy charges, mortality, morbidity, lapses or persistency may cause us to increase the amortization of COIA, or to record a current period expense to increase benefit reserves, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nDecember 31, 2021 | 10-K 24\nCITIZENS, INC.\nTHE COMPANY RELIES ON OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, AND THE DATA MAINTAINED WITHIN THOSE SYSTEMS, TO MANAGE MANY ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS. CYBERSECURITY RISKS, THE FAILURE OF OUR SYSTEMS TO OPERATE PROPERLY AND/OR THE FAILURE TO MAINTAIN THE CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY, AND AVAILABILITY OF POLICYHOLDER AND CLAIMS DATA, INCLUDING PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION, COULD RESULT IN A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, REPUTATION, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOur failure to maintain effective information systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe must maintain and enhance our existing information systems and develop and integrate new information systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences in a cost-effective manner. If we do not maintain adequate systems, we could experience adverse consequences, including inadequate information on which to base pricing, underwriting and reserve decisions, regulatory problems, failure to meet prompt payment obligations, increases in administrative expenses and loss of customers. Our failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems, or our failure to consolidate our existing systems could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nSome of our information technology systems and software are mainframe-based, legacy-type systems that require an ongoing commitment of resources to maintain current standards. Our systems utilize proprietary code requiring highly skilled personnel. Due to the unique nature of our proprietary operating environment, we could have difficulty finding personnel with the skills required to provide ongoing system maintenance and development as we seek to keep pace with changes in our products and business models, information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and policyholder needs.\nWe are continuously evaluating and enhancing systems and creating new systems and processes as our business depends on our ability to maintain and improve our technology. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our systems and processes, these changes, as well as changes designed to update and enhance our protective measures to address new threats, increase the risk of a system or process failure or the creation of a gap in our security measures. Any such failure or gap could adversely affect our business operations and results of operations.\nA cyber attack or other security breach could disrupt our operations, result in the unauthorized disclosure or loss of confidential data, damage our reputation or relationships, and expose us to significant financial and legal liability, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe store confidential information about our business and our policyholders, independent marketing firms, and independent agents, consultants and others on our information technology systems, including proprietary and personally identifiable information. As part of our normal business operations, we use this information and engage third-party providers, including outsourcing, cloud computing, and other business partners, that store, access, process, and transmit such information on our behalf. We devote significant resources and employ security measures to help protect our information technology systems and confidential information, and we have programs in place to detect, contain, and respond to information security incidents. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we and our third-party providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties or through open source solutions may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise our information security. Unauthorized parties, whether within or outside our company, may disrupt or gain access to our systems, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through human error, misfeasance, fraud, trickery, or other forms of deceit, including break-ins, use of stolen credentials, social engineering, phishing, or other cyber attacks, computer viruses, malicious codes, and similar means of unauthorized and destructive tampering.\nWe and our third-party providers experience information security incidents from time to time. There is no assurance that our security systems and measures will be able to prevent, mitigate, or remediate future incidents. A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of our information technology systems, or those of third parties with whom we do business, could cause serious negative consequences for us, including significant disruption of our operations, unauthorized disclosure or loss of confidential information, harm to our brand or reputation, loss of customers and revenues, violations of privacy and other laws, and exposure to litigation, monetary damages,\nDecember 31, 2021 | 10-K 25\nCITIZENS, INC.\nregulatory enforcement proceedings, fines, and potentially criminal proceedings and penalties. If we are unaware of the incident for some time after it occurs, our exposure could increase. In addition, the costs to address or remediate systems disruptions or security threats or vulnerabilities, whether before or after an incident, could be significant. As we continue to build our digital capabilities and focus on enhancing the customer experience, the amount of information that we retain and share with third parties is likely to grow, increasing the cost to prevent data security breaches and the cost and potential consequences of such breaches. An information technology systems failure could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements, exposing us to potential disciplinary action by regulators.\nAlthough we have insurance against some cyber risks and attacks, we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that exceed our policy limits, are subject to deductibles or are not covered under any of our current insurance policies.\nThe failure of our business recovery and incident management processes to resume our business operations in the event of a catastrophe, an epidemic, a cyber attack, or other event could adversely affect our profitability, results of operations, or financial condition.\nIn the event of a disaster such as a catastrophe, an epidemic, a cyber attack, cyber security breach or other information technology systems failure, a terrorist attack, or war, unanticipated problems with our disaster recovery systems could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial condition, particularly if those problems affect our information technology systems and destroy valuable data or result in a significant failure of our internal control environment. In addition, in the event that a significant number of our employees were unavailable in the event of a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct business could be severely compromised.\nThe failure of our information technology and/or disaster recovery systems for any reason could cause significant interruptions or malfunctions in our or our customers\u2019 operations and result in the loss, theft, or failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data, including personal information relating to our customers. Such a failure could harm our reputation, subject us to regulatory sanctions, legal claims, and increased expenses, and lead to a loss of customers and revenues.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR HOLDING SECURITIES\nThe number and location of our shareholders may make it difficult to obtain approval of certain corporate actions.\nBecause we allow our policyholders to use their policy dividends to purchase our Class A common stock through our CISIP, we have over 86,000 shareholders and approximately 40% of our shareholders hold less than 100 shares each. Additionally, many of these shareholders are located in Latin America and the Pacific Rim, where most of our policies are sold, and English may not be their native language. We believe that because of this, we typically have low voter turn-out at our annual meetings and therefore any proposal, such as one related to a merger or an acquisition of our Company, or an amendment to our articles of incorporation, that may require the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock, may be logistically difficult to approve.\nOur Class A common stock is not registered in any foreign country.\nAs mentioned above, a significant portion of our Class A common stock has been purchased under the CISIP by foreign holders of life insurance policies. The Class A common stock sold under the CISIP is registered with the SEC pursuant to a Form S-3 registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 but is not registered under the laws of any foreign jurisdiction. If a foreign securities regulatory authority were to determine the offer and sale of our Class A common stock under the CISIP was not allowed under applicable laws and regulations of its jurisdiction, such authority may issue or assert a fine, penalty or cease and desist order against our offer and sale of Class A common stock in that foreign jurisdiction. There is a risk our Class A common stock price could be negatively impacted by a decrease in participation in the CISIP.\nDecember 31, 2021 | 10-K 26\nCITIZENS, INC.\nApplicable insurance laws in the jurisdictions where our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interests.\nInsurance laws in the jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled require regulatory actions for certain transactions, such as a merger or acquisition of our Company, that our shareholders might consider in their best interests. As previously described, the insurance regulators consider the best interests of our policyholders over the best interests of our shareholders. As a result, our shareholders may be prevented from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our Class A common stock that may be offered by a bidder in a takeover context or such regulatory approval requirement may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a takeover attempt or a change in control.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nLitigation and regulatory actions and investigations are common in our businesses and may result in financial losses and/or harm to our reputation.\nFrom time to time we are, and have been, subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions and investigations relating to our business operations. We are, and in the future may be, parties in various litigation matters. An adverse outcome in one or more of these actions, investigations or litigation matters may, depending on the nature, scope and amount of the ruling, materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition, encourage other litigation, and limit our ability to write new business, particularly if the adverse outcomes negatively impact our reputation.\nIn the absence of countervailing considerations, we would expect to defend any such actions, investigations or litigation matters vigorously. However, in doing so, we could incur significant defense costs, including attorneys' fees, other direct litigation costs and the expenditure of substantial amounts of management time that otherwise would be devoted to our business. Further, if we suffer an adverse judgment as a result of any claim, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nReinsurance may not be available or affordable, or reinsurers may be unwilling or unable to meet their obligations under our reinsurance contracts, which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nAs part of our overall risk management and capital management strategies, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various insurance subsidiaries. Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of reinsurance. Any decrease in the amount of reinsurance will increase our risk of loss and may impact the level of capital requirements for our insurance subsidiaries, and any increase in the cost of reinsurance will, absent a decrease in the amount of reinsurance, reduce our results of operations. Accordingly, we may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may be unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms, which may adversely affect our ability to write future business, result in the assumption of more risk with respect to the policies we issue, and increase our capital requirements. The collectability of our reinsurance recoverable is primarily a function of the solvency of the individual reinsurers. We cannot provide assurance that our reinsurers will pay the reinsurance recoverable owed to us or that they will pay these recoverables on a timely basis. The insolvency of a reinsurer or the inability or unwillingness of a reinsurer to comply with the terms of a reinsurance contract may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nEvents that damage our reputation may adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nThere are many events which may harm our reputation, including, but not limited to, those discussed in this Item 1A regarding regulatory investigations, legal proceedings, cyber or other information security incidents and disputes with our independent agents and consultants.\nIn addition, as an insurance company, we are paid to accept certain risks. Those who conduct our business, including executive officers and members of management, and to some extent, independent agents and consultants, do so in part by making decisions that involve exposing us to risk. These include decisions such as maintaining effective underwriting and pricing discipline, maintaining effective claim management and customer\nDecember 31, 2021 | 10-K 27\nCITIZENS, INC.\nservice performance, managing our investment portfolio, delivering effective technology solutions, complying with established sales practices, executing our capital management strategy, exiting a line of business and/or pursuing strategic growth initiatives, and other decisions. Although we have a risk management framework and employ controls and procedures designed to monitor business decisions and prevent us from taking excessive risks or unintentionally failing to comply with internal policies and practices such that errors occur, there can be no assurance that these controls and procedures will be effective. If our employees and independent agents and consultants take excessive risks and/or fail to comply with internal policies and practices, the impact of those events may damage our market position and reputation.\nDepending on the severity of the damage to our reputation, we may be unable to effectively compete for new products or retain our existing business, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Damage to our reputation may also hinder our ability to raise new capital and/or increase our cost of capital.", "PERMNO": 23799, "SIC": 6311, "TIC": "CIA"}
