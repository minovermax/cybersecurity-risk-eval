{"cik": "878560", "company": "CalAtlantic Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on Form 10-K should be read together with the risk factors set forth below. They describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks which we cannot foresee at this time, have the potential to affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies and prospects in a material and adverse manner.\nMarket and Economic Risks\nAdverse economic conditions negatively impact the demand for homes. A negative change in economic conditions could have adverse effects on our operating results and financial condition.\nThe homebuilding industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as the level of employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability of financing and interest rate levels. From approximately 2007 to 2011, the national recession, credit market disruption, high unemployment levels, absence of home price stability, and decreased availability of mortgage financing, among other factors, adversely impacted the homebuilding industry and our operations and financial condition. Although the housing market has recovered in most of the geographies in which we operate, if market conditions deteriorate, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nThe market value and availability of land may fluctuate significantly, which could decrease the value of our developed and undeveloped land holdings and limit our ability to develop new communities.\nThe risk of owning developed and undeveloped land can be substantial for us. Our strategy calls for us to continue to invest a substantial portion of our cash in land. The market value of the undeveloped land, buildable lots and housing inventories we hold can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing economic and market conditions. During the national recession, we experienced negative economic and market conditions that resulted in the impairment of a significant number of our land positions and write-offs of some of our land option deposits. If economic or market conditions deteriorate in the future, we may have to impair our land holdings and projects, write down our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, write off option deposits, sell homes or land at a loss, and/or hold land or homes in inventory longer than planned. In addition, inventory carrying costs (such as property taxes and interest) can be significant, particularly if inventory must be held for longer than planned, which can trigger asset impairments in poorly performing projects or markets. As we increase the amount of land we hold, we also increase our exposure to the risks associated with owning land, which means that if economic and market conditions were to deteriorate, it could have a significantly greater adverse impact on our financial condition.\nOur long-term success also depends upon the continued availability of suitable land at acceptable prices. The availability of land for purchase at acceptable prices depends on a number of factors outside of our control, including the risk of competitive over-bidding of land prices and restrictive governmental regulation. If a sufficient amount of suitable land opportunities do not become available, it could limit our ability to develop new communities, increase our land costs and negatively impact our sales and earnings.\nCustomers may be unwilling or unable to purchase our homes at times when mortgage-financing costs are high or when credit is difficult to obtain.\nThe majority of our homebuyers finance their new home purchase. In general, housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates and by decreases in the availability of mortgage financing. Interest rates have been at historic lows for the last 7 years and, Corelogic, an aggregator of mortgage data, estimates that 66% of homeowners have mortgages with rates at or below 4.5%. With mortgage rates widely anticipated to increase over the next several years, it is possible that homeowners with low interest rate mortgages may choose to remain in their current homes rather than purchase a new home in a higher interest rate environment. In addition, underwriting standards remain tight, with lenders requiring high credit scores, substantial down payments and cash reserves, and the availability of subprime and other alternative mortgage products, which are important to sales in many of our markets, remains limited. The availability of mortgage financing is also affected by changes in liquidity in the secondary mortgage market and the market for mortgage-backed securities, which are directly impacted by the federal government's decisions regarding its financial support of the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the entities that provide liquidity to the secondary market. If\nthe availability and cost of mortgage financing deteriorates, the ability and willingness of prospective buyers to finance home purchases or to sell their existing homes could be adversely affected, which could adversely affect our operating results and profitability.\nThe homebuilding industry is competitive and the business practices of homebuilders and other home sellers have the potential to negatively impact our sales and earnings.\nThe homebuilding industry is fragmented and highly competitive. We compete with numerous other residential construction companies, including large national and regional firms, for customers, land, financing, raw materials, skilled labor and employees. Several of our larger competitors, because of their scale, may have lower costs of capital, labor, materials and overhead. We compete for customers primarily on the basis of home design and location, price, customer satisfaction, construction quality, reputation, and the availability of mortgage financing. We also compete with resales of existing homes and rental properties. Decisions made by competitors to reduce home sales prices and/or increase the use of sales incentives (which may be easier to do for larger competitors with lower cost structures or necessary for distressed sellers) may require us to do the same to maintain our sales pace, which will harm our financial results.\nLabor and material shortages and price fluctuations could delay or increase the cost of home construction and reduce our sales and earnings.\nThe residential construction industry experiences serious labor and material shortages from time to time, including shortages in qualified tradespeople, and supplies of insulation, drywall, cement, steel and lumber. These labor and material shortages can be more severe during periods of strong demand for housing or during periods where the regions in which we operate experience natural disasters that have a significant impact on existing residential and commercial structures. The cost of material may also be adversely affected during periods of shortage or high inflation. The cost of labor may be adversely affected by shortages of qualified tradespeople such as carpenters, roofers, electricians and plumbers, changes in laws relating to union activity and changes in immigration laws and trends in labor migration. During the national recession, a large number of qualified tradespeople went out of business or otherwise exited our markets. The reduction in available tradespeople is currently exacerbating labor shortages as demand for new housing has increased. From time to time, we have experienced volatile price swings in the cost of labor and materials, including in particular the cost of lumber, cement, steel and drywall. Shortages and price increases could cause delays in and increase our costs of home construction, which in turn could harm our operating results and profitability.\nWe may be unable to obtain suitable bonding for the development of our communities.\nWe are often required to provide bonds to governmental authorities and others to ensure the completion of our projects. If we are unable to obtain the required surety or performance bonds for our projects, our business operations and revenues could be adversely affected. From time to time, when market conditions become unfavorable, surety providers become reluctant to issue new bonds and some providers request credit enhancements (such as cash deposits or letters of credit) in order to maintain existing bonds or to issue new bonds. If we are unable to obtain required bonds in the future, or are required to provide credit enhancements with respect to our current or future bonds, our liquidity could be negatively impacted.\nHigh cancellation rates may negatively impact our business.\nIn connection with the sale of a home we collect a deposit from the homebuyer that is a small percentage of the total purchase price. The deposit may, in certain circumstances, be fully or partially refundable to our homebuyer prior to closing, depending on, among other things, the laws of the state in which the home is located. If the prices for our homes in a given community decline, competitors increase sales incentives, interest rates increase, the availability of mortgage financing tightens or a buyer experiences a change in their personal finances, they may have an incentive to cancel their home purchase contracts with us, even where they might be entitled to no refund or only a partial refund of this deposit. Significant cancellations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOperational Risks\nOur longer-term land acquisition strategy poses significant risks.\nFrom time-to-time, we purchase land parcels with longer-term time horizons when we believe market conditions provide an opportunity to purchase this land at acceptable prices. We plan to continue to invest a substantial portion of our cash in land, including in larger land parcels with longer holding periods that will require significant development activities. This strategy is subject to a number of risks. It is difficult to accurately forecast development costs and sales prices the longer the time horizon for a project and, with a longer time horizon, there is a greater chance that unanticipated\ndevelopment cost increases, changes in general market conditions and other adverse unanticipated changes could negatively impact the profitability of a project. In addition, larger land parcels are generally undeveloped and typically do not have all (or sometimes any) of the governmental approvals necessary to develop and construct homes. If we are unable to obtain these approvals or obtain approvals that restrict our ability to use the land in ways we do not anticipate, the value of the parcel will be negatively impacted. In addition, the acquisition of land with a longer term development horizon historically has not been a significant focus of our business in many of our markets and may therefore be subject to greater execution risk.\nSevere weather, other natural conditions or disasters and climate change may disrupt or delay construction.\nSevere weather and other natural conditions or disasters, such as earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, floods, heavy or prolonged rain or snow, and wildfires can negatively affect our operations by requiring us to delay or halt construction or to perform potentially costly repairs to our projects under construction and to unsold homes. Some conditions, like the severe drought California has experienced over the last several years, may cause state and local governments to take restrictive actions, including placing moratoriums on the issuance of building permits or the connection of new water meters, which may effectively halt new construction. Finally, many scientists believe that the rising level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is leading to climate change and that climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of weather related disasters. If true, we may experience increasing negative weather related impacts to our operations in the future.\nWe are subject to product liability and warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business, which can be costly.\nAs a homebuilder, we are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business. These claims are common in the homebuilding industry and can be costly. While we maintain product liability insurance and generally seek to require our subcontractors and design professionals to indemnify us for some portion of the liabilities arising from their work, there can be no assurance that these insurance rights and indemnities will be collectable or adequate to cover any or all construction defect and warranty claims for which we may be liable. For example, contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce, we are often responsible for applicable self-insured retentions (particularly in markets where we include our subcontractors on our general liability insurance and as a result our ability to seek indemnity for insured claims is significantly limited or nonexistent), certain claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits, and one or more of our insurance carriers could become insolvent. Additionally, the coverage offered by and availability of product liability insurance for construction defects is limited and costly. There can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted, become more costly or even unavailable.\nIn addition, we conduct a material portion of our business in California, one of the most highly regulated and litigious jurisdictions in the United States, which imposes a ten year, strict liability tail on most construction liability claims. As a result, our potential losses and expenses due to litigation, new laws and regulations may be greater than our competitors who have smaller California operations.\nA major safety incident relating to our business could be costly in terms of potential liabilities and reputational damage.\nBuilding sites are inherently dangerous, and operating in the homebuilding industry poses certain inherent health and safety risks. Due to health and safety regulatory requirements and the number of projects we own, health and safety performance is critical to the success of all areas of our business. Any failure in health and safety performance may result in penalties for non-compliance with relevant regulatory requirements, and a failure that results in a major or significant health and safety incident or injury could expose us to liability that could be costly. Such a failure could generate significant negative publicity and have a corresponding impact on our reputation, our relationships with relevant regulatory agencies or governmental authorities, and our ability to attract customers, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe rely on subcontractors to construct our homes and, in many cases, to obtain, building materials. The failure of our subcontractors to properly construct our homes, or to obtain suitable building materials, may be costly.\nWe engage subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes, and in many cases, to obtain the necessary building materials. Despite our quality control efforts, we may discover that our subcontractors were engaging in improper construction practices or installing defective materials in our homes. When we discover these issues we repair the homes in accordance with our new home warranty standards and as required by law. The cost of satisfying our warranty and other legal obligations in these instances may be significant and we may be unable to recover the cost of repair from subcontractors, suppliers and insurers.\nOur mortgage subsidiary may become obligated to repurchase loans it has sold in the secondary mortgage market or may become subject to borrower lawsuits.\nWhile our mortgage subsidiary generally sells the loans it originates within a short period of time in the secondary mortgage market on a non-recourse basis, this sale is subject to an obligation that we repurchase the loan or make a \"make-whole\" payment if, among other things, the purchaser's underwriting guidelines are not met or there is fraud in connection with the loan. It is possible that our mortgage subsidiary will be required to fund make-whole payments and/or repurchase loans as the holders of defaulted loans scrutinize loan files to seek reasons to require us to do so. Further, future make-whole payments could have a higher severity than those previously experienced. In such cases our current reserves might prove to be inadequate and we would be required to use additional cash and take additional charges to reflect the higher level of repurchase and make-whole activity, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on the services of key employees and the loss of any substantial number of these individuals or an inability to hire additional personnel could adversely affect us.\nOur success is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain skilled employees, including personnel with significant management and leadership skills. Competition for the services of these individuals in many of our operating markets can be intense and has increased as market conditions have improved. If we are unable to attract and retain skilled employees, we may be unable to accomplish the objectives set forth in our business plan.\nWe may not be able to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions, which could harm our profitability and divert management resources.\nWe may from time to time acquire other homebuilders or related businesses. Successful acquisitions require us to correctly identify appropriate acquisition candidates and to integrate acquired operations and management with our own. Should we make an error in judgment when identifying an acquisition candidate, should the acquired operations not perform as anticipated, or should we fail to successfully integrate acquired operations and management, we will likely fail to realize the benefits we intended to derive from the acquisition and may suffer other adverse consequences. Acquisitions involve a number of other risks, including the diversion of the attention of our management and corporate staff from operating our existing business, potential charges to earnings in the event of any write-down or write-off of goodwill and other assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and exposure to the acquired company's pre-existing liabilities. We can give no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions.\nOur failure to maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could expose us to liability and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations; Information technology failures could harm the Company's business\nPrivacy, security, and compliance concerns have continued to increase as technology has evolved. As part of our normal business activities, we collect and store certain confidential information, including personal information of homebuyers/borrowers and information about employees, vendors and suppliers. This information is entitled to protection under a number of regulatory regimes. We may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business, particularly our mortgage and title businesses. Our failure to maintain the security of the data which we are required to protect, including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information, could result in business disruption, damage to our reputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs, and also result in deterioration in customers confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages, and thus could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our information technology systems are dependent upon global communications providers, Web browsers, telephone systems and other aspects of the Internet infrastructure that have experienced significant systems failures and electrical outages in the past. While we take measures to ensure our major systems have redundant capabilities, our systems are susceptible to outages from fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins, cyber attacks and similar events. Despite our implementation of network security measures, our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions resulting from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. The occurrence of any of these events could materially or even entirely disrupt or damage our information technology systems and hamper our internal operations, our ability to provide services to our customers and the ability of our customers to access our information technology systems. A material network breach in the security of our information technology systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets. As a result, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nNegative publicity could adversely affect our reputation and our business, financial results and stock price.\nUnfavorable media related to our industry, company, brand, personnel, operations, business performance, or prospects may impact our stock price and the performance of our business, regardless of its accuracy or inaccuracy. The speed at which negative publicity is disseminated has increased dramatically through the use of electronic communication, including social media outlets, websites, and blogs. Our success in maintaining and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to this rapidly changing media environment. Adverse publicity or negative commentary from any media outlets could damage our reputation and reduce the demand for our homes, which would adversely affect our business.\nRegulatory Risks\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation, which can increase costs and reduce profitability.\nOur homebuilding operations, including land development activities, are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation, including environmental, construction, employment and worker health and safety, zoning and land use regulation. This regulation affects all aspects of the homebuilding process and can substantially delay or increase the costs of homebuilding activities, even on land for which we already have approvals. During the development process, we must obtain the approval of numerous governmental authorities that regulate matters such as:\n\u00b7\npermitted land uses, levels of density and architectural designs;\n\u00b7\nthe level of energy efficiency our homes are required to achieve;\n\u00b7\nthe level of greenhouse emissions relating to our operations and the homes we build;\n\u00b7\nthe installation of utility services, such as water and waste disposal;\n\u00b7\nthe dedication of acreage for open space, parks, schools and other community services; and\n\u00b7\nthe preservation of habitat for endangered species and wetlands, storm water control and other environmental matters.\nThe approval process can be lengthy, can be opposed by consumer or environmental groups, and can cause significant delays or permanently halt the development process. Delays or a permanent halt in the development process can cause substantial increases to development costs or cause us to abandon the project and to sell the affected land at a potential loss, which in turn could harm our operating results.\nIn addition, new housing developments are often subject to various assessments or impact fees for schools, parks, streets, highways and other public improvements. The costs of these assessments are subject to substantial change and can cause increases in the effective prices of our homes, which in turn could reduce our sales and/or profitability.\nThere continues to be a variety of energy related legislation being considered for enactment around the world. For instance, for the last several years, the federal congress has considered an array of energy related initiatives, from carbon \"cap and trade\" to a federal energy efficiency building code that would increase energy efficiency requirements for new homes between 30 and 50 percent. And in California, where we derive a significant portion of our profits, current regulations, if not altered or delayed, will require new homebuilders like us to build \"net-zero\" energy homes by 2020. These potential and actual laws, rules and regulations, if enacted or enforced, all have the potential to increase the cost of home construction significantly, which in turn could reduce our sales and/or profitability.\nMuch of the new and proposed energy related regulation is a response to concerns about climate change. As climate change concerns grow, legislation and regulatory activity of this nature is expected to continue and become more onerous. Similarly, energy related initiatives will impact a wide variety of companies throughout the world and because our operations are heavily dependent on significant amounts of raw materials, such as lumber, steel, and concrete, these initiatives could have an indirect adverse effect on our operations and profitability to the extent the suppliers of our materials are burdened with expensive cap and trade and similar energy related regulations.\nOur mortgage operations are also subject to federal, state, and local regulation, including eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs and various consumer protection laws. Our title insurance agency operations are subject to state insurance and other laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these requirements can lead to administrative enforcement actions, fines and penalties, the loss of required licenses and other required approvals, claims for monetary damages or demands for loan repurchase from investors, and rescission or voiding of the loan by the consumer.\nIncreased regulation of the mortgage industry could harm our future sales and earnings.\nThe mortgage industry remains under intense scrutiny and continues to face increasing regulation at the federal, state and local level. Changes in regulation have negatively impacted the full spectrum of mortgage related activity. Potential changes to federal laws and regulations could have the effect of limiting the activities of the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the entities that provide liquidity to the secondary mortgage market, which could lead to increases in mortgage interest rates. At the same time, the Federal Housing Administration's rules regarding Borrower FICO scores, down payment standards, and limiting the amount of permitted seller concessions, lessen the number of buyers able to finance a new home. All of these regulatory activities reduce the number of potential buyers who qualify for the financing necessary to purchase our homes, which could harm our future sales and earnings.\nChanges to tax laws could make homeownership more expensive.\nCurrent tax laws generally permit significant expenses associated with owning a home, primarily mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes, to be deducted for the purpose of calculating an individual's federal, and in many cases, state, taxable income. If the federal or state governments were to change applicable tax law to eliminate or reduce these benefits for all or certain classes of taxpayers, the after-tax cost of owning a home could increase significantly. This could harm our future sales and earnings.\nStates, cities and counties in which we operate may adopt slow growth or no growth initiatives reducing our ability or increasing our costs to build in these areas, which could harm our future sales and earnings.\nSeveral states, cities and counties in which we operate have in the past approved, or approved for inclusion on their ballot, various \"slow growth\" or \"no growth\" initiatives and other ballot measures that could negatively impact the land we own as well as the availability of additional land and building opportunities within those localities. Approval of slow or no growth measures would increase the cost of land and reduce our ability to open new home communities and to build and sell homes in the affected markets and would create additional costs and administrative requirements, which in turn could harm our future sales and earnings.\nFinancing Risks\nWe may need additional funds, and if we are unable to obtain these funds, we may not be able to operate our business as planned.\nOur operations require significant amounts of cash. Our requirements for additional capital, whether to finance operations or to service or refinance our existing indebtedness, fluctuate as market conditions and our financial performance and operations change. We cannot assure you that we will maintain cash reserves and generate sufficient cash flow from operations in an amount to enable us to service our debt or to fund other liquidity needs or business opportunities. Additionally, while we have a $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility designed to provide us with an additional source of liquidity to meet short-term cash needs, our ability and capacity to borrow under the facility is limited by our ability to meet the covenants and borrowing conditions of the facility.\nThe availability of additional capital, whether from private capital sources (including banks) or the public capital markets, fluctuates as our financial condition and market conditions in general change. There may be times when the private capital sources and the public debt or equity markets lack sufficient liquidity or when our securities cannot be sold at attractive prices, in which case we would not be able to access capital from these sources. In addition, a weakening of our financial condition or deterioration in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary funds. Even if available, additional financing could be costly or have adverse consequences. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of stock, dilution to stockholders could result. If additional funds are raised through the incurrence of debt, we will incur increased debt servicing costs and may become subject to additional restrictive financial and other covenants. We can give no assurance as to the terms or availability of additional capital. If we are not successful in obtaining or refinancing capital when needed, it could adversely impact our ability to operate our business effectively, which could reduce our sales and earnings, and adversely impact our financial position.\nWe have substantial debt and may incur additional debt; leverage may impair our financial condition and restrict our operations and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our debt instruments.\nWe currently have a substantial amount of debt. As of December 31, 2016, the principal amount of our homebuilding senior and convertible senior notes outstanding was approximately $3,400.5 million, $230.0 million of which matures in 2017, $800.0 million of which matures in 2018, $567.5 million of which matures between 2019 and 2020 and\n$1,803.0 million of which matures between 2021 and 2032. In addition, the instruments governing our debt permit us to incur additional debt. Our existing debt and any additional debt we incur could:\n\u00b7\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our existing debt instruments;\n\u00b7\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund land acquisitions and construction and development activities, particularly when the availability of financing in the capital markets is limited;\n\u00b7\nrequire a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations for the payment of interest on our debt, reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund working capital, land acquisitions and land development, acquisitions of other homebuilders and related businesses and other general corporate requirements;\n\u00b7\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u00b7\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors.\nServicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and refinance our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash flow in the future. To some extent, this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund other liquidity needs. As a result, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on favorable terms, if at all. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our debt on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIn addition, our 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2032 (the \"Convertible Notes\") entitle holders to require us to repurchase their notes at a price of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, on August 1, 2017, 2022 or 2027, or in the event of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes). If we do not have sufficient funds to repurchase notes when we are required to do so, or if instruments governing debt we have incurred prohibit us from using cash or other assets for that purpose, we might be unable to meet our obligations. Our failure to repurchase the Convertible Notes at a time when their repurchase is required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the Convertible Notes indenture, or the fundamental change itself, could also lead to a default under our revolving credit facility or other debt securities we have issued or could cause borrowings we have incurred to become due. If the repayment of a substantial amount of indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace period, we might not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the notes.\nWe currently have significant amounts invested in unconsolidated joint ventures with independent third parties in which we have less than a controlling interest. These investments are highly illiquid and have significant risks.\nWe participate in unconsolidated homebuilding and land development joint ventures with independent third parties in which we have less than a controlling interest. At December 31, 2016, we had an aggregate of $127.1 million invested in these joint ventures, of which two joint ventures had project specific debt outstanding, which totaled $31.0 million. This joint venture debt is non-recourse to us.\nWhile these joint ventures provide us with a means of accessing larger and/or more desirable land parcels and lot positions, they are subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\nRestricted Payment Risk. Certain of our senior notes limit our ability to make investments in joint ventures. If we become unable to fund our joint venture obligations this could result in, among other things, defaults under our joint venture operating agreements, loan agreements, and credit enhancements. And, our failure to satisfy our joint venture obligations could also affect our joint venture's ability to carry out its operations or strategy which could impair the value of our investment in the joint venture.\n\u00b7\nEntitlement Risk. Certain of our joint ventures acquire parcels of unentitled raw land. If the joint venture is unable to timely obtain entitlements at a reasonable cost, project delay or even project termination may occur resulting in an impairment of the value of our investment.\n\u00b7\nDevelopment Risk. The projects we build through joint ventures are often larger and have a longer time horizon than the typical project developed by our wholly-owned homebuilding operations. Time delays associated with\nobtaining entitlements, unforeseen development issues, unanticipated labor and material cost increases, higher carrying costs, and general market deterioration and other changes are more likely to impact larger, long-term projects, all of which may negatively impact the profitability of these ventures and our proportionate share of income.\n\u00b7\nFinancing Risk. There are generally a limited number of sources willing to provide acquisition, development and construction financing to land development and homebuilding joint ventures. During difficult market conditions, it may be difficult or impossible for our joint ventures to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms, or for our joint ventures to refinance existing borrowings as such borrowings mature. As a result, we may be required to contribute our corporate funds to the joint venture to finance acquisition and development and/or construction costs following termination or step-down of joint venture financing that the joint venture is unable to restructure, extend, or refinance with another third party lender. In addition, our ability to contribute our funds to or for the joint venture may be limited as n discussed above.\n\u00b7\nContribution Risk. Under credit enhancements that we typically provide with respect to joint venture borrowings, we and our partners could be required to make additional unanticipated investments in these joint ventures, either in the form of capital contributions or loan repayments, to reduce such outstanding borrowings. We may have to make additional contributions that exceed our proportional share of capital if our partners fail to contribute any or all of their share. While in most instances we would be able to exercise remedies available under the applicable joint venture documentation if a partner fails to contribute its proportional share of capital, our partner's financial condition may preclude any meaningful cash recovery on the obligation.\n\u00b7\nCompletion Risk. We often sign a completion agreement in connection with obtaining financing for our joint ventures. Under such agreements, we may be compelled to complete a project even if we no longer have an economic interest in the property.\n\u00b7\nIlliquid Investment Risk. We lack a controlling interest in our joint ventures and therefore are generally unable to compel our joint ventures to sell assets, return invested capital, require additional capital contributions or take any other action without the vote of at least one or more of our venture partners. This means that, absent partner agreement, we may not be able to liquidate our joint venture investments to generate cash.\n\u00b7\nPartner Dispute. If we have a dispute with one of our joint venture partners and are unable to resolve it, a buy-sell provision in the applicable joint venture agreement could be triggered or we may otherwise pursue a negotiated settlement involving the unwinding of the venture and it is possible that litigation between us and our partner(s) could result. In such cases, we may sell our interest to our partner or purchase our partner's interest. If we sell our interest, we will forgo the profit we would have otherwise earned with respect to the joint venture project and may be required to forfeit our invested capital and/or pay our partner to release us from our joint venture obligations. If we are required to purchase our partner's interest, we would need to fund this purchase, as well as the completion of the project, with corporate level capital and to consolidate the joint venture project onto our balance sheet, which could, among other things, adversely impact our liquidity, our leverage and other financial conditions or covenants.\n\u00b7\nConsolidation Risk. The accounting rules for joint ventures are complex and the decision as to whether it is proper to consolidate a joint venture onto our balance sheet is fact intensive. If the facts concerning an unconsolidated joint venture were to change and a triggering event under applicable accounting rules were to occur, we might be required to consolidate previously unconsolidated joint ventures onto our balance sheet which could adversely impact our leverage and other financial conditions or covenants.\nAt times, such as now, when we are pursuing a longer-term land acquisition strategy, we become directly subject to some of these risks in varying degrees, including those discussed above related to entitlement, development, financing, completion and illiquid investment. Increasing our direct exposure to these types of risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results or operations.\nOther Risks\nOur principal stockholder has the ability to exercise significant influence over the composition of our Board of Directors and matters requiring stockholder approval.\nAs of December 31, 2016, MP CA Homes LLC held 37% of the voting power of our voting stock. Pursuant to the amended stockholders' agreement that we entered into with MP CA Homes LLC, effective October 1, 2015, MP CA Homes LLC is entitled to designate up to two directors to serve on our Board of Directors so long as they hold at least 20% of our\nvoting power and one director so long as they hold at least 10% of our voting power, giving MP CA Homes LLC the ability to exercise significant influence on the composition and actions of our Board of Directors. In addition, this large voting block may have a significant or decisive effect on the approval or disapproval of matters requiring approval of our stockholders, including any amendment to our certificate of incorporation, any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions. The interests of MP CA Homes LLC in these other matters may not always coincide with the interests of our other stockholders. In addition, the ownership of such a large block of our voting power and the right to designate directors by MP CA Homes LLC may discourage someone from making a significant equity investment in us, even if we needed the investment to operate our business, or could be a significant factor in delaying or preventing a change of control transaction that other stockholders may deem to be in their best interests.\nOur charter, bylaws, stockholders' rights agreement and debt covenants could prevent a third party from acquiring us or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock.\nProvisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of us. These provisions could delay or prevent a change in control of and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation also authorizes our Board of Directors to issue new series of common stock and preferred stock without stockholder approval. Depending on the rights and terms of any new series created, and the reaction of the market to the series, rights of existing stockholders could be negatively affected. For example, subject to applicable law, our Board of Directors could create a series of common stock or preferred stock with preferential rights to dividends or assets upon liquidation, or with superior voting rights to our existing common stock. The ability of our Board of Directors to issue these new series of common stock and preferred stock could also prevent or delay a third party from acquiring us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nWe are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits Delaware corporations from engaging in business combinations specified in the statute with an interested stockholder, as defined in the statute, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person first becomes an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in advance by a majority of the independent directors or by the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding disinterested shares. The application of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us.\nWe also have a stockholders' rights agreement that could make it difficult to acquire us without the approval of our Board of Directors. Our stockholders' rights agreement has been filed with and is publicly available at or from the SEC; see Part IV, Item 15.\nIn addition, some of our debt covenants contained in the indentures for our outstanding public notes and our revolving credit facility may delay or prevent a change in control. Our outstanding notes contain change of control provisions that give the holders of our outstanding notes the right to require us to purchase the notes upon a change in control triggering event at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, a change of control is an event of default under our revolving credit facility.", "PERMNO": 72696, "SIC": 1531, "TIC": "CAA"}
