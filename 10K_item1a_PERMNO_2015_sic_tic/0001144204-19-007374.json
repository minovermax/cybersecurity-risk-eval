RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in the Company\u2019s common stock involves a high degree of risk. Prospective investors should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included or referred to in this Form 10-K, before purchasing shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. There are numerous and varied risks that may prevent the Company from achieving its goals. If any of these risks actually occurs, the business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline and investors in the Company\u2019s common stock could lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business\nAs the Company has incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows since our inception, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern absent additional financing, which the Company may not be able to obtain on favorable terms or at all.\nThe Company has incurred net losses since inception in 2009 and the Company cannot be certain if or when the Company will produce sufficient revenue from our operations to support our costs. The Company had a net loss of $7,767,407 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and a net loss of $5,305,169 for the year ended December 31, 2017 leading to an accumulated deficit of $34,633,363 and $26,865,956 as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The Company has utilized cash in operating activities of $4,173,831 during the year ended December 31, 2018 and $3,403,696 during the year ended December 31, 2017, The Company expects to continue to incur net losses and negative operating cash flows in the near-term.\nThe Company will continue to incur significant expenses for commercialization activities related to its lead product Lumega-Z, the MapcatSF medical device, the CSV-1000 and ESV-3000 devices, and with respect to efforts to build its infrastructure and expand its operations. The Company is contemplating a public offering of shares of its common stock and has applied to list its common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cGHSI\u201d (the \u201cPublic Offering\u201d). The Company believes that the net proceeds from the Company\u2019s contemplated Public Offering, together with its existing cash and cash equivalents will allow it to fund its operating plan through at least the next twelve months. The Company has based these estimates, however, on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and the Company could spend its available financial resources much faster than it currently expects and may need to raise additional funds sooner than it anticipates. There can be no assurances that the Company will complete the Public Offering.\nEven if profitability is achieved in the future, the Company may not be able to sustain profitability on a consistent basis. The Company expects to continue to incur substantial losses and negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future. The Company\u2019s financial statements included in this Annual Report have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company\u2019s auditors have made reference to the substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern in their audit report on its audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. Because the Company has been issued an opinion by its auditors that substantial doubt exists as to whether the Company can continue as a going concern, it may be more difficult for the Company to attract investors. The Company\u2019s future is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations.\nThe Company does not have any credit facilities as a source of future funds, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all. The Company may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings and debt financings. If the Company raises additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted, and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. Debt financing, if obtained, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting the ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, could increase expenses and require that assets secure such debt. Moreover, any debt the Company incur must be repaid regardless of our operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing will be subject to a number of factors, including market conditions, operating performance and investor sentiment. If the Company are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, the Company may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue our operations or obtain funds by entering into agreements on unattractive terms, which would likely have a material adverse effect on its business, stock price and relationships with third parties, at least until additional funding is obtained. If the Company does not have sufficient funds to continue operations, the Company could be required to seek other alternatives that would likely result in our stockholders losing some or all of their investment.\nThe Company\u2019s future success is largely dependent on the successful commercialization of Lumega-Z\u00ae, the MapcatSF\u00ae medical device, the CSV-1000 and ESV-3000 testing devices, and the successful integration of VectorVision into the Company\u2019s business.\nThe future success of the Company\u2019s business is largely dependent upon the successful commercialization of its medical food, Lumega-Z, and its medical device, the MapcatSF and the VectorVision CSV-1000 and ESV-3000 testing devices. The Company is dedicating a substantial amount of its resources to advance Lumega-Z and certain resources to advance MapcatSF as aggressively as possible. If the Company encounters difficulties in the commercialization of Lumega-Z or the MapcatSF, the Company will not have the resources necessary to continue its business in its current form. If the Company is unable to establish and maintain adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into or maintain agreements with third parties to do so, it may be unable to successfully commercialize its products. The Company believes it is creating an efficient commercial organization, taking advantage of outsourcing options where prudent to maximize the effectiveness of its commercial expenditures. However, it may not be able to correctly judge the size and experience of the sales and marketing force and the scale of distribution necessary to be successful. Establishing and maintaining sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities are expensive and time-consuming. Such expenses may be disproportionate compared to the revenues the Company may be able to generate on sales of Lumega-Z or licensing fees or sales of the MapcatSF device or the CSV-1000 and ESV-3000 testing devices. If this occurs, it will have an adverse impact on operations and the Company\u2019s ability to fund any future development.\nThe Company may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the VectorVision acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. The Company may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating VectorVision into the existing business and VectorVision may underperform relative to the Company\u2019s expectations.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the VectorVision acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on its ability to integrate the business of VectorVision with its legacy business, which may be a complex, costly and time-consuming process. The Company may be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrate the VectorVision business practices into its existing operations. The integration process may disrupt its business and, if implemented ineffectively, could restrict the realization of the full expected benefits of the acquisition. The failure to meet the challenges involved in the integration process and to realize the anticipated benefits of the VectorVision acquisition could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the Company\u2019s operations and could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the integration of VectorVision may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customers and other business relationships, and diversion of management\u2019s attention. Additional integration challenges may include, among other things:\n\u2022 difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects;\n\u2022 difficulties in the integration of operations and systems;\n\u2022 difficulties in conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies, business cultures and compensation structures;\n\u2022 difficulties in the assimilation of employees;\n\u2022 difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a larger and more complex company; and\n\u2022 the impact of potential liabilities the Company may be assuming from VectorVision.\nThe Company has limited experience in developing medical foods and medical devices, and it may be unable to commercialize some of the products and services it develops.\nDevelopment and commercialization of medical foods and medical devices involves a lengthy and complex process. The Company has limited experience in developing products and has only one commercialized medical food product on the market, Lumega-Z. In addition, no one has ever developed or commercialized a medical device like the MapcatSF. The Company cannot assure you that it is possible to further develop or successfully commercialize the MapcatSF or that it will be successful in doing so. While the CSV-1000 and ESV-3000 visual acuity testing devices are commercialized, there is no guarantee that they will continue to be marketable or enjoy commercial success.\nEven if the Company develops products for commercial use, these products may not be accepted by the medical and pharmaceutical marketplaces or be capable of being offered at prices that will enable the Company to become profitable. The Company cannot assure you that its products will be approved by regulatory authorities, if required, or ultimately prove to be useful for commercial markets, meet applicable regulatory standards, or be successfully marketed.\nThe Company\u2019s ongoing investment in new businesses and new products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and could disrupt its current operations.\nThe Company has invested and expects to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies. The expansion into the transcranial doppler testing business is a reflection of its ongoing efforts to innovate and provide useful products and services. Such endeavors involve significant risks and uncertainties, including insufficient revenues from such investments to offset any new liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments, inadequate return of capital on the Company\u2019s investments, distraction of management from current operations, and unidentified issues not discovered in its due diligence of such strategies and offerings that could cause the Company to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such investments and incur unanticipated liabilities. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nThe Company and its suppliers and manufacturers are subject to a number of existing laws, regulations and industry initiatives and the regulatory environment of the healthcare industry is continuing to change. If it is determined that the Company or its suppliers or manufacturers are not in compliance with the laws and regulations to which they are respectively subject, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nAs a participant in the healthcare industry, the Company\u2019s operations and relationships, and those of the Company\u2019s customers, are regulated by a number of federal, state, local, and foreign governmental entities, and the Company\u2019s products must be capable of being used by its customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations. Because of its business relationships with physicians and professional healthcare providers, and since its product, Lumega-Z is believed to be a medical food and the MapcatSF and the CSV-1000 and ESV-3000 are medical devices, a number of regulations are implicated. For example, from the FDA\u2019s perspective, a drug cures, treats, or mitigates the effects or symptoms of a specific disease. A medical food manages a specific disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation. While the Company believes Lumega-Z is a medical food, if the FDA determines Lumega-Z to be a drug, the Company and the product would be subject to considerable additional FDA regulation. Similarly, while the Company believes the MapcatSF is a safe medical device, with a very low potential risk of injury to a patient, the Company believes the MapcatSF is correctly classified as a Class I medical device, which does not require any premarket approval. The CSV-1000 and ESV-3000 are currently classified with the FDA as Class I medical devices. If, however, the FDA were to determine that the MapcatSF, the CSV-1000 or ESV-3000 is a Class II medical device, the Company and the particular product or products would be subject to considerable additional regulatory requirements.\nIn addition, the Company cannot anticipate how changes in regulations or determinations by regulatory agencies may evolve. Thus, application of many foreign, state and federal regulations to the Company\u2019s business operations is uncertain. Further, there are federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including anti-kickback laws and limitations on physician referrals and laws related to off-label promotion of prescription drugs that may or may not be directly or indirectly applicable to the Company\u2019s operations and relationships or the business practices of its customers. It is possible that a review of its business practices or those of its customers by courts or regulatory authorities could result in a determination that may adversely affect the Company. In addition, the healthcare regulatory environment may change in a way that restricts existing operations or growth. The healthcare industry is expected to continue to undergo significant changes for the foreseeable future, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company cannot predict the effect of possible future legislation and regulation.\nThe Company may be subject to fines, penalties, injunctions and other sanctions if it is deemed to be promoting the use of its products as a drug.\nThe Company\u2019s business and future growth depend on the development, use and ultimate sale of products that are subject to FDA regulation, clearance and approval. Under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other laws, the Company is prohibited from promoting its products for treatment of a condition or disease. This means that the Company may not make claims about the usefulness or effectiveness or expected outcome of use of its products for any particular condition or disease and may not proactively discuss or provide information on the use of its products, except as allowed by the FDA.\nThere is a risk that the FDA or other federal or state law enforcement authorities could determine that the nature and scope of our sales and marketing activities may constitute the promotion of our products for use as a drug in violation of applicable law. The Company also faces the risk that the FDA or other regulatory authorities might pursue enforcement based on past activities that the Company discontinued or changed, including sales activities, arrangements with institutions and doctors, educational and training programs and other activities.\nGovernment investigations are typically expensive, disruptive, burdensome and generate negative publicity. If its promotional activities are found to be in violation of applicable law or if the Company agrees to a settlement in connection with an enforcement action, the Company would likely face significant fines and penalties and would likely be required to substantially change its sales, promotion and educational activities. In addition, were any enforcement actions against the Company or its senior officers to arise, the Company could be excluded from participation in U.S. government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\nLumega-Z may not qualify as a medical food as defined by the FDA.\nIf the FDA makes a determination that Lumega-Z should not be defined as a medical food (and does not qualify as a drug), the Company would need to relabel and rebrand that product. While reclassification and the subsequent relabeling and rebranding would be an added cost to operations, it would not change the use or effectiveness of Lumega-Z. Although, management believes it is unlikely the FDA would make such a determination, there is a chance that certain physicians may choose not to recommend Lumega-Z to their patients or that certain consumers may choose not to buy Lumega-Z if it is not classified as a medical food. While there is no insurance coverage for Lumega-Z as a medical food, if insurance companies would otherwise pay for Lumega-Z because of it being a medical food, a determination by the FDA that Lumega-Z should not be defined as a medical food could limit or eliminate such potential insurance coverage which might adversely impact the sales of Lumega-Z.\nThe Company\u2019s products may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent any required regulatory approval, limit the commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences following any potential marketing approval.\nIf the Company\u2019s products, including Lumega-Z, are associated with undesirable side effects or have characteristics that are unexpected, the Company may need to abandon its development or limit development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Any serious adverse or undesirable side effects identified during the development of its products, could interrupt, delay or halt commercialization and/or could result in the additional regulatory requirements by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, and in turn prevent the Company from commercializing its product candidates and generating revenues from their sale.\nA key part of the Company\u2019s business strategy is to establish collaborative relationships to commercialize and develop its product candidates. The Company may not succeed in establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships, which may significantly limit its ability to develop and commercialize its products successfully, if at all.\nA key part of the Company\u2019s business strategy is to establish collaborative relationships to commercialize and fund development of its product candidates. The Company is currently a party to several collaborative relationships. The Illinois College of Optometry, for example, has included the MapcatSF prototype in its curriculum to instruct students on how to measure the macular pigment. The New York Eye and Ear Infirmary is currently evaluating Lumega-Z on glaucoma patients. The Rosenberg School of Optometry at the University of the Immaculate Word is conducting research on patients with a MapcatSF prototype. Moreover, the Company\u2019s Science Advisory Board, each member of whom is displayed on the Company website, includes world renowned experts in macular carotenoids who are developing the peer review markets by conducting research and furthering the understanding of the relevance of the macular pigment in ocular health. The Company\u2019s Medical Advisors includes thought-leading clinicians in retina, glaucoma and the anterior segment of the eye, providing guidance on understanding the clinical applications of Lumega-Z and the MapcatSF and understanding the market opportunities and assisting in driving our strategic goals. However, there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in negotiating similar collaborative relationships with regard to the CSV-1000 and ESV-3000.\nWhile the Company believes that these collaborative relationships help further validate the MapcatSF and Lumega-Z, these relationships are not material to the Company because none of these relationships is exclusive, there are many potential collaborative partners available, and the Company is free to enter into other collaborative relationships as needed. No sales of Lumega-Z are generated directly from Illinois College of Optometry because the MapcatSF is part of its teaching curriculum, not used for direct patient care. However, the other collaborative partners, as a result of using the MapcatSF on patients, periodically put patients on Lumega-Z if a physician determines it appropriate to do so. The majority of sales of Lumega-Z primarily come from clinicians outside of these collaborative relationships.\nThe Company may not be able to negotiate collaborations on acceptable terms, if at all, and if it does enter into collaborations, these collaborations may not be successful. The Company\u2019s current and future success depends in part on its ability to enter into successful collaboration arrangements. If the Company is unable to establish and maintain collaborative relationships on acceptable terms or to successfully transition terminated collaborative agreements, the Company may have to delay or discontinue further development of one or more of its product candidates, undertake development and commercialization activities at its own expense or find alternative sources of capital. Consequently, if it is unable to enter into, maintain or extend successful collaborations, the Company\u2019s business may be harmed.\nThe Company\u2019s long-term success may depend upon the successful development and commercialization of products other than Lumega-Z, the MapcatSF medical device and the CSV-1000 and ESV-3000 testing devices.\nThe Company\u2019s long-term viability and growth may depend upon the successful development and commercialization of products other than Lumega-Z and the MapcatSF. Product development and commercialization is very expensive and involves a high degree of risk. Only a small number of research and development programs result in the commercialization of a product. Product development is a complex and time-consuming process. If the Company fails to adequately manage the research, development, execution and regulatory aspects of new product development it may fail to launch new products altogether.\nGovernment agencies may establish usage guidelines that directly apply to the Company\u2019s products or proposed products or change legislation or regulations to which the Company is subject.\nGovernment usage guidelines typically address matters such as usage and dose, among other factors. Application of these guidelines could limit the use of the Company\u2019s products and products that the Company may develop. In addition, there can be no assurance that government regulations applicable to the Company\u2019s products or proposed products or the interpretation thereof will not change and thereby prevent the marketing of some or all of its products for a period of time or permanently. The FDA\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could modify, prevent, delay or change the regulatory approval required of the Company\u2019s products. The Company cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the U.S. or in other countries.\nPatent litigation is common in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries. Any litigation or claim against the Company may cause it to incur substantial costs and could place a significant strain on its financial resources, divert the attention of management from its business and harm the Company\u2019s reputation.\nWhile the Company is not a pharmaceutical or a biopharmaceutical company, as a health sciences company, the Company\u2019s medical foods or its medical devices may come into competition with products in the medical foods and related industries, such as pharmaceuticals, biologics or dietary supplements. There has been substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries with respect to the manufacture, use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights. For the most part, these lawsuits relate to the validity, enforceability and infringement of patents. The Company expects it will rely upon patents, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain its competitive position. The Company may find it necessary to initiate claims to defend its intellectual property rights as a result. Other parties may have issued patents or be issued patents that may prevent the sale of the Company\u2019s products or know-how or require the Company to license such patents and pay significant fees or royalties to produce its products. In addition, future patents may issue to third parties which the Company\u2019s technology may infringe. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be applications now pending of which the Company is unaware that may later result in issued patents that the Company\u2019s products may infringe.\nIntellectual property litigation, regardless of outcome, is expensive and time-consuming, and could divert management\u2019s attention from our business and have a material negative effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. If such a dispute were to be resolved against us, the Company may be required to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorney\u2019s fees to the party claiming infringement if the Company were to be found to have willfully infringed a third party\u2019s patent. The Company may also have to develop non-infringing technology, stop selling any products it develops, cease using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property or enter into royalty or license agreements that may not be available on acceptable or commercially practical terms, if at all. The Company\u2019s failure to develop non-infringing technologies or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis could harm its business. Modification of any products the Company develops or development of new products thereafter could require the Company to become subject to other requirements of the FDA and other regulatory bodies, which could be time-consuming and expensive. In addition, parties making infringement claims may be able to obtain an injunction that would prevent the Company from selling any products it develops, which could harm its business.\nThe Company\u2019s competitors may develop products similar to Lumega-Z, and the Company may therefore need to modify or alter its business strategy, which may delay the achievement of its goals.\nCompetitors may develop products with similar characteristics to Lumega-Z. Such similar products marketed by larger competitors could hinder the Company\u2019s efforts to penetrate the market. As a result, the Company may be forced to modify or alter its business and regulatory strategy and sales and marketing plans, as a response to changes in the market, competition and technology limitations, among others. Such modifications may pose additional delays in achieving the Company\u2019s goals.\nThe Company\u2019s competitors may develop products similar to the MapcatSF medical device, and the Company may therefore need to modify or alter its business strategy, which may delay the achievement of its goals.\nWhile the Company believes the MapcatSF is the only device available that can accurately measure the density of the macular pigment, competitors may develop products with similar characteristics to the Company\u2019s MapcatSF medical device. Such similar products marketed by larger competitors could hinder the Company\u2019s efforts to develop the market. As a result, the Company may be forced to modify or alter its business and regulatory strategy and sales and marketing plans, as a response to changes in the market, competition and technology limitations, among others. Such modifications may pose additional delays in achieving the Company\u2019s goals.\nThe Company\u2019s competitors may develop products similar to the CSV-1000 and ESV-3000 devices, and the Company may therefore need to modify or alter its business strategy, which may delay the achievement of its goals.\nWhile the Company believes that VectorVision is the only company that offers fully standardized vision testing products that ensure consistent, repeatable and highly accurate results, its competitors may introduce similar products that may compete with the CSV-1000 and ESV-3000 devices. These devices offer auto-calibrated tests to ensure the correct testing luminance and contrast levels for consistent, highly accurate and repeatable results, which is why the VectorVision instruments can detect and quantify subtle changes in vision, and why the VectorVision CSV-1000 instrument is used by eye doctors in more than 60 countries to accomplish contrast sensitivity testing. For the same reasons, the Company believes that the ESV-3000 ETDRS testing device will become the worldwide standard for ETDRS visual acuity testing. The Company\u2019s research has revealed no competing products that offers auto-calibration of ambient illumination. Competitive devices do not allow for variations in ambient light levels, resulting in variability of test results due to the environment in which the testing is performed. The CSV-1000 and ESV-3000 use self-calibrated test lighting. The self-calibrated test lighting is proprietary, and the test faces of the CSV-1000 are proprietary and the intellectual property is protected under copyright and trade secret law. Both CSV-1000 and ESV-3000 are currently sold worldwide, and the Company expects this global distribution to continue. There is a training requirement in incorporating the CSV-1000 device into clinical practice, which the Company plans to provide as part of its commercialization strategy. Competitors currently exist, and while the Company believes its market penetration and intellectual property protection are barriers to entry, competitors may invent around the Company\u2019s intellectual property or otherwise overcome barriers to entry and introduce similar products to compete with either the CSV-1000 or ESV-3000.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to compete successfully could cause its revenue or market share to decline.\nThe market for our products and services is competitive and is characterized by rapidly evolving industry standards, technology and user needs and the frequent introduction of new products and services. Some of our competitors, which include major pharmaceutical companies with alternatives to our products, may be more established, benefit from greater name recognition and have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than us. We compete on the basis of several factors, including distribution of products, reputation, scientific validity, reliability, client service, price, and industry expertise and experience. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that the competitive pressures that we face will not materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the Company is unable to develop its own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, or if it is not successful in contracting with third parties for these services on favorable terms, or at all, revenues from products could be limited.\nThe Company currently has limited sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. To commercialize our products successfully, we have to develop more robust capabilities internally or collaborate with third parties that can perform these services for us. In the process of commercializing our products, we may not be able to hire the necessary experienced personnel and build sales, marketing and distribution operations capable of successfully launching new products and generating sufficient product revenues. In addition, establishing such operations takes time and involves significant expense.\nIf the Company decides to enter into co-promotion or other licensing arrangements with third parties, we may be unable to identify acceptable partners because the number of potential partners is limited and because of competition from others for similar alliances with potential partners. Even if we are able to identify one or more acceptable partners, we may not be able to enter into any partnering arrangements on favorable terms, or at all. If we enter into any partnering arrangements, our revenues are likely to be lower than if we marketed and sold our products ourselves.\nIn addition, any revenues the Company receives would depend upon our partners\u2019 efforts which may not be adequate due to lack of attention or resource commitments, management turnover, and change of strategic focus, further business combinations or other factors outside of our control. Depending upon the terms of our agreements, the remedies we have against an under-performing partner may be limited. If we were to terminate the relationship, it may be difficult or impossible to find a replacement partner on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIf the Company cannot compete successfully for market share against other companies, it may not achieve sufficient product revenues and its business will suffer.\nThe market for our products and product candidates is characterized by competition and technological advances. If our products are unable to capture and maintain market share, we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer.\nWe will compete for market share against fully integrated medical food and medical device companies or other companies that develop products independently or collaborate with larger pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. In addition, many of these competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, have substantially greater capital resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities, and greater financial resources than we do, as well as significantly greater experience in:\n\u00b7 developing medical foods and medical devices;\n\u00b7 conducting product testing and studies;\n\u00b7 complying with regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7 formulating and manufacturing products; and\n\u00b7 launching, marketing, distributing and selling products.\nOur competitors may:\n\u00b7 develop and patent processes or products earlier than we will;\n\u00b7 develop and commercialize products that are less expensive or more efficient than our products;\n\u00b7 comply with regulatory requirements more rapidly than us; or\n\u00b7 improve upon existing technological approaches or develop new or different approaches that render our technology or products obsolete or uncompetitive.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully against current or future competitors, we may be unable to obtain market acceptance for any product candidates that we create, which could prevent us from generating revenues or achieving profitability and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nProduct liability lawsuits against the Company could divert its resources and could cause it to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of Company products.\nWe face a risk of product liability exposure related to the use of our products, including Lumega-Z. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7 decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we develop;\n\u00b7 injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u00b7 significant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u00b7 loss of revenue; and\n\u00b7 reduced time and attention of our management to pursue our business strategy.\nOur insurance policies may not fully cover liabilities that we may incur in the event of a product liability lawsuit. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nThe Company may be unsuccessful in expanding its product distribution outside the United States.\nTo the extent we begin to offer our products outside the United States, we expect that we may be dependent on third-party distribution relationships. Distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell our products to the level of our expectations. If distributors do not perform adequately, or we are unable to locate distributors in particular geographic areas, our ability to realize long-term international revenue growth would be materially adversely affected.\nAdditionally, our products may require regulatory clearances and approvals from jurisdictions outside the United States. We expect that we will be subject to and required to comply with local regulatory requirements before selling our products in those jurisdictions. We are not certain that we will be able to obtain these clearances or approvals or compliance requirements on a timely basis, or at all.\nManufacturing risks and inefficiencies may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to produce products.\nWe engage third parties to manufacture our products in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis, while maintaining product quality, acceptable manufacturing costs and complying with regulatory requirements. In determining the required quantities of our products and the manufacturing schedule, we must make significant judgments and estimates based on historical experience, inventory levels, current market trends and other related factors. Because of the inherent nature of estimates, there could be significant differences between our estimates and the actual amounts of products we require. If we are unable to obtain from one or more of our vendors the needed materials or components that meet our specifications on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we may not be able to meet the demand for our products. While we have not arranged for alternate suppliers, and it may be difficult to find alternate suppliers in a timely manner and on terms acceptable to us, we believe that there are multiple alternative sources, suppliers and manufacturers available for our products and devices in the event of a termination or a disagreement with any current vendor.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise the Company\u2019s information and expose it to liability, which would cause its business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers and business partners, including personally identifiable information of our customers, some of which is stored on our network and some of which is stored with our third-party E-commerce vendor. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our network and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe Company\u2019s products and facility and the facilities of its manufacturers are subject to federal laws and regulations and certain requirements in the State of California. Failure to comply with any law or regulation could result in penalties and restrictions on the Company\u2019s manufacturers\u2019 ability to manufacture and the Company\u2019s ability to distribute products. If any such action were to be imposed, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nAlthough medical foods do not require pre-market approval by the FDA, manufacturers of medical foods must be registered with the FDA under a provision promulgated by the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (the \u201cBioterrorism Act\u201d). Manufacturers of medical foods are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA. The manufacture of our medical foods is outsourced in its entirety to a third-party manufacturer. We are evaluating additional manufacturers for selection as second source or back-up providers. Our medical foods have not been reviewed by the FDA. There is no certainty that the FDA will favorably review our medical food products or our manufacturers\u2019 facilities. If the outcome of an inspection is negative or if we or our manufacturers fail to comply with any law or regulation, we could be subject to penalties and restrictions on our manufacturers\u2019 ability to manufacture and distribute products. Any such action may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. For a more complete discussion of the laws and regulations to which we are subject, see the section of this Annual Report titled \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation.\u201d\nPrior to the acquisition of VectorVision, all of the Company\u2019s billings and revenues have been derived from the sale of a single product.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018 as well as the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company derived a portion of its revenues from the sale of Lumega-Z\u00ae. While we continue to see an increasing demand for Lumega-Z from our customers, we cannot assure you that the demand will continue. A decline in sales of Lumega-Z to our customers may have an immediate adverse effect on our financial results. The Company expects to continue to realize revenues from sales of the CSV-1000 and ESV-3000 products, however, there is no assurance that such sales will continue at historical levels or that any of our products will otherwise continue to be commercially viable.\nThe Company\u2019s billings and revenues are derived from a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or more of them may have an immediate adverse effect on its financial results.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company\u2019s billings were derived from a limited number of individual customers and distributors. Customers may stop purchasing our products with little or no warning. Loss of customers may have an immediate adverse effect on our financial results.\nIf the Company is forced to reduce its prices, its business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nThe Company may be subject to pricing pressures with respect to its future sales arising from various sources, including practices of health insurance companies, healthcare providers and competition in the marketplace. If the Company\u2019s pricing experiences significant downward pressure, our business could be less profitable and our results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, because cash from sales funds our working capital requirements, reduced profitability could require us to raise additional capital to support our operations.\nIf the Company is unable to successfully introduce new products or fails to keep pace with medical advances and developments, its business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe successful implementation of our business model depends on our ability to adapt to evolving technologies and industry standards and introduce new products and services. We cannot assure you that we will be able to introduce new products on schedule, or at all, or that such products will achieve market acceptance. Moreover, competitors may develop competitive products that could adversely affect our results of operations. A failure by us to introduce planned products or other new products or to introduce these products on schedule may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we cannot adapt to changing technologies, our products and services may become obsolete, and our business could suffer. Because the healthcare industry is characterized by rapid technological change, we may be unable to anticipate changes in our current and potential customers\u2019 requirements that could make our existing technology obsolete. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products, develop new technology that addresses the needs of our prospective customers, license leading technologies and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost-effective basis. The development of our proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks. We may not be successful in using new technologies effectively or adapting our proprietary technology to evolving customer requirements or emerging industry standards, and, as a result, our business may suffer.\nIf customers do not accept the Company\u2019s products, or delay in deciding whether to recommend the Company\u2019s products and services, its business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur business model depends on our ability to sell our products. Acceptance of our products requires physicians to use our MapcatSF to measure the macular protective pigment in their patients\u2019 eyes, understand and appreciate the benefits of Lumega-Z in order to recommend it to their patients, and to understand the benefits of visual acuity testing using the CSV-1000 and ESV-3000 devices. We cannot assure you that physicians will integrate our products into their treatment plans or patient recommendations. Achieving market acceptance for our products and services will require substantial sales and marketing efforts and the expenditure of significant financial and other resources to create awareness and demand by participants in the healthcare industry. If we fail to achieve broad acceptance of our products by physicians, and other healthcare industry participants or if we fail to position our products as an ocular health remedy, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf the Company\u2019s principal suppliers fail or are unable to perform their contracts with the Company, it may be unable to meet its commitments to its customers. As a result, the Company\u2019s reputation and its relationships with its customers may be damaged and its business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe currently purchase all our medical food ingredients and products from three vendors - one for carotenoids, one for Omega 3, and one for all other supplements. These companies are subject to FDA regulation and they are responsible for compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d as defined by the FDA). Although our agreements provide that our suppliers will abide by the FDA manufacturing requirements, we cannot control their compliance. If they fail to comply with FDA manufacturing requirements, the FDA could prevent our vendors from manufacturing our ingredients and products. Although we believe that there are a number of other sources of supply of ingredients and manufacturers of medical food products, if these suppliers are unable to perform under our agreements, particularly at certain critical times such as when we add new physician clients that will require a large production of one or more products, we may be unable to meet our commitments to our customers. If this were to happen, our reputation as well as our relationships with our customers may suffer and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. We are evaluating several additional manufacturers for selection as second source or back-up providers.\nIf the Company incurs costs exceeding its insurance coverage in lawsuits that are brought against it in the future, such incident may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we were to become a defendant in any lawsuits involving the manufacture and sale of our products and if our insurance coverage were inadequate to satisfy these liabilities, it would be expected to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the Company is deemed to infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties, it could incur unanticipated expense and be prevented from providing its products and services.\nWe could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of our competitors grows and if our products or the functionality of our products overlap with patents of our competitors. While we do not believe that we have infringed or are infringing on any proprietary rights of third parties, we cannot assure you that infringement claims will not be asserted against us or that those claims will be unsuccessful. We could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources defending any infringement claims whether or not such claims are ultimately successful. Furthermore, a party making a claim against us could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to provide products or services. In addition, we cannot assure you that licenses for any intellectual property of third parties that might be required for our products or services will be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on its intellectual property rights, and if it is unable to protect them, its competitive position may suffer.\nOur business plan is predicated on our proprietary technology. Accordingly, protecting our intellectual property rights is critical to our continued success and our ability to maintain our competitive position. Our goal is to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law, confidentiality agreements and technical measures. We generally enter into non-disclosure agreements with our employees and consultants and limit access to our trade secrets and technology. We cannot assure you that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology. Misappropriation of our intellectual property would have an adverse effect on our competitive position.\nThe Company has four issued patents and five pending patent applications related to its products. There currently are no issued patents relating to Lumega-Z. Our success, competitive position, and future revenues will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products, methods, processes, and other technologies; to preserve our trade secrets; to obtain trademarks for our name, logo and products; to prevent third parties from infringing our proprietary rights; and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. To counter infringement or unauthorized use by third parties, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming.\nThe patent process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting our products by obtaining and defending patents. These risks and uncertainties include the following:\n\u00b7 Claims of issued patents, and the claims of any patents which may be issued in the future and be owned by or licensed to the Company may be challenged by third parties, resulting in patents being deemed invalid, unenforceable, or narrowed in scope, a third party may circumvent any such issued patents, or such issued patents may not provide any significant commercial protection against competing products;\n\u00b7 Our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than we do and many of which have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek, or may already have obtained, patents that will limit, interfere with, or eliminate our ability to make, use, and sell our potential products either in the United States or in international markets; and\n\u00b7 The legal systems of some foreign countries do not encourage the aggressive enforcement of patents, and countries other than the United States may have less restrictive patent laws than those upheld by United States courts, allowing foreign competitors the ability to exploit these laws to create, develop, and market competing products. Thus, the Company\u2019s foreign patents may not be enforceable to the same extent as the counterpart U.S. patents.\nIn addition, the USPTO, and patent offices in other jurisdictions have often required that patent applications concerning pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology-related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application, thereby limiting the scope of protection against competitive challenges. Thus, even if we or any of our licensors are able to obtain patents, the patents may be substantially narrower than anticipated.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends in part on and will continue to depend in part on its ability to establish and maintain additional strategic collaborative relationships. Failure to establish and maintain these relationships could make it more difficult to expand the reach of the Company\u2019s products, which may have a material adverse effect on its business.\nTo be successful, we must continue to maintain our existing strategic relationships, such as our relationship with our vendors who manufacture our medical food products. We also must continue to establish additional strategic relationships with healthcare leaders. This is critical to our success because we believe that these relationships contribute towards our ability to extend the reach of our products and services to a larger number of physicians, professional healthcare providers and physician groups and to other participants in the healthcare industry; develop and deploy new products and services; and generate additional revenue and cash flows. Entering into strategic relationships is complicated because strategic partners may decide to compete with us in some or all of our markets. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or establish relationships with key participants in the healthcare industry if we conduct business with their competitors.\nThe Company must attract quality management in order to manage its growth. Failure to do so may result in slower expansion.\nIn order to support the growth of our business and the additional obligations that come with being an exchange-listed company, we will need to expand our senior management team. We plan to recruit additional personnel, including a Chief Financial Officer and a Chief Operating Officer in the near future. There is no assurance that we will be capable of attracting and retaining quality executives and integrating those individuals into our management system. Without experienced and talented management, the growth of our business may be adversely impacted.\nCompetition for qualified employees is intense. The Company may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees needed to support its business. Without skilled employees, the quality of its product development and services could diminish and the growth of its business may be slowed, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to provide high-quality products and services to our clients depends, in large part, upon our employees\u2019 experience and expertise. We must attract and retain highly qualified personnel with a deep understanding of the pharmaceutical and healthcare information technology industries. In addition, we will invest significant time and expense in training our employees, increasing their value to clients as well as to competitors who may seek to recruit them, which will increase the cost of replacing them. If we fail to retain our employees, the quality of our product development and services could diminish and the growth of our business may be slowed. This may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the Company loses the services of its Chief Executive Officer and other key personnel, it may be unable to replace them, and the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur success largely depends on the continued skills, experience, efforts and policies of our management team and other key personnel and our ability to continue to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified employees. In particular, the services of Michael Favish, our founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, and David Evans, director of the Company and a consultant to VectorVision, are integral to the execution of our business strategy. We believe that the loss of the services of Mr. Favish or Dr. Evans could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that Mr. Favish, Dr. Evans or our other executive officers will continue to provide services to the Company. We do not maintain key man insurance for any of our key personnel.\nThe Company\u2019s future success depends upon its ability to grow. If the Company is unable to manage its growth effectively, it may incur unexpected expenses and be unable to meet its customers\u2019 requirements.\nWe will need to expand our operations if we successfully achieve market acceptance for our products and services. We cannot be certain that our systems, procedures, controls and existing space will be adequate to support expansion of our operations. Our future operating results will depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve our technical, administrative, financial control and reporting systems. We may not be able to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate these increases or we may not have the qualified personnel to implement them. Difficulties in managing any future growth could have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations because we may incur unexpected expenses and be unable to meet our customers\u2019 requirements.\nThe Company may consider acquiring other companies or product lines in an effort to expand its business in exchange for cash and/or stock of the Company (or a combination thereof), which may not be successful, or which may cause dilution to investors.\nThe Company will consider acquiring other companies or product lines that may be complementary or supplementary as part of our future efforts to expand the business, which acquisitions could be for cash, stock or a combination thereof. There is no guarantee that any such acquisition will be successful or that an acquired company\u2019s products, operations or corporate culture will mesh with our Company, integrate well, or that any economies of scale will be realized. In addition, any such transaction that involves the Company\u2019s stock would cause dilution to investors. In addition, any such transaction that involves cash would result in a reallocation of funds on hand that would be needed to support an acquired company or acquired product line.\nIn order to expand the Company\u2019s business into additional states, it may need to comply with regulatory requirements specific to such states and there can be no assurance that it will be able to initially meet such requirements or that it will be able to maintain compliance on an on-going basis.\nWhile we believe our product, Lumega-Z\u00ae, to be a medical food and not a drug, it is only available under the supervision of a physician. While it is not available in pharmacies, we are mindful that the act of physicians prescribing, particularly if conducted across state lines, could potentially be subject to certain pharmacy regulations. Each state has its own regulations concerning physician dispensing, restrictions on the corporate practice of medicine, anti-kickback and false claims. In addition, each state has a board of pharmacy that regulates the sale and distribution of drugs and other therapeutic agents. Some states require a physician to obtain a license to dispense prescription products. While we do not believe these pharmacy requirements are applicable should a pharmacy board or medical board determine otherwise, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the regulations of particular states into which we may expand or that we will be able to maintain compliance with the states in which we currently distribute our products. We currently have Lumega-Z customers in California, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Kentucky, Tennessee, Kansas, Indiana, Illinois, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Mississippi, Idaho, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, Washington, Hawaii and Alberta, Canada. Our inability to maintain compliance with the regulations of California and these other jurisdictions or expand our business into additional states may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to anti-corruption laws, as well as export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations. If it fails to comply with these laws, it could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures and legal expenses, be precluded from developing manufacturing and selling certain products outside the U.S. or be required to develop and implement costly compliance programs, which could adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, or Bribery Act, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries where we do business and may do business in the future. The Bribery Act, FCPA and these other laws generally prohibit us, our officers, and our employees and intermediaries from bribing, being bribed or making other prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. Compliance with the FCPA, in particular, is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.\nWe may in the future operate in jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential Bribery Act or FCPA violations, and we may participate in collaborations and relationships with third parties whose actions could potentially subject us to liability under the Bribery Act, FCPA or local anti-corruption laws. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. If we expand our operations outside of the U.S., we will need to dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate.\nWe are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the governments of the United Kingdom and the U.S., and authorities in the European Union, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions on countries and persons, customs requirements and currency exchange regulations, collectively referred to as the Trade Control laws. In addition, various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the U.S., or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence outside of the U.S., it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the U.S., which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.\nWe may not be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the Bribery Act, the FCPA or other legal requirements, including Trade Control laws. If we are not in compliance with the Bribery Act, the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. The Securities and Exchange Commission also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA\u2019s accounting provisions. Any investigation of any potential violations of the Bribery Act, the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws by U.K., U.S. or other authorities could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s Bylaws have an exclusive forum for adjudication of disputes provision which limits the forum to the Delaware Court of Chancery for certain actions against the Company.\nArticle XI of our Bylaws dictates that the Delaware Court of Chancery is the sole and exclusive forum for certain actions including derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company; an action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty owed by an officer, a director, employee or to the shareholders of the Company; any claim arising under Delaware corporate law; and any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This means a shareholder has a limited forum in which to bring one of the above causes of action, which can be inconvenient for the shareholder.\nA Delaware corporation is allowed to mandate in its corporate governance documents a chosen forum for the resolution of state law based shareholder class actions, derivative suits and other intra-corporate disputes. The Company\u2019s management believes limiting state law based claims to Delaware will provide the most appropriate outcomes as the risk of another forum misapplying Delaware law is avoided. Delaware courts have a well-developed body of case law and limiting the forum will preclude costly and duplicative litigation and avoids the risk of inconsistent outcomes. It also means a shareholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a forum it believes is favorable to shareholders in disputes with directors, officers or other employees is limited and may discourage shareholders from bringing such claims. Additionally, Delaware Chancery Courts can typically resolve disputes on an accelerated schedule when compared to other forums.\nThe Company has no experience in conducting transcranial doppler ultrasound studies.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the new Transcranial Doppler Solutions, Inc. business will depend on its ability to successfully launch and advance a new service in an area where the Company has no experience, which may be a complex, costly and time-consuming process. The Company may be required to devote significant management attention and resources to develop the Transcranial Doppler Solutions, Inc. business. The initiation process may disrupt its business and, if implemented ineffectively, could restrict the realization of the full expected benefits of the new business service. The failure to meet the challenges involved in the initiation process and to realize the anticipated benefits of the new business could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the Company\u2019s operations and could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Industry\nAny failure to comply with all applicable federal and state privacy and security requirements for the protection of patient information may result in fines and other liabilities, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and reputation.\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-191 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, Title XIII of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the \u201cHITECH Act\u201d), and related regulations promulgated by the Secretary (\u201cHIPAA Regulations\u201d) grant a number of rights to individuals as to their identifiable confidential medical information (called \u201cProtected Health Information\u201d) and restrict the use and disclosure of Protected Health Information. Failure to comply with these confidentiality requirements may result in penalties and sanctions. In addition, certain state laws may impose independent obligations upon us with respect to patient-identifiable medical information. Moreover, various new laws relating to the acquisition, storage and transmission of patient medical information have been proposed at both the federal and state level. These laws (collectively, the \u201cState and Federal Privacy and Security Laws\u201d) present different risks as to the Company\u2019s two lines of business: (1) our sale of medical food, Lumega-Z; and (2) our performance of Trans Cranial Doppler (\u201cTCD\u201d) testing.\n1. Medical Food, Lumega-Z. When a physician recommends the Company\u2019s medical food, Lumega-Z, to a patient, the Company typically receives an order from the customer, but does not usually receive medical information. As part of the operation of its business, it is possible, however, that during communication with customers or with physicians the Company might receive patient-identifiable medical information. To the extent the Company obtains access to Protected Health Information, it must ensure it complies with the State and Federal Privacy and Security Laws. Any failure to comply may result in fines and other liabilities, which may adversely affect its results of operations.\n2. The TCD Testing Business. In the TCD Testing line-of-business, the Company will go into physicians\u2019 offices and performs TCD tests on patients, as ordered by the patients\u2019 treating physicians. The Company is establishing agreements with radiologists to read and report on the results of the tests. These results will be reported back to the ordering/treating physician. Finally, the Company will bill for the TCD tests to third party payors. During this process, the Company directly interacts with patients and has access to, processes and transmits Protected Health Information. As a result, the State and Federal Privacy and Security Laws will fully apply to the TCD Testing business. As required by federal law, the Company has been putting into place a HIPAA compliance program, including providing training to staff, instituting appropriate Business Associate Agreements, implementing required policies and procedures, and conducting regular risk assessments. Any failure to comply with the requirements of the State and Federal Privacy and Security Laws - or any loss of Protected Health Information, whether inadvertent or not - may result in fines and other liabilities, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nAny failure to comply with all applicable federal and state physician self-referral law (the \u201cStark Law\u201d) may result in fines and other liabilities, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and reputation.\nCongress enacted significant prohibitions against physician self-referrals in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. This law and its supporting regulations, which have been amended and expanded substantially, are commonly referred to as the \u201cStark Law,\u201d and prohibit a physician from making any referral of a Stark Designated Health Service (\u201cDHS\u201d) to an entity with which the physician has any kind of financial relationship, unless all of the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception are met. Stark covered DHS include both outpatient prescription drugs and diagnostic testing that are reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid. Many states have similar laws, some of which can apply to all payors and not just governmental payors. While the Company believes that its arrangements with its customers are in compliance with the federal and any state Stark Laws, the Stark Laws present different levels of risks as to the Company\u2019s two lines of business: (1) sale of the Company\u2019s medical food, Lumega-Z, and medical device, the MapcatSF; and (2) the Company\u2019s performance of TCD testing.\n1. Medical Food, Lumega-Z, and Medical Device, the MapcatSF. These products are neither prescription drugs nor are they reimbursable under any federal program at present. Therefore, the Company believes that the federal Stark Law is not applicable. Further, the Company\u2019s believes that these products are also not covered under any potentially applicable state Stark Laws. The federal Stark Law, however, includes an exception for the provision of in-office ancillary services, including a physician\u2019s dispensing of outpatient prescription drugs, provided that the physician meets specified requirements. To the extent that the products might become reimbursable under a federal program, or otherwise become covered under the Stark Law, the Company believes that the physicians who use the Company\u2019s medical device, the MapcatSF, or recommend its medical food, Lumega-Z, to their patients are aware of these requirements. However, the Company does not monitor their compliance and has no assurance that the physicians are in material compliance with Stark II. If it were determined that the physicians who use the Company\u2019s medical device or prescribe medical foods purchased from the Company were not in compliance with Stark II, it could potentially have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n2. The TCD Testing Business. The TCD tests performed by the Company can be reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid and otherwise constitute a Stark covered DHS, which include diagnostic testing. Moreover, in conducting TCD tests, the Company will be using space provided by the ordering physician. As a result, the Stark Law applies to the TCD Testing Business, as the ordering physician has a financial relationship with the Company, through the Company\u2019s use of the physician\u2019s space (for which fair market value rent must be charged), and the physician is referring a DHS - the TCD tests - to the Company. In addition, the Company will be enrolling the ordering physicians in clinical research trials and compensating the physicians for their participation in the trials, thereby creating an additional Stark cognizable financial relationship between the parties.\nThe Company believe its planned structure of its relationships with the ordering physicians to be in compliance with all of the requirements of applicable Stark Law exceptions. Any failure to comply the requirements of the Stark Law, however, may result in fines and other liabilities, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, and the future operations of the TCD business could be adversely affected.\nAny failure to comply with all applicable federal and state anti-kickback laws may result in fines and other liabilities, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and reputation.\nThe federal anti-kickback statute (the \u201cAKS\u201d) applies to Medicare, Medicaid and other state and federal programs. AKS prohibits the solicitation, offer, payment or receipt of remuneration in return for referrals or the purchase, or in return for recommending or arranging for the referral or purchase, of goods, including drugs, covered by the federal health care programs. At present, the Company does not participate in any federal programs and its products are not reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid or any other state or federal program. The AKS is a criminal statute with criminal penalties, as well as potential civil and administrative penalties. The AKS, however, provides a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory \u201csafe harbors\u201d for particular types of transactions. Many states have similar fraud and abuse laws and their own anti-kickback laws, some of which can apply to all payors, and not just governmental payors. While the Company believes that it is in material compliance with both federal and state AKS laws, the AKS laws present different levels of risks as to the Company\u2019s two lines of business: (1) sale of the Company\u2019s medical food, Lumega-Z, and medical device, the MapcatSF; and (2) the Company\u2019s performance of TCD testing.\n1. Medical Food, Lumega-Z, and Medical Device, the MapcatSF. At present, the Company\u2019s products are not reimbursable under any federal program. If, however, that changes in the future and it were determined that the Company was not in compliance with the AKS, the Company could be subject to liability, and its operations could be curtailed, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, if the activities of its customers or other entity with which the Company has a business relationship were found to constitute a violation of the AKS and the Company, as a result of the provision of products or services to such customer or entity, were found to have knowingly participated in such activities, the Company could be subject to sanctions or liability under such laws, including civil and/or criminal penalties, as well as exclusion from government health programs. As a result of exclusion from government health programs, neither products nor services could be provided to any beneficiaries of any federal healthcare program.\n2. The TCD Testing Business. The TCD tests performed by the Company can be reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid. As a result, the federal AKS (and potentially any applicable state anti-kickback law) will be implicated to the extent the financial relationships between the physician customers and the Company are not set at a fair market value amount unrelated to the volume or value of TCD tests being ordered. If the Company\u2019s arrangements with ordering physicians were found to constitute a violation of the federal AKS, or any applicable state anti-kickback law, we could be subject to sanctions or liability under such laws, including civil and/or criminal penalties, as well as exclusion from government health programs. As a result of exclusion from government health programs, neither products nor services could be provided to any beneficiaries of any federal healthcare program.\nAs to the TCD Testing line of business, any failure to comply with applicable federal and state documentation, coding and billing laws, rules and regulations, including the federal False Claims or similar state laws, may result in fines and other liabilities, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and reputation.\nThe Federal False Claims Act provides for the imposition of extensive financial penalties (including treble damages and fines of over $22,000 for every false claim) if a provider submits false claims to any governmental health program either knowingly or in reckless disregard or in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the claims at issue. Liability under the False Claims Act can arise from patterns of deficient documentation, coding and billing, as well as for billing for services that are deemed not to have been medically necessary for the treatment of the patient. Many states have their own False Claims Acts as well. The Company intends to bill governmental health care programs for the TCD testing, and the False Claims Act is thus potentially applicable to the Company\u2019s operations. The Company is putting in place a fraud and abuse compliance program that is designed to ensure that the Company\u2019s documentation, coding and billing for TCD tests are accurate and compliant. Any patterns of uncorrected deficiencies in documenting, coding and billing for TCD tests, however, may result in fines and other liabilities, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny failure to comply with all state laws relating to the Corporate Practice of Medicine or fee splitting may result in fines and other liabilities, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations and reputation.\nMany states prohibit or otherwise regulate under Corporate Practice of Medicine (\u201cCPOM\u201d) rules the extent to which non-licensed personnel may be involved in the practice of medicine or otherwise employ licensed personnel. Related state rules further limit the extent to which fees for professional services may be shared or \u201csplit\u201d between parties. Under the TCD Testing line of business, such rules in some states my impact the Company\u2019s relationship with the radiologists who will be reading and interpreting the results of the TCD tests, and thereby providing the \u201cprofessional component\u201d of such tests. The Company is structuring its financial and billing relationships with such radiologists to be in compliance with applicable state rules. Failure to comply with state CPOM and fee splitting rules, however, may result in fines and other liabilities, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased government involvement in healthcare could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nU.S. healthcare system reform under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and other initiatives at both the federal and state level, could increase government involvement in healthcare, lower reimbursement rates and otherwise change the business environment of our customers and the other entities with which we have a business relationship. While no federal price controls are included in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act, any legislation that reduces physician incentives to dispense medications in their offices could adversely affect physician acceptance of our products. We cannot predict whether or when future healthcare reform initiatives at the federal or state level or other initiatives affecting our business will be proposed, enacted or implemented or what impact those initiatives may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our customers and the other entities with which we have a business relationship could react to these initiatives and the uncertainty surrounding these proposals by curtailing or deferring investments, including those for our products. Additionally, government regulation could alter the clinical workflow of physicians, hospitals and other healthcare participants, thereby limiting the utility of our products and services to existing and potential customers and curtailing broad acceptance of our products and services. Additionally, new safe harbors to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and corresponding exceptions to such law may alter the competitive landscape.\nRisks Related to The Company\u2019s Common Stock\nThe Company is an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and it has elected to comply with certain reduced reporting and disclosure requirements which could make its common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we have elected to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which we refer to as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (2) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in this Annual Report and our periodic reports and proxy statements and (3) exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, as an emerging growth company, we are only required to provide two years of audited financial statements and two years of selected financial data in this Annual Report. As a result of these reduced reporting and disclosure requirements our financial statements may not be comparable to SEC registrants not classified as emerging growth companies. We may be an emerging growth company for up to five years following the first sale our equity securities in a public offering, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million before that time or if we have total annual gross revenue of $1.07 billion or more during any fiscal year before that time, in which cases we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31 or, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during any three-year period before that time, we would immediately cease to be an emerging growth company. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until the later of our second annual report or the first annual report required to be filed with the SEC following the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls in the future.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other SEC registrants that are not emerging growth companies.\nInvestors may find our common stock less attractive as a result of our election to utilize these exemptions, which could result in a less active trading market for our common stock and/or the market price of our common stock may be more volatile.\nThe Company\u2019s directors and executive officers beneficially own a significant number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. Their interests may conflict with our outside stockholders, who may be unable to influence management and exercise control over the business.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, our executive officers and directors beneficially own approximately 29.8% of our shares of common stock. As a result, our executive officers and directors may be able to affect the election or defeat the election of our directors, amend or prevent amendment to our certificates of incorporation or bylaws, effect or prevent a merger, sale of assets or other corporate transaction, and control the outcome of any other matter submitted to the shareholders for vote. Accordingly, our outside stockholders may be unable to influence management and exercise control over our business.\nThe Company does not intend to pay cash dividends to its stockholders, so you may not receive any return on your investment in the Company prior to selling your interest in the Company.\nWe have never paid any dividends to our common stockholders and do not foresee doing so as a public company. We currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth and, therefore, do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. If we determine that we will pay cash dividends to the holders of our common stock, we cannot assure that such cash dividends will be paid on a timely basis. The success of your investment in the Company will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation. As a result, you will not receive any return on your investment prior to selling your shares in our Company and, for the other reasons discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, you may not receive any return on your investment even when you sell your shares in our Company.\nThe Company requires additional capital to support its current operations, and this capital has not been readily available.\nWe require additional debt or equity financing to fund our current operations, including, but not limited to, working capital. Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business model and future prospects. Accordingly, investors should consider our prospects in light of the costs, uncertainties, delays and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in the early stages of development, as we have, in fact, encountered. Potential investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties that a new company with a limited operating history and with limited funds, will face. In particular, potential investors should consider that there is a significant risk that we will not be able to:\n\u00b7 implement or execute our current business plan, which may or may not be sound;\n\u00b7 maintain our anticipated management and advisory team; and\n\u00b7 raise sufficient funds in the capital markets to effectuate our business plan.\nIf we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing shareholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our existing capital stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our current operations and to respond to business challenges would be significantly limited. If we cannot access the capital necessary to support our business, we would be forced to curtail our business activities or even shut down operations. If we cannot execute any one of the foregoing or similar matters relating to our business, the business may fail, in which case you would lose the entire amount of your investment in the Company.\nThe obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention, which may divert from the Company\u2019s business operations.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition, proxy statement, and other information. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer need to certify that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that material information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms. We will need to hire additional financial reporting, internal controls and other financial personnel in order to develop and implement appropriate internal controls and reporting procedures. As a result, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. Furthermore, the need to establish the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert management\u2019s attention from implementing our growth strategy, which could prevent us from improving our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a public company. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company. In addition, we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur in order to comply with these requirements. We anticipate that these costs will materially increase our selling, general and administrative expenses.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In connection with the implementation of the necessary procedures and practices related to internal control over financial reporting, we may identify deficiencies. If we are unable to comply with the internal controls requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, then we may not be able to obtain the independent account certifications required by that act, which may preclude us from keeping our filings with the SEC current, and interfere with the ability of investors to trade our securities and our shares to be quoted or our ability to list our shares on any national securities exchange.\nIf the Company fails to establish and maintain an effective system of internal controls, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or prevent fraud. Any inability to report and file its financial results accurately and timely could harm the Company\u2019s reputation and adversely impact the trading price of its common stock.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, we may not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed, and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed. We plan to recruit additional personnel in order to achieve our financial reporting obligations. With each prospective acquisition, we will conduct whatever due diligence is necessary or prudent to assure us that the acquisition target can comply with the internal controls requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Notwithstanding our diligence, certain internal controls deficiencies may not be detected. As a result, any internal control deficiencies may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and access to capital. We have not performed an in-depth analysis to determine if historical undiscovered failures of internal controls exist, and may in the future discover areas of our internal controls that need improvement\nRisks Related to The Company\u2019s Securities\nThe Company\u2019s stock price may be volatile, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the purchase price.\nIn the event that the Company\u2019s common stock becomes listed or traded, the market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u00b7 our ability to execute our business plan;\n\u00b7 changes in our industry;\n\u00b7 competitive pricing pressures;\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain working capital financing;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7 sales of our common stock;\n\u00b7 operating results that fall below expectations;\n\u00b7 regulatory developments;\n\u00b7 economic and other external factors;\n\u00b7 period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results;\n\u00b7 the public\u2019s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including filings with the SEC;\n\u00b7 changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our common stock;\n\u00b7 the development and sustainability of an active trading market for our common stock; and\n\u00b7 any future sales of our common stock by our officers, directors and significant stockholders.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThere can be no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Company\u2019s shares of common stock in the future.\nIf we complete our Public Offering and establish a public market for our securities, the market liquidity will be dependent on the perception of our operating business, among other things. We intend to take certain steps including utilizing investor awareness campaigns and firms, press releases, road shows and conferences to increase awareness of our business. Any steps that we might take to bring us to the awareness of investors may require that we compensate consultants with cash and/or stock. There can be no assurance that there will be any awareness generated or the results of any efforts will result in any impact on our trading volume. Consequently, investors may not be able to liquidate their investment or liquidate it at a price that reflects the value of the business, and trading may be at an inflated price relative to the performance of the Company due to, among other things, the availability of sellers of our shares.\nThe Company may be subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions and you may have difficulty selling shares of its common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock will be subject to the provisions of Section 15(g) and Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act, commonly referred to as the \u201cpenny stock rules.\u201d Section 15(g) sets forth certain requirements for transactions in penny stock, and Rule 15g-9(d) incorporates the definition of \u201cpenny stock\u201d that is found in Rule 3a51-1 of the Exchange Act. The SEC generally defines a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. We will be subject to the SEC\u2019s \u201cpenny stock rules.\u201d The Company may fall within an exception to the \u201cpenny stock rules\u201d described in Rule 3a51-1(g), which states that the stock of an issuer that has net tangible assets in excess of $2,000,000 is not considered a penny stock. There are no assurances that we will fall within this or other exceptions to the \u201cpenny stock rules.\u201d\nIn the event that our common stock is deemed to be penny stock, trading in the shares of our common stock will be subject to additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell penny stock to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. \u201cAccredited investors\u201d are persons with assets in excess of $1,000,000 (excluding the value of such person\u2019s primary residence) or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 together with their spouse. For transactions covered by these rules, broker-dealers must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such security and must have the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. Additionally, for any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt from the rules require the delivery, prior to the first transaction of a risk disclosure document, prepared by the SEC, relating to the penny stock market. A broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stocks held in an account and information to the limited market in penny stocks. Consequently, these rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealer to trade and/or maintain a market in our common stock and may affect the ability of the Company\u2019s stockholders to sell their shares of common stock.\nThere can be no assurance that our shares of common stock will qualify for exemption from the penny stock rules. In any event, even if our common stock was exempt from the penny stock rules, we would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of penny stock if the SEC finds that such a restriction would be in the public interest.\nPublic company compliance may make it more difficult to attract and retain officers and directors.\nThe Sarbanes Oxley Act and rules implemented by the SEC have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. As a public company, these rules and regulations increase our compliance costs and make certain activities more time consuming and costly. As a public company, these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and expensive for us to maintain our director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors or as executive officers, and to maintain insurance at reasonable rates, or at all.", "PERMNO": 18555, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "GHSI"}
