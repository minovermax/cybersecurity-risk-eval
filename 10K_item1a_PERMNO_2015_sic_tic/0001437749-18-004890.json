The following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions relevant to our business includes factors we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. Other factors beyond those listed below, including factors unknown to us and factors known to us which we have not currently determined to be material, could also adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, prospects and cash flows. Also see \u201cForward-looking Statements\u201d above.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nOur limited operating history makes evaluation of our business difficult.\nWe have limited and only nominal historical financial data upon which to base planned operating expenses or forecast accurately our future operating results. Because our operations are not yet sufficient to fund our operational expenses, we rely on investor capital to fund operations. Our limited operational history make it difficult to forecast the need for future financing activities. Further, our limited operating history will make it difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate our business and prospects. Our failure to address these risks and difficulties successfully could seriously harm us.\nWe have never generated any significant revenues, have a history of losses, and cannot assure you that we will ever become or remain profitable.\nWe have not yet generated any significant revenue from operations, and, accordingly, we have incurred net losses every year since our inception. To date, we have dedicated most of our financial resources to research and development, general and administrative expenses, and initial sales and marketing activities. We have funded the majority of our activities through the issuance of convertible debt or equity securities. Although sale of our CupriDyne Clean products are increasing, and we are devoting more energy and money to our sales and marketing activities, we continue to anticipate net losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future. We believe we have the opportunity to reach positive cash flow in 2018, although doing so depends on many factor, including our ability to fund sales and marketing activities, and the rate of client adoption. There can be no assurance that our revenues will be sufficient for us to become profitable or thereafter maintain profitability. We may also face unforeseen problems, difficulties, expenses or delays in implementing our business plan, including generally the need for odor control products in solid waste handling operations, which we may not fully understand or be able to predict.\nOur cash requirements are significant. We will require additional financing to sustain our operations and without it we may not be able to continue operations.\nOur cash requirements and expenses will continue to be significant. Our net cash used in continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $4,300,000, over $350,000 per month. During that same period, we generated only $500,000 in total gross revenues. Thus, in order to become profitable, we must significantly increase our revenues. Although our revenues are increasing through sales of our products and from our engineering division, we expect to continue to use cash in 2018 as it becomes available.\n- 18 -\nAt December 31, 2017, we had working capital deficit of approximately $3,300,000. Our auditor\u2019s report for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes an explanatory paragraph to their audit opinion stating that our recurring losses from operations and working capital deficiency raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our net cash used in continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $4,300,000. We do not currently have sufficient financial resources to fund our operations or those of our subsidiaries. Therefore, we need additional financing to continue these operations.\nIn August 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund LLC (\u201cLincoln Park\u201d) through which we may direct Lincoln Park to purchase shares of our common stock at prices that depend on the market price of our stock (the \u201cLPC Agreement\u201d). Over time, and subject to multiple limitations, we may direct Lincoln Park to purchase up to $10,000,000 of our common stock. Since inception of the LPC Agreement, through December 31, 2017, we directed Lincoln Park to purchase 1,175,000 shares of our common stock, and received $511,085 in proceeds. Since December 31, 2017, through March 9, 2018, we directed Lincoln Park to purchase 550,000 shares of our common stock, and received $143,165 in proceeds. The extent to which we rely on Lincoln Park as a source of funding in 2018 will depend on a number of factors, including the prevailing market price of our common stock, and the extent to which we are able to secure working capital from other sources. If obtaining sufficient funding from Lincoln Park were to prove unavailable or prohibitively dilutive, we will need to secure another source of funding in order to satisfy our working capital needs. Even if we were receive the full maximum commitment of $10,000,000 in aggregate gross proceeds from sales of our common stock to Lincoln Park during the 3 year term of the LPC Agreement, we may still need additional capital to fully implement our business, operating and development plans. Should the financing we require to sustain our working capital needs be unavailable or prohibitively expensive when we require it, the consequences could be a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nFrom time to time, we issue stock, instead of cash, to pay some of our operating expenses. These issuances are dilutive to our existing stockholders.\nWe are party to agreements that provide for the payment of, or permit us to pay at our option, securities in consideration for services provided to us. We include these provisions in agreements but it allows us to preserve cash. Additionally, we routinely pay employees, vendors and consultants in stock or stock options at a premium, rather than cash, for services provided, and we anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future. All such issuances are dilutive to our stockholders because they increase (and will increase in the future) the total number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, even though such arrangements assist us with managing our cash flow. These issuances also increase the expense amount recorded.\nOur stockholders face further potential dilution in any new financing.\nOur private securities offerings typically provide for convertible securities, including notes and warrants. Any additional capital that we raise would dilute the interest of the current stockholders and any persons who may become stockholders before such financing. Given the low price of our common stock, such dilution in any financing of a significant amount could be substantial.\nOur stockholders face further potential adverse effects from the terms of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future.\nIn order to raise capital to meet expenses or to acquire a business, our board of directors may issue additional stock, including preferred stock. Any preferred stock that we may issue may have voting rights, liquidation preferences, redemption rights and other rights, preferences and privileges. The rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to, and in many respects subordinate to, the rights of the holders of any such preferred stock. Furthermore, such preferred stock may have other rights, including economic rights, senior to our common stock that could have a material adverse effect on the value of our common stock. Preferred stock, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, can also have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock, thereby delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company.\n- 19 -\nSome of our promissory notes due in 2018 have conversion features at more than our current stock price, and thus the holders of these notes may choose not to convert to stock, forcing us to pay the note at maturity with cash, or renegotiate terms.\nJuly 18, 2018 is the maturity date for a convertible promissory note with $280,000 principal amount outstanding. September 18, 2018, is the maturity date for a convertible promissory note with $500,000 principal amount outstanding. October 16, 2018 is the maturity date for a convertible promissory note with $150,000 principal amount outstanding. The holder of these notes may convert the note to stock at any time, at varying prices, all of which are above the current market price of our common stock. Rather than choose to convert the note to stock at a loss, the investors may instead require us to pay them in cash, or renegotiate their terms. At December 31, 2017, we had approximately $1,000,000 in cash and cash equivalents. We can not predict our available cash at the maturity dates of these notes. If our stock price does not increase, and we do not have sufficient cash to pay these notes, or are unable to renegotiate the terms of these notes, we may be in default of the notes. A default on these notes could have cascading consequences, including causing defaults of other security agreements.\nThere are several specific business opportunities we are considering in further development of our business. None of these opportunities is yet the subject of a definitive agreement, and most or all of these opportunities will require additional funding obligations on our part, for which funding is not currently in place.\nIn furtherance of our business plan, we are presently considering a number of opportunities to promote our business, to further develop and broaden, and to license, our technology with third parties. While discussions are underway with respect to such opportunities, there are no definitive agreements in place with respect to any of such opportunities at this time. There can be no assurance that any of such opportunities being discussed will result in definitive agreements or, if definitive agreements are entered into, that they will be on terms that are favorable to us.\nMoreover, should any of these opportunities result in definitive agreements being executed or consummated, we may be required to expend additional monies above and beyond our current operating budget to promote such endeavors. No such financing is in place at this time for such endeavors, and we cannot assure you that any such financing will be available, or if it is available, whether it will be on terms that are favorable to our company.\nWe expect to incur future losses and may not be able to achieve profitability.\nAlthough we are generating limited revenue from the sale of our products, and we expect to generate revenue from new products we are introducing, and eventually from other license or supply agreements, we anticipate net losses and negative cash flow to continue for the foreseeable future until our products are expanded in the marketplace and they gain broader acceptance by resellers and customers. Our current level of sales is not sufficient to support the financial needs of our business. We cannot predict when or if sales volumes will be sufficiently large to cover our operating expenses. We intend to expand our marketing efforts of our products as financial resources are available, and we intend to continue to expand our research and development efforts. Consequently, we will need to generate significant additional revenue or seek additional financings to fund our operations. This has put a proportionate corresponding demand on capital. Our ability to achieve profitability is dependent upon our efforts to deliver a viable product and our ability to successfully bring it to market, which we are currently pursuing. Although our management is optimistic that we will succeed in licensing our technology, we cannot be certain as to timing or whether we will generate sufficient revenue to be able to operate profitably. If we cannot achieve or sustain profitability, then we may not be able to fund our expected cash needs or continue our operations. If we are not able to devote adequate resources to promote commercialization of our technology, then our business plans will suffer and may fail.\n- 20 -\nBecause we have limited resources to devote to sales, marketing and licensing efforts with respect to our technology, any delay in such efforts may jeopardize future research and development of technologies and commercialization of our technology. Although our management believes that it can finance commercialization efforts through sales of our securities and possibly other capital sources, if we do not successfully bring our technology to market, our ability to generate revenues will be adversely affected.\nWe have determined that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting are currently not effective. The lack of effective internal controls could materially adversely affect our financial condition and ability to carry out our business plan.\nOur management team for financial reporting, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls. Recognizing the dynamic nature and growth of the Company\u2019s business in the year ended December 31, 2017, including the addition of an engineering division, growth of the core operations, and the increase in the number of employees, management has recognized the strain on the overall internal control environment. As a result, management has concluded that its internal controls over financial reporting are not effective. Management identified a material weakness with respect to deficiencies in its financial closing and reporting procedures. Management believes this is due to a lack of resources. Management intends to add accounting personnel and operating staff and more sophisticated systems in order to improve its reporting procedures and internal controls, subject to available capital. Until we have adequate resources to increase address these issues, any material weaknesses may materially adversely affect our ability to report accurately our financial condition and results of operations in the future in a timely and reliable manner. In addition, although we continually review and evaluate internal control systems to allow management to report on the sufficiency of our internal controls, we cannot assure you that we will not discover additional weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Any such additional weakness or failure to remediate the existing weakness could materially adversely affect our financial condition or ability to comply with applicable financial reporting requirements and the requirements of the Company\u2019s various financing agreements.\nIf we are not able to manage our anticipated growth effectively, we may not become profitable.\nWe anticipate that expansion will continue to be required to address potential market opportunities for our technology and our products. Our existing infrastructure is limited While we believe our current manufacturing processes as well as our office and warehousing provides the basic resources to expand as we grow sales of Cupridyne Clean to more than $2 million per month, our infrastructure will need more staffing to support manufacturing, customer service, administration as well as sales/account executive functions. There can be no assurance that we will have the financial resources to create new infrastructure, or that any such infrastructure will be sufficiently scalable to manage future growth, if any. There also can be no assurance that, if we invest in additional infrastructure, we will be effective in expanding our operations or that our systems, procedures or controls will be adequate to support such expansion. In addition, we will need to provide additional sales and support services to our partners if we achieve our anticipated growth with respect to the sale of our technology for various applications. Failure to properly manage an increase in customer demands could result in a material adverse effect on customer satisfaction, our ability to meet our contractual obligations, and our operating results.\nSome of the products incorporating our technology will require regulatory approval.\nThe products in which our technology may be incorporated have both regulated and non-regulated applications. The regulatory approvals for certain applications may be difficult, impossible, time consuming and/or expensive to obtain. While our management believes such approvals can be obtained for the applications contemplated, until those approvals from the FDA or the EPA or other regulatory bodies, at the federal and state levels, as may be required are obtained, we may not be able to generate commercial revenues for regulated products. Certain specific regulated applications and their use require highly technical analysis and additional third-party validation and will require regulatory approvals from organizations like the FDA. Certain applications may also be subject to additional state and local agency regulations, increasing the cost and time associated with commercial strategies. Additionally, most products incorporating our technology that may be sold in the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) will require EU and possibly also individual country regulatory approval. All such approvals, including additional testing, are time-consuming, expensive and do not have assured outcomes of ultimate regulatory approval.\n- 21 -\nWe need to outsource and rely on third parties for the manufacture of the chemicals, material components or delivery apparatus used in our technology, and part of our future success will be dependent on the timeliness and effectiveness of the efforts of these third parties.\nWe do not have the required financial and human resources or capability to manufacture the chemicals that comprise our technology. Our business model calls for the outsourcing of the manufacture of these chemicals in order to reduce our capital and infrastructure costs as a means of potentially improving our financial position and the profitability of our business. Accordingly, we must enter agreements with other companies that can assist us and provide certain capabilities, including sourcing and manufacturing, which we do not possess. We may not be successful in entering into such alliances on favorable terms or at all. Even if we do succeed in securing such agreements, we may not be able to maintain them. Furthermore, any delay in entering into agreements could delay the development and commercialization of our technology or reduce its competitiveness even if it reaches the market. Any such delay related to such future agreements could adversely affect our business.\nIf any party to which we have outsourced certain functions fails to perform its obligations under agreements with us, the commercialization of our technology could be delayed or curtailed.\nTo the extent that we rely on other companies to manufacture the chemicals used in our technology, or sell or market products incorporating our technology, we will be dependent on the timeliness and effectiveness of their efforts. If any of these parties does not perform its obligations in a timely and effective manner, the commercialization of our technology could be delayed or curtailed because we may not have sufficient financial resources or capabilities to continue such efforts on our own.\nWe rely on a small number of key supply ingredients in order to manufacture our products.\nAll of the supply ingredients used to manufacture our products are readily available from multiple suppliers. However, commodity prices for these ingredients can vary significantly, and the margins that we are able to generate could decline if prices rise. If our manufacturing costs rise significantly, we may be forced to raise the prices for our products, which may reduce their acceptance in the marketplace.\nIf our technology or products incorporating our technology do not gain market acceptance, it is unlikely that we will become profitable.\nThe potential markets for products into which our technology can be incorporated are rapidly evolving, and we have many successful competitors including some of the largest and most well-established companies in the world (see, herein: \u201cDescription of Business-Competition.\u201d) At this time, our technology is unproven in commercial use, and the use of our technology by others, and the sales of our products, is nominal. Although our industrial odor control product, CupriDyne Clean, has been through many commercial trials, few clients have purchased the product, and we consider this experience to be early and not complete. The commercial success of products incorporating our technology will depend on the adoption of our technology by commercial and consumer end users in various fields.\nMarket acceptance may depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe willingness and ability of consumers and industry partners to adopt new technologies from a company with little or no history in the industry;\n\u25cf\nour ability to convince potential industry partners and consumers that our technology is an attractive alternative to other competing technologies;\n\u25cf\nour ability to license our technology in a commercially effective manner;\n- 22 -\n\u25cf\nour ability to continue to fund operations while our products move through the process of gaining acceptance, before the time in which we are able to scale up production to obtain economies of scale; and\n\u25cf\nour ability to overcome brand loyalties.\nIf products incorporating our technology do not achieve a significant level of market acceptance, then demand for our technology itself may not develop as expected, and, in such event, it is unlikely that we will become profitable.\nAny revenues that we may earn in the future are unpredictable, and our operating results are likely to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nWe believe that our future operating results will fluctuate due to a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\ndelays in product development by us or third parties;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of products incorporating our technology;\n\u2022\nchanges in the demand for, and pricing of, products incorporating our technology;\n\u2022\ncompetition and pricing pressure from competitive products; and\n\u2022\nexpenses related to, and the results of, proceedings relating to our intellectual property.\nWe expect our operating expenses will continue to fluctuate significantly in 2018 and beyond, as we continue our research and development and increase our marketing and licensing activities. Although we expect to generate revenues from licensing our technology in the future, revenues may decline or not grow as anticipated, and our operating results could be substantially harmed for a particular fiscal period. Moreover, our operating results in some quarters may not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors. In that case, our stock price most likely would decline.\nSome of our revenue is dependent on the award of new contracts from the U.S. government, which we do not directly control.\nA substantial portion of our revenue and is generated from sales to the U.S. defense logistics agency through a bid process in response to request for bids. The timing and size of requests for bids is unpredictable and outside of our control. The number of other companies competing for these bids is also unpredictable and outside of our control. In the event of more competition for these awards, we may have to reduce our margins. These variables make it difficult to predict when or if we will sell more products to the US government, which in turns makes it difficult to stock inventory and purchase raw materials.\nWe have limited product distribution experience, and we rely in part on third parties who may not successfully sell our products.\nWe have limited product distribution experience and rely in part on product distribution arrangements with third parties. In our future product offerings, we may rely solely on third parties for product sales and distribution. We also plan to license our technology to certain third parties for commercialization of certain applications. We expect to enter into additional distribution agreements and licensing agreements in the future, and we may not be able to enter into these additional agreements on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. In addition, we may have limited or no control over the distribution activities of these third parties. These third parties could sell competing products and may devote insufficient sales efforts to our products. As a result, our future revenues from sales of our products, if any, will depend on the success of the efforts of these third parties.\n- 23 -\nWe may not be able to attract or retain qualified senior personnel.\nWe believe we are currently able to manage our current business with our existing management team. However, as we expand the scope of our operations, we will need to obtain the full-time services of additional senior management and other personnel. Competition for highly-skilled personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain qualified senior personnel. Our failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our business plan. As we add full-time senior personnel, our overhead expenses for salaries and related items will increase from current levels and, depending upon the number of personnel we hire and their compensation packages, these increases could be substantial.\nIf we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel, we may be unable to achieve profitability.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the efforts of our senior management, particularly Dennis P. Calvert, our president and chief executive officer. The loss of the services of Mr. Calvert or other members of our senior management may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of product development and other business objectives. Because of the scientific nature of our business, we depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain qualified marketing, scientific and technical personnel. There is intense competition among specialized and technologically-oriented companies for qualified personnel in the areas of our activities. If we lose the services of, or do not successfully recruit, key marketing, scientific and technical personnel, then the growth of our business could be substantially impaired. At present, we do not maintain key man insurance for any of our senior management, although management is evaluating the potential of securing this type of insurance in the future as may be available.\nNondisclosure agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nIn order to protect our proprietary technology and processes, we rely in part on nondisclosure agreements with our employees, potential licensing partners, potential manufacturing partners, testing facilities, universities, consultants, agents and other organizations to which we disclose our proprietary information. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information, and in such cases we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position. Since we rely on trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements, in addition to patents, to protect some of our intellectual property, there is a risk that third parties may obtain and improperly utilize our proprietary information to our competitive disadvantage. We may not be able to detect unauthorized use or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights.\nWe may become subject to product liability claims.\nAs a business that manufactures and markets products for use by consumers and institutions, we may become liable for any damage caused by our products, whether used in the manner intended or not. Any such claim of liability, whether meritorious or not, could be time-consuming and/or result in costly litigation. Although we maintain general liability insurance, our insurance may not cover potential claims of the types described above and may not be adequate to indemnify for all liabilities that may be imposed. Any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could harm our business and operating results, and you may lose some or all of any investment you have made, or may make, in our company.\n- 24 -\nLitigation or the actions of regulatory authorities may harm our business or otherwise distract our management.\nSubstantial, complex or extended litigation could cause us to incur major expenditures and distract our management. For example, lawsuits by employees, former employees, investors, stockholders, partners, customers or others, or actions taken by regulatory authorities, could be very costly and substantially disrupt our business. As a result of our financing activities over time, and by virture of the number of people that have invested in our company, we face increased risk of lawsuits from investors. Such lawsuits or actions could from time to time be filed against our company and/or our executive officers and directors. Such lawsuits and actions are not uncommon, and we cannot assure you that we will always be able to resolve such disputes or actions on terms favorable to our company.\nIf we suffer negative publicity concerning the safety or efficacy of our products, our sales may be harmed.\nIf concerns should arise about the safety or efficacy of any of our products that are marketed, regardless of whether or not such concerns have a basis in generally accepted science or peer-reviewed scientific research, such concerns could adversely affect the market for those products. Similarly, negative publicity could result in an increased number of product liability claims, whether or not those claims are supported by applicable law.\nThe licensing of our technology or the manufacture, use or sale of products incorporating our technology may infringe on the patent rights of others, and we may be forced to litigate if an intellectual property dispute arises.\nIf we infringe or are alleged to have infringed another party\u2019s patent rights, we may be required to seek a license, defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of the patents in court. Patent litigation is costly and time consuming. We may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion. In addition, if we do not obtain a license, do not successfully defend an infringement action or are unable to have infringed patents declared invalid, we may:\n\u2022\nincur substantial monetary damages;\n\u2022\nencounter significant delays in marketing our current and proposed product candidates;\n\u2022\nbe unable to conduct or participate in the manufacture, use or sale of product candidates or methods of treatment requiring licenses;\n\u2022\nlose patent protection for our inventions and products; or\n\u2022\nfind our patents are unenforceable, invalid or have a reduced scope of protection.\nParties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive relief that could effectively block our company\u2019s ability to further develop or commercialize our current and proposed product candidates in the United States and abroad and could result in the award of substantial damages. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any such license could substantially harm our company. Litigation, regardless of outcome, could result in substantial cost to, and a diversion of efforts by, our company.\n- 25 -\nOur patents are expensive to maintain, our patent applications are expensive to prosecute, and thus we are unable to file for patent protection in many countries.\nOur ability to compete effectively will depend in part on our ability to develop and maintain proprietary aspects of our technology and either to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others or to obtain rights to technology owned by third parties. Pending patent applications relating to our technology may not result in the issuance of any patents or any issued patents that will offer protection against competitors with similar technology. We must employ patent attorneys to prosecute our patent applications both in the United States and internationally. International patent protection requires the retention of patent counsel and the payment of patent application fees in each foreign country in which we desire patent protection, on or before filing deadlines set forth by the International Patent Cooperation Treaty (\u201cPCT\u201d). We therefore choose to file patent applications only in foreign countries where we believe the commercial opportunities require it, considering our available financial resources and the needs for our technology. This has resulted, and will continue to result, in the irrevocable loss of patent rights in all but a few foreign jurisdictions.\nPatents we receive may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented in the future, or the rights created by those patents may not provide a competitive advantage. We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing invention to develop and maintain our competitive position. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.\nWe are subject to risks related to future business outside of the United States.\nOver time, we may develop business relationships outside of North America, and as those efforts are pursued, we will face risks related to those relationships such as:\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations;\n\u2022\nunstable political, economic, financial and market conditions;\n\u2022\nimport and export license requirements;\n\u2022\ntrade restrictions;\n\u2022\nincreases in tariffs and taxes;\n\u2022\nhigh levels of inflation;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on repatriating foreign profits back to the United States;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles;\n\u2022\nless favorable intellectual property laws, and the lack of intellectual property legal protection;\n\u2022\nregulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nunfamiliarity with foreign laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nchanges in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations.\nThe volatility of certain raw material costs may adversely affect operations and competitive price advantages for products that incorporate our technology.\nMost of the chemicals and other key materials that we use in our business, such as minerals, fiber materials and packaging materials, are neither generally scarce nor price sensitive, but prices for such chemicals and materials can be cyclical. Super Absorbent Polymer (SAP) beads, which are a petrochemical derivative, have been subject to periodic scarcity and price volatility from time to time during recent years, although prices are relatively stable at present. Should the volume of our sales increase dramatically, we may have difficulty obtaining SAP beads or other raw materials at a favorable price. Supply and demand factors, which are beyond our control, generally affect the price of our raw materials. We try to minimize the effect of price increases through production efficiency and the use of alternative suppliers. If we are unable to minimize the effects of increased raw material costs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\n- 26 -\nCertain of our products sales historically have been highly impacted by fluctuations in seasons and weather.\nIndustrial odor control products have proven highly effective in controlling volatile organic compounds that are released as vapors produced by decomposing waste material. Such vapors are produced with the highest degree of intensity in temperatures between 40 degrees Fahrenheit (5 degrees Celsius) and 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius). When weather patterns are cold or in times of precipitation, our clients are less prone to use our odor control products, presumably because such vapors are less noticeable or, in the case of precipitation, can be washed away or altered. This leads to unpredictability in use and sales patterns.\nThe cost of maintaining our public company reporting obligations is high.\nWe are obligated to maintain our periodic public filings and public reporting requirements, on a timely basis, under the rules and regulations of the SEC. In order to meet these obligations, we will need to continue to raise capital. If adequate funds are not available, we will be unable to comply with those requirements and could cease to be qualified to have our stock traded in the public market. As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as related rules adopted by the SEC, has imposed substantial requirements on public companies, including certain corporate governance practices and requirements relating to internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nThe sale or issuance of our common stock to Lincoln Park may cause dilution, and the sale of the shares of common stock acquired by Lincoln Park, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the price of our common stock to fall.\nOn August 25, 2017, we entered into the LPC Agreement with Lincoln Park, pursuant to which Lincoln Park has committed to purchase up to $10,000,000 of our common stock. Concurrently with the execution of the LPC Agreement, we issued 488,998 shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park as an initial fee for its commitment to purchase shares of our common stock under the LPC Agreement. The purchase shares that may be sold pursuant to the LPC Agreement may be sold by us to Lincoln Park at our discretion from time to time over a 36-month period commencing September 22, 2017. The purchase price for the shares that we may sell to Lincoln Park under the LPC Agreement will fluctuate based on the price of our common stock. Depending on market liquidity at the time, sales of such shares may cause the trading price of our common stock to fall. In addition, our company will issue up to an additional 488,998 commitment shares, pro rata for no additional consideration, when and if Lincoln Park purchases (at our discretion) the $10,000,000 aggregate commitment. For example, if we elect, at our sole discretion, to require Lincoln Park to purchase $25,000 of our stock then we would issue 1,222 additional commitment shares, which is the product of $25,000 (the amount we have elected to sell) divided by $10,000,000 (total amount we can sell to Lincoln Park pursuant to the LPC Agreement) multiplied by 488,998 (the total number of additional commitment shares). The additional commitment shares will only be issued pursuant to this formula as and when we elect at our discretion to sell stock to Lincoln Park.\n- 27 -\nWe generally have the right to control the timing and amount of any sales of our shares to Lincoln Park. Sales of our common stock, if any, to Lincoln Park will depend on market conditions and other factors to be determined by us. We may ultimately decide to sell to Lincoln Park all, some or none of the shares of our common stock that may be available for us to sell pursuant to the LPC Agreement. If and when we do sell shares to Lincoln Park, after Lincoln Park has acquired the shares, Lincoln Park may resell all, some or none of those shares at any time or from time to time in its discretion. Therefore, sales to Lincoln Park by us could result in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock. Additionally, the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park, or the anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise desire to effect sales.\nOur common stock is thinly traded and largely illiquid.\nOur stock is currently quoted on the OTC Markets (OTCQB). Being quoted on the OTCQB has made it more difficult to buy or sell our stock and from time to time has led to a significant decline in the frequency of trades and trading volume. Continued trading on the OTCQB will also likely adversely affect our ability to obtain financing in the future due to the decreased liquidity of our shares and other restrictions that certain investors have for investing in OTCQB traded securities. While we intend to seek listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) or another stock exchange when our company is eligible, there can be no assurance when or if our common stock will be listed on Nasdaq or another stock exchange.\nThe market price of our stock is subject to volatility.\nBecause our stock is thinly traded, its price can change dramatically over short periods, even in a single day. An investment in our stock is subject to such volatility and, consequently, is subject to significant risk. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to many factors, including:\n\u2022\ndevelopments with respect to patents or proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements of new products or new contracts by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our operating results due to the level of development expenses and other factors;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by securities analysts and whether any future earnings of ours meet or exceed such estimates;\n\u2022\nconditions and trends in our industry;\n\u2022\nnew accounting standards;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, political and market conditions and other factors; and\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of any of the risks described in this Annual Report.\nYou may have difficulty selling our shares because they are deemed \u201cpenny stocks\u201d.\nBecause our common stock is not quoted on the Nasdaq National Market or Nasdaq Capital Market or listed on a national securities exchange, if the trading price of our common stock remains below $5.00 per share, which we expect for the foreseeable future, trading in our common stock will be subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), which require additional disclosure by broker-dealers in connection with any trades involving a stock defined as a penny stock (generally, any non-Nasdaq equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions). Such rules require the delivery, before any penny stock transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated therewith and impose various sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally defined as an investor with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 individually or $300,000 together with a spouse). For these types of transactions, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction before the sale. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to the broker-dealer and current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer\u2019s presumed control over the market. Such information must be provided to the customer orally or in writing before or with the written confirmation of trade sent to the customer. Monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. The additional burdens imposed on broker-dealers by such requirements could discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock, which could severely limit the market liquidity of our common stock and the ability of holders of our common stock to sell their shares.\n- 28 -\nBecause our shares are deemed \u201cpenny stocks,\u201d new rules make it more difficult to remove restrictive legends.\nRules put in place by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) require broker-dealers to perform due diligence before depositing unrestricted common shares of penny stocks, and as such, some broker-dealers, including many large national firms (such as eTrade and Charles Schwab), are refusing to deposit previously restricted common shares of penny stocks. As such, it may be more difficult for purchases of shares in our private securities offerings to deposit the shares with broker-dealers and sell those shares on the open market.\nBecause we will not pay dividends in the foreseeable future, stockholders will only benefit from owning common stock if it appreciates.\nWe have never declared or paid a cash dividend to stockholders. We intend to retain any earnings that may be generated in the future to finance operations. Accordingly, any potential investor who anticipates the need for current dividends from his investment should not purchase our common stock.", "PERMNO": 77238, "SIC": 2860, "TIC": "BLGO"}
