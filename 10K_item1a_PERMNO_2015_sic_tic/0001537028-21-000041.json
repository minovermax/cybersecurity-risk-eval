{"cik": "1537028", "company": "Independence Contract Drilling, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe face many challenges and risks in the industry in which we operate. You should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, and the documents and other information incorporated by reference herein, before investing in our shares. The risks and uncertainties described are not the only ones we face. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also adversely affect us. If any of these risks were actually to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our shares could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nKey Risks Related to Our Business and Operations\nDue to the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the oil and gas industry, our operating rig count dropped rapidly, and as a result, we reported negative cash flow from operations during the third and fourth quarters of 2020. We cannot assure you when we will again generate positive cash flow from operations or that our operating rig count will not decline again. Depending upon the duration of this decline and the length of time it takes for our operating rig count to improve, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, our operating rig count reached a peak of 22 rigs. Market deterioration largely caused by COVID-19 subsequently caused our customers to reduce drilling activity, which has resulted in a rapid decline in our operating rig count, reaching a low of three rigs during the third quarter of 2020. We were able to reactivate rigs in late 2020 and had eight rigs operating and eleven rigs under contracts as of December 31, 2020. However, even with these improvements, we reported negative cash flow from operations during the third and fourth quarters of 2020, and we expect that market conditions need to improve further for us to generate positive cash flow from operations. Due to the lack of visibility and confidence towards customer intentions, we cannot assure you that our rig count will not decline from these year-end levels. We also cannot assure you that market conditions will improve and if or when our operating rig count will improve further or reach pre-COVID-19 levels or when we will again report positive cash flow from operations. Maintaining our current operating rig count without improvement in 2021 could materially adverse effect our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a result of the ongoing decline in our operating rig count, together with associated dayrate pressure and margin contraction, in the current oil and gas operating environment our cash flows from operations have decreased dramatically, and we will need to draw on other sources of available liquidity until market conditions improve in order to maintain operations and make required non-operating expenditures. Current sources of liquidity at December 31, 2020 included $12.3 million of cash, $7.5 million of availability under our revolving credit facility, $5.0 million of availability from an equity line of credit common stock purchase agreement and $15 million available under our term loan accordion. We currently believe that these sources of liquidity are sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months from issuance, but this assumes that both our operating rig count and dayrates continue to increase steadily from current levels during first half of 2021 in response to recently improving market conditions. Due to the uncertainty regarding the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on the oil and gas industry, we cannot predict the length of time that the market disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic will continue, if market conditions will continue to improve or when, or if, oil and gas prices and demand for our contract drilling services will return to pre-COVID-19 levels. As a result, we cannot assure that our current sources of financial liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations, and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a result of the significant downturn in the oil and gas business and demand for our contract drilling services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we could lose our listing on the New York Stock Exchange, which could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock.\nUnder New York Stock Exchange listing requirements, in order to maintain our listing status we are required to maintain at all times a minimum 30-day trading average public market capitalization of $15 million. Unlike certain other listing standards tied to minimum share price, there is no cure period or grace period associated with this listing standard. As of December 31, 2020, we estimated that our 30-day average market capitalization was approximately $20.6 million, and has increased to $27.2 million as of February 22, 2021. Because we cannot predict the length of time that the market disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic will continue or when, or if, demand for our contract drilling services will begin to improve or return to pre-COVID-19 levels, or when, or if, a general decline in the stock market could occur, we cannot assure you that our common stock will remain listed on the New York Stock Exchange, which could have a material adverse effect on the trading value of our common stock and our ability to raise additional funds through new issuances.\nWe derive all our revenues from companies in the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry, a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility in oil and natural gas prices.\nAs a provider of land-based contract drilling services, our business depends on the level of exploration and production activity by oil and natural gas companies operating in the United States, and in particular, the regions where we actively market our contract drilling services. The oil and natural gas exploration and production industry is a historically cyclical industry characterized by significant changes in the levels of exploration and development activities. Oil and natural gas prices and market expectations of potential changes in those prices significantly affect the levels of those activities. Worldwide political, regulatory, economic, and military events as well as natural disasters have contributed to oil and natural gas price volatility and are likely to continue to do so in the future. Any prolonged reduction in the overall level of exploration and development activities in the United States and the regions where we market our contract drilling services, whether resulting from changes in oil and natural gas prices, an increase in the use of alternative forms of energy and reduction in demand for oil and natural gas, or otherwise, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDepending on the market prices of oil and natural gas, oil and natural gas exploration and production companies may cancel or curtail their drilling programs and may lower production spending on existing wells, thereby reducing demand for our services. Many factors beyond our control affect oil and natural gas prices, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022the cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u2022the discovery and development rate of new oil and natural gas reserves, especially shale and other unconventional natural gas resources for which we market our rigs;\n\u2022the rate of decline of existing and new oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022available pipeline and other oil and natural gas transportation capacity;\n\u2022the levels of oil and natural gas storage;\n\u2022the ability of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies to raise capital;\n\u2022economic conditions in the United States and elsewhere;\n\u2022actions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries;\n\u2022political instability in the Middle East and other major oil and natural gas producing regions;\n\u2022governmental regulations, sanctions and trade restrictions, both domestic and foreign;\n\u2022domestic and foreign tax policy;\n\u2022the availability of and constraints in pipeline, storage and other transportation capacity in the basins in which we operate, including, for example, takeaway constraints experienced in the Permian Basin;\n\u2022weather conditions in the United States;\n\u2022the pace adopted by foreign governments for the exploration, development and production of their national reserves;\n\u2022the price of foreign imports of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022the strength or weakness of the United States dollar;\n\u2022the overall supply and demand for oil and natural gas; and\n\u2022the development of alternate energy sources and the long-term effects of worldwide energy conservation measures.\nIn addition, if oil and natural gas prices decline, companies that planned to finance exploration, development or production projects through the capital markets may be forced to curtail, reduce, postpone or delay drilling activities even further, and also may experience an inability to pay suppliers. Adverse conditions in the global economic environment could also impact our vendors\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 ability to meet obligations to provide materials and services in general. If any of the foregoing were to occur, or if current depressed market conditions continue for a prolonged period of time, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results and our ability to timely and successfully implement our growth strategy.\nDuring 2020, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) and Russia (collectively \u201cOPEC+\u201d) instituted production cuts in order to support oil prices during the period of reduced demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. During January 2021, OPEC+ announced that it would largely continue such lower production through February and March of 2021, with Russia and Kazakhstan producing more and Saudi Arabia voluntarily cutting its production by one million barrels per day from January levels. Although oil prices have recovered from historic 2020 lows, the sustainability of these price levels and the continuation of prior OPEC+ production cuts remains uncertain. Because of this uncertainty, most of our exploration and production (\u201cE&P\u201d) customers have not significantly increased capital expenditure budgets despite improvements in commodity prices. If oil prices were to fall again as a result of prolonged demand destruction caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or increased supply from OPEC+, and remain below $50 per barrel for an extended period, we believe demand for contract drilling services would again soften over current levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nAny loss of large customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur customer base consists of E&P companies that drill oil and natural gas wells in the United States in the regions where we market our rigs. As of December 31, 2020, we have rigs operating or earning revenues from six different customers, including one customer who has contracted three, or 27%, of our contracted rigs. It is likely that we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from a relatively small number of customers in the future. If a customer decided not to continue to use our services or to terminate an existing contract, or if there is a change of management or ownership of a customer or a material adverse change in the financial condition of one of our customers, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows, and financial condition.\nAll of our operating rigs are operating under contracts with terms expiring during 2021. If we are unable to continue to operate rigs in the spot-market or renew our expiring contracts or continue their operation in the spot-market, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nUpon expiration of a drilling contract, our customers have no obligation to extend the contract term or recontract the drilling rig, and may elect to release the rig. All of our existing contracts expire during 2021. We cannot assure that a customer will continue to renew contracts as they expire or that any replacement contract can be obtained for any of our rigs operating in the spot-market or with terms expiring, and if obtained, that it would be on terms as favorable as those of our existing drilling contracts or at profitable levels. The failure to renew or timely replace one or more of our expiring contracts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations involve operating hazards, which if not insured or indemnified against, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to the many hazards inherent in the drilling and well services industries, including the risks of personal injury and loss of life, blowouts, cratering, fires and explosions, loss of well control, collapse of the borehole, damaged or lost drilling equipment, and damage or loss from extreme weather and natural disasters.\nAny of these hazards can result in substantial liabilities or losses to us from, among other things, suspension of operations, damage to, or destruction of, our property and equipment and that of others, damage to producing or potentially productive oil and natural gas formations through which we drill, and environmental damage.\nAlthough, we seek to protect ourselves from some but not all operating hazards through insurance coverage, some risks are either not insurable or insurance is available only at rates that we consider uneconomical. Depending on competitive conditions and other factors, we attempt to obtain contractual protection against uninsured operating risks from our customers. However, customers who provide contractual indemnification protection may not in all cases maintain adequate insurance or otherwise have the financial resources necessary to support their indemnification obligations. Our insurance or indemnification arrangements may not adequately protect us against liability or loss from all the hazards of our operations. We do not carry loss of business insurance for a rig being out of service.\nWe maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the potential risks affecting our operations and only in coverage amounts and deductible levels that we believe to be economical. Our insurance coverage includes deductibles which must be met prior to recovery. Additionally, our insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations, and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages. The occurrence of a significant event that we have not fully insured or indemnified against or the failure of a customer to meet its indemnification obligations to us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, we may be unable to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable. Incurring a liability for which we are not fully insured or indemnified could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry in which price competition could reduce our profitability.\nWe encounter substantial competition from other drilling contractors. The competition in the markets in which we operate has intensified as recent mergers among E&P companies have reduced the number of available customers and the downturn in oil prices has decreased demand for drilling rigs and resulted in downward pricing pressure on operating drilling rigs.\nAs a result of competition, we may lose market share or be unable to maintain or increase prices for our present services or to acquire additional business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the failure to maintain an adequate safety record could harm our ability to secure new drilling contracts.\nWe face competition from many competitors with greater resources and greater ability to rapidly respond to changing customer requirements and market conditions.\nWe compete with large national and multi-national companies that have longer operating histories, greater financial, technical and other resources and greater name recognition than we do. Many of our larger competitors are able to offer ancillary products and services with their contract drilling services, and recently, some of our larger competitors have begun integrating and offering contract drilling services in connection with directional drilling and other services that we do not offer. In this regard, large diversified oilfield service companies have begun to market bundled services, including contract drilling services, in the United States. If any of these combined offerings gain acceptance within the United States market, it could place us at a competitive disadvantage that has an adverse impact on our future results of operations and profitability.\nFurthermore, some of our competitors\u2019 greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand industry downturns, compete more effectively on the basis of price and technology, retain skilled rig personnel, and build new rigs or acquire and refurbish existing rigs so as to be able to place rigs into service more quickly than us in periods of high drilling demand.\nNew technology may cause our drilling methods or equipment to become less competitive.\nThe drilling industry is subject to the introduction of new drilling and completion methods and equipment using new technologies, some of which may be subject to patent protection. Changes in technology or improvements in competitors\u2019 equipment could make our equipment less competitive or require significant capital investments to build and maintain a competitive advantage. Further, we may face competitive pressure to design, implement or acquire certain new technologies at a substantial cost. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that may allow them to implement new technologies before we can. If we are unable to implement new and emerging technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth strategy.\nOur current estimated backlog of contract drilling revenue may not ultimately be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our estimated contract drilling backlog for future revenues under term contracts, which we define as contracts with a fixed term of six months or more, was approximately $6.1 million. All of this backlog expires in 2021, which requires us to renew these expiring contracts as well as short term contracts under which a large number of our rigs operate. Although we historically have been successful in obtaining extensions or follow on work for drilling rigs with expiring contracts, in periods of market decline or uncertainty such as the U.S. land contract drilling industry is experiencing, we cannot assure that we will obtain such renewals, or that such renewals will be on terms acceptable to us. Any failure to renew or find follow-on work for our drilling rigs with expiring contracts, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nFixed-term drilling contracts customarily provide for termination at the election of the customer, with an \u201cearly termination payment\u201d to us if a contract is terminated prior to the expiration of the fixed term. Additionally, in certain circumstances, for example, destruction of a drilling rig that is not replaced within a specified period of time, our bankruptcy, or a breach of our contract obligations, the customer may not be obligated to make an early termination payment to us. Additionally, during depressed market conditions, such as those we are currently experiencing, or otherwise, customers may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations or may seek to terminate, renegotiate or fail to honor their contractual obligations. In addition, we may not be able to perform under these contracts due to events beyond our control, and our customers may seek to cancel or negotiate our contracts for various reasons, including those described above. As a result, we may be unable to realize all of our current contract drilling backlog. In addition, the renegotiation or termination of fixed-term contracts without the receipt of early termination payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe participate in a capital intensive business. We may not be able to finance future growth of our operations.\nThe contract drilling industry is capital intensive. Our cash flow from operations and the continued availability of credit are subject to a number of variables, including general economic conditions, conditions in the oil and natural gas market, and more specifically, our rig utilization rates, operating margins and ability to control costs and obtain contracts in a competitive industry. Our cash flow from operations and present borrowing capacity may not be sufficient to fund our anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements. We may from time to time seek additional financing, either in the form of bank borrowings, sales of debt or equity securities or otherwise. To the extent our capital resources and cash flow from operations are at any time insufficient to fund our activities or repay our indebtedness as it becomes due, we will need to raise additional funds through public or private financing or additional borrowings. We may not be able to obtain any such\ncapital resources in the amount or at the time when needed. Based upon the significant downturn in market conditions, any new sources of debt capital would require substantially higher interest requirements, and any new sources of equity capital could be substantially dilutive to existing shareholders. Any limitations on our access to capital or increase in the cost of that capital could significantly impair our growth strategy. Our ability to maintain our targeted credit profile could affect our cost of capital as well as our ability to execute our growth strategy. In addition, a variety of factors beyond our control could impact the availability or cost of capital, including domestic or international economic conditions, increases in key benchmark interest rates and/or credit spreads, the adoption of new or amended banking or capital market laws or regulations, the re-pricing of market risks and volatility in capital and financial markets. If we are at any time not able to obtain the necessary capital resources, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe depend on a limited number of vendors, some of which are thinly capitalized and the loss of any of which could disrupt our operations.\nOur contract drilling operations depend upon the availability of various rig equipment, including VFD drives and drillers cabins, top drives, mud pumps, engines and drill pipe, as well as replacement parts, related rig equipment and fuel. Some of these have been in short supply from time to time. In addition, key rig components critical to the operation, construction or upgrade of our rigs are either purchased from or fabricated by a limited number of vendors, including vendors that may compete against us from time to time. For many of these products and services, there are only a limited number of vendors and suppliers available to us.\nWe do not currently have any long-term supply contracts with any of our suppliers or subcontractors and may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our larger competitors when purchasing from these suppliers and subcontractors. Shortages could occur in these essential components due to an interruption of supply or increased demands in the industry. If we are unable to procure certain of such rig components or services from our subcontractors we would be required to reduce or delay our rig construction and other operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth strategy.\nWe could be adversely affected if shortages of equipment or supplies occur.\nIncreased or decreased demand among drilling contractors and our customers for consumable supplies, including fuel, water and ancillary rig equipment, such as pumps, valves, drill pipe and engines, may lead to delays in obtaining these materials and our inability to operate our rigs in an efficient manner. We have periodically experienced increased lead times in purchasing ancillary equipment for our drilling rigs. To the extent there are significant delays in being able to purchase important components for our rigs, certain of our rigs may not be available for operation or may not be able to operate as efficiently as expected, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, our customers typically purchase the fuel and water for their operations, including fuel that runs our drilling rigs, and thus bear the financial impact of increased prices. However, prolonged shortages in the availability of fuel or water to conduct drilling and completion activities could result in the suspension of our contracts or reduce demand for our contract drilling services and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to use our existing net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes could be limited.\nUtilization of any NOL carryforwards depends on many factors, including our ability to generate future taxable income, which cannot be assured. In addition, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cSection 382\u201d), generally imposes, upon the occurrence of an ownership change (discussed below), an annual limitation on the amount of our pre-ownership change NOLs we can utilize to offset our taxable income in any taxable year (or portion thereof) ending after such ownership change. The limitation is generally equal to the value of our stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate. In general, an ownership change occurs if there is a cumulative increase in our ownership of more than 50 percentage points by one or more \u201c5% shareholders\u201d (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) at any time during a rolling three-year period. In addition, future ownership changes or future regulatory changes could further limit our ability to utilize our NOLs. Currently, because we have not yet generated taxable income for federal income tax purposes, all of our NOL assets have been reserved on our balance sheet. However, if all or a substantial part of our NOLs were to be lost or limited, it could still result in our recognizing a net deferred tax liability and associated expense during the period of limitation. In addition, to the extent we are not able to offset our future income with our NOLs, this could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows once we attain profitability.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells that may reduce demand for our activities and could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nHydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injection of water, sand, and certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations or ordinances restricting or increasing the costs of hydraulic fracturing could potentially increase our costs of operations and cause a decrease in drilling activity levels in the Permian Basin and other unconventional resource plays and an associated decrease in demand for our rigs and service, any or all of which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and natural gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas, including from the developing shale plays, incurred by our customers or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing in the unconventional resource plays where we focus our operations. Any such regulation that adversely affects our customers\u2019 operations could materially impact demand for our contract drilling services which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nLegal proceedings could have a negative impact on our business.\nThe nature of our business makes us susceptible to legal proceedings and governmental investigations from time to time. Lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any litigation or claims, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future.\nRegulatory compliance costs and restrictions, as well as any delays in obtaining permits by our customers for their operations, could impair our business.\nThe operations of our customers are subject to or impacted by a wide array of regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result of changes in regulations and laws relating to the oil and natural gas industry, including land drilling, our customers\u2019 operations could be disrupted or curtailed by governmental authorities. In most states, our customers are required to obtain permits from one or more governmental agencies in order to perform drilling and completion activities. Such permits are typically required by state agencies, but can also be required by federal and local governmental agencies. The requirements for such permits vary depending on the location where such drilling and completion activities will be conducted. As with all governmental permitting processes, there is a degree of uncertainty as to whether a permit will be granted, the time it will take for a permit to be issued, and the conditions which may be imposed in connection with the granting of the permit. Additionally, the high cost of compliance with applicable regulations may cause customers to discontinue or limit their operations or defer planned drilling, and may discourage companies from continuing development activities. As a result, demand for our services could be substantially affected by regulations adversely impacting the oil and natural gas industry.\nWe are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant liabilities for penalties, damages or costs of remediation or compliance.\nOur operations are subject to federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of natural resources and the environment, health and safety aspects of our operations and waste management, including the transportation and disposal of waste and other materials. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations on our operations, including the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities, the incurrence of capital expenditures to mitigate or prevent releases of materials from our facilities, the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations and the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in investigations, restrictions or orders suspending well operations, the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the revocation of permits and the issuance of corrective action orders, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThere is inherent risk of environmental costs and liabilities in our business as a result of our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and oilfield and industrial wastes, air emissions and wastewater discharges related to our operations, and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Some environmental laws and regulations may impose strict, joint and several liability, which means that in some situations, we could be exposed to liability as a result of our conduct that was without fault or lawful at the time it occurred or as a result of the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other\nthird parties. Clean-up costs and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws and costs associated with changes in environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLaws protecting the environment generally have become more stringent over time and are expected to continue to do so, which could lead to material increases in costs for future environmental compliance and remediation. The modification or interpretation of existing laws or regulations, or the adoption of new laws or regulations, could curtail exploratory or developmental drilling for oil and natural gas, could limit well servicing opportunities or impose unforeseen liabilities. We may not be able to recover some or any of our costs of compliance with these laws and regulations from insurance.\nPotential listing of species as \u201cendangered\u201d under the federal ESA could result in increased costs and new operating restrictions or delays on our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers, which could adversely reduce the amount of contract drilling services that we provide to such customers.\nThe federal ESA and analogous state laws regulate a variety of activities, including oil and natural gas development, which could have an adverse effect on species listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA or their habitats. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species or the designation of previously unprotected areas as a critical habitat could cause oil and natural gas exploration and production operators to incur additional costs or become subject to operating delays, restrictions or bans in affected areas, which impacts could adversely reduce the amount of drilling activities in affected areas, including support services that we provide to such operators under our contract drilling services segment. Numerous species have been listed or proposed for protected status in areas in which we provide or could in the future provide field services. For instance, the sage grouse, the lesser prairie-chicken and certain wildflower species, among others, are species that have been or are being considered for protected status under the ESA and whose range can coincide with our oil and natural gas production activities. The presence of protected species in areas where operators for whom we provide contract drilling services conduct exploration and production operations could impair such operators\u2019 ability to timely complete well drilling and development and, consequently, adversely affect the amount of contract drilling or other field services that we provide to such operators, which reduction of services could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting or regulating emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our field services.\nIn response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases from industrial and energy sources contribute to increases of carbon dioxide levels in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and oceans and contribute to global warming and other environmental effects, the EPA has adopted various regulations under the federal Clean Air Act addressing emissions of greenhouse gases that may affect the oil and natural gas industry. During 2012, the EPA published rules that include standards to reduce methane emissions associated with oil and natural gas production. In May 2016, the EPA finalized regulations that set methane emission standards for new and modified oil and natural gas facilities, including production facilities. However, in September 2020, the EPA issued a final rule that removed the transmission and storage segment from the 2016 new source performance standards, rescinded VOCs and methane emissions standards for the transmission and storage segment, and rescinded methane emissions standards for the production and processing segments. Various states and industry and environmental groups are separately challenging the EPA\u2019s 2016 standards and its September 2020 final rule. Notwithstanding the current court challenges, on January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order directing the EPA to consider publishing for notice and comment a proposed rule suspending, revising, or rescinding the September 2020 rule, which could result in more stringent methane emission rulemaking. In addition, the United States has been involved in international negotiations regarding greenhouse gas reductions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and was among the 195 nations that signed an international accord in December 2015 with the objective of limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The Paris Agreement (adopted at the conference) went into effect on November 4, 2016. While the U.S. withdrew from the Paris Agreement on November 4, 2020, President Biden issued an executive order on January 20, 2021 recommitting the United States to the Paris Agreement. And, on January 27, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order directing the Secretary of the Interior to pause approval of new oil and natural gas leases on federal lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices and to consider whether to adjust royalties associated with oil and gas resources extracted from public lands and offshore waters to account for corresponding climate costs. Additionally, certain U.S. states and regional coalitions of states have adopted measures regulating or limiting greenhouse gases from certain sources or have adopted policies seeking to reduce overall emissions of greenhouse gases. The adoption and implementation of any international treaty or of any federal or state legislation or regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to comply with such requirements and possibly require the reduction or limitation of emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations and other sources within the industrial or energy sectors. Such legislation or regulations could adversely affect demand for the production of oil and natural gas and thus reduce demand for the services we\nprovide to oil and natural gas producers as well as increase our operating costs by requiring additional costs to operate and maintain equipment and facilities, install emissions controls, acquire allowances or pay taxes and fees relating to emissions, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases may produce changes in climate or weather, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events, which if any such effects were to occur, could have adverse physical effects on our operations, physical assets and field services to exploration and production operators.\nRisks Related to Our Liquidity\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under applicable debt instruments, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance indebtedness depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the interest or principal, when due, on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In the absence of sufficient cash flows and capital resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet debt service and other obligations. Our credit facility currently restricts our ability to dispose of assets and our use of the proceeds from such disposition subject to certain defined exceptions. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions, and the proceeds of any such disposition may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet scheduled debt service obligations.\nRestrictions in our existing and future debt agreements could limit our growth and our ability to engage in certain activities.\nOur existing debt instruments contain a number of significant covenants, including restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022make loans to others;\n\u2022make investments;\n\u2022merge or consolidate with another entity;\n\u2022transfer, lease or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022make certain payments;\n\u2022create or incur liens;\n\u2022purchase, hold or acquire capital stock or certain other types of securities;\n\u2022pay cash dividends;\n\u2022enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022engage in certain other transactions without the prior consent of the lenders.\nA breach of any covenant in any of our debt instruments would result in a default. A resulting event of default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of the payment of the indebtedness outstanding under, and a termination of, these debt instruments. The accelerated indebtedness would become immediately due and payable. If that occurs, we may not be able to make all of the required payments or borrow sufficient funds to refinance such indebtedness. Even if new financing were available at that time, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us.\nThe borrowing base under our revolving credit facility may decline during 2021.\nAt December 31, 2020, the borrowing base under our ABL Credit Facility was $7.7 million, and we had $7.5 million of availability remaining of our $40.0 million commitment on that date. The borrowing base under the ABL Credit Facility is calculated based upon 85% of the sum of our eligible accounts receivable. In most circumstances, all of accounts receivable are considered eligible unless they are more than 90 days past due. If at any time our borrowing base falls below our outstanding balance under our ABL Credit Facility, and we were not able to promptly repay such deficiency, we would be required to repay\nto the banks any deficiency amount. In such event, if our available cash balances were not sufficient to repay such amounts, we would be required to obtain other debt or equity financing necessary to cure such deficiency, and there can be no assurance that such additional financing sources would be available to us, or available on terms acceptable to us. Any inability to timely cure any deficiency between our borrowing base and credit facility balance may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nA failure of any of our lenders to honor commitments or advance funds under our existing debt instruments would have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our operations and business strategy.\nOur ABL Credit Facility limits the amounts we can borrow up to a borrowing base amount which is calculated monthly and is based on a percentage of our eligible accounts receivable. The borrowing base under our ABL Credit Facility was $7.7 million as of December 31, 2020, with lender commitments of $40.0 million. Our Term Loan Facility also contains a committed accordion feature that allows us to borrow up to an additional $15 million during the term of that facility.\nIf our lenders fail to honor their commitments or advance funds pursuant to such commitments, we may be unable to implement our strategic plans, make acquisitions or capital expenditures or otherwise carry out business plans, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to comply with the financial covenants contained in our debt instruments is based upon our future cash flows and debt levels.\nBoth our existing ABL Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility contain a springing financial covenant requiring us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio (\"FCCR\") of 1.0 to 1.0. The FCCR is equal to adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures divided by cash interest expense plus scheduled principal payments, cash dividends and finance lease obligations plus cash taxes paid. This covenant is only tested when excess availability under our ABL Credit Facility falls below 10% of the loan commitment.\nIn addition, our existing Term Loan Facility contains a minimum liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain at all times at least $10 million of liquidity, which can be comprised of cash plus availability under our ABL Credit Facility and Term Loan Accordion.\nOur compliance with each of these covenants depends significantly upon our level of cash flows, which are based upon factors such as future dayrates and rig utilization that are difficult to predict based upon the cyclical nature of our industry. If we are not able to comply with the covenants contained in our debt facilities, we would be required to seek a waiver or amendment to the facility, or seek alternative financing sources, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain such waivers, amendments or alternative financing sources. Any failure to comply with the financial covenants contained in our credit facility, or to cure any such non-compliance may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely affect our business.\nOur business and operating results can be harmed by factors such as the availability, terms of and cost of capital, increases in interest rates or a reduction in credit rating. Our debt carries a floating rate of interest linked to various indices, including LIBOR. A change in indices, including the announced discontinuation of LIBOR, resulting in interest rate increases on our debt could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results. These changes could cause our cost of doing business to increase, limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities, reduce cash flow used for capital expenditures and place us at a competitive disadvantage. For example, total long-term debt at December 31, 2020 included $130.0 million of floating-rate debt attributed to borrowings at an average interest rate of 9.00%, and the impact on annual cash flow of a 10% change in the floating-rate (approximately 0.9%) would be approximately $1.2 million annually based on the floating-rate debt and other obligations outstanding at December 31, 2020; however, there are no assurances that possible rate changes would be limited to such amounts. A significant reduction in cash flows from operations or the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our desired growth and operating results.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nBecause we have no plans to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future, investors must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in us.\nWe have not paid cash dividends on our common stock since our incorporation, and our credit facility prohibits us from paying cash dividends on our common stock. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to support our operations and growth. Accordingly, investors must rely on\nsales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nProvisions in our organizational documents and under Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company at a premium that a stockholder may consider favorable, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nThe existence of some provisions in our organizational documents and under Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company that a stockholder may consider favorable, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock. The provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws that could delay or prevent an unsolicited change in control of our company include:\n\u2022provisions regulating the ability of our stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters for action at annual meetings of our stockholders;\n\u2022limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting and act by written consent; and\n\u2022the authorization given to our Board of Directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock.\nFuture offerings of debt securities, which would rank senior to our common stock in the event of our liquidation, and future offerings of equity securities, which would dilute our existing stockholders or rank senior to our common stock, may adversely affect the market value of our common stock.\nWe intend to evaluate and may attempt to increase our capital resources by offering debt or equity securities, including commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes, convertible notes and classes of preferred stock. In the event of our liquidation, holders of our debt securities and preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. On November 11, 2020, we entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the \u201cCommitment Purchase Agreement\u201d) and a Registration Rights Agreement (the \u201cRegistration Rights Agreement\u201d) with Tumim Stone Capital LLC (\u201cTumim\u201d). Pursuant to the Commitment Purchase Agreement, the Company has the right to sell to Tumim up to $5,000,000 (the \u201cTotal Commitment\u201d) in shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the \u201cShares\u201d) (subject to certain conditions and limitations) from time to time during the term of the Commitment Purchase Agreement. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the market value of our common stock, or both. Our preferred stock, if issued, could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments that would limit amounts available for distribution to holders of our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common stock bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market value of our common stock and diluting their shareholdings in us.\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board of Directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nMSD Capital, L.P. and MSD Partners, L.P. (the \u201cMSD Parties\u201d) currently own a large percentage of the Company\u2019s common stock and have significant influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval; such stockholders\u2019 priorities for the Company\u2019s business may be different from the Company\u2019s others stockholders.\nThe MSD Parties collectively held approximately 15% of the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock as of February 19, 2021. Although the MSD Parties agreed in a stockholders\u2019 agreement to certain limits on their voting in connection with the election of directors, these limitations will terminate on October 1, 2021 and do not apply to most other matters that may be submitted by the Company or third parties for stockholder approval. Accordingly, the MSD Parties may be able to significantly influence the outcome of many corporate transactions or other matters submitted to the Company stockholders for approval, including any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets or any other significant corporate transaction, such that the MSD Parties could potentially delay or prevent a change of control of the Company, even if such a change of control would benefit the Company\u2019s other stockholders. The interests of the MSD Parties may differ from the interests of other stockholders.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related economic repercussions have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and depending on the duration of the pandemic and its effect on the oil and gas industry, could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe worldwide outbreak of COVID-19, the uncertainty regarding the impact of COVID-19 and various governmental actions taken to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, have resulted in a decline in demand for oil and natural gas. To the extent that the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to negatively impact demand and OPEC members and other oil exporting nations fail to continue production cuts or other actions that support and stabilize commodity prices, we expect our business, operating results and financial condition to remain depressed with further declines in activity levels possible.\nGiven the nature and significance of the COVID-19 pandemic on demand for oil, and the uncertainty regarding the length of this impact, our business is subject to substantial risks outside of our control, which include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022disruption to our supply chain for equipment, supplies and materials essential to our business;\n\u2022notices from customers or suppliers arguing that their non-performance under our contracts with them is permitted as a result of force majeure or other reasons;\n\u2022reductions in our borrowing base under our revolving line of credit related to delayed customer payments and payment defaults associated with customer liquidity issues and bankruptcies;\n\u2022a need to preserve liquidity, which could result in reductions or delays to planned maintenance capital expenditures or failure to pursue other business opportunities;\n\u2022failure of our lenders under our revolving credit facility or term loan to honor commitments to provide additional funding in accordance with the terms of such agreements;\n\u2022actions by the lenders under our revolving credit facility that additional borrowings will not be permitted as a result of the occurrence of a material adverse effect caused by the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022actions by the lenders under our term loan or revolving line of credit that additional borrowings permitted under such arrangements will not be permitted as a result of the occurrence of a material adverse effect caused by the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022our ability to comply with minimum liquidity and springing fixed charge coverage ratio covenants contained in our credit facilities;\n\u2022cybersecurity issues, as digital technologies may become more vulnerable and experience a higher rate of cyberattacks in the current environment of remote connectivity;\n\u2022litigation risk and possible loss contingencies related to COVID-19 and its impact, including with respect to commercial contracts, employee matters and insurance arrangements;\n\u2022additional reductions to our workforce to adjust to market conditions, including severance payments, retention issues, and an inability to hire employees when market conditions improve;\n\u2022additional asset impairments, including an impairment of the carrying value of our assets as demand for our contract drilling services decreases;\n\u2022infections and quarantining of our employees and the personnel of our customers, suppliers and other third parties in areas in which we operate; and\n\u2022changes in the regulation of the production of hydrocarbons, such as the imposition of limitations on the production of oil and gas by states in our target markets or other jurisdictions, that may result in additional limits on demand for our contract drilling services.\nIf any of these risk factors were to come to fruition, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our customers delay paying or fail to pay a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nIn most cases, we bill our customers for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our customers delaying or failing to pay our invoices. In weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers\u2019 cash flow from operations and their access to the credit markets. If our customers delay paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe effects of severe weather could adversely affect our operations.\nChanges in climate due to global warming trends could adversely affect our operations by limiting, or increasing the costs associated with, equipment or product supplies. In addition, coastal flooding and adverse weather conditions such as increased frequency and/or severity of hurricanes could impair our ability to operate in affected regions of the country. Oil and natural gas operations of our customers located in Louisiana and parts of Texas may be adversely affected by hurricanes and tropical storms, resulting in reduced demand for our services. Repercussions of severe weather conditions may include: curtailment of services; weather-related damage to facilities and equipment; suspension of operations; inability to deliver equipment, personnel and products to job sites in accordance with contract schedules; and loss of productivity. These constraints could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs. Unusually warm winters also adversely affect the demand for our services by decreasing the demand for natural gas.\nOur business is subject to cybersecurity risks and threats.\nThreats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow. It is possible that our business, financial and other systems could be compromised, which might not be noticed for some period of time. Risks associated with these threats include, among other things, loss of intellectual property, disruption of our customers\u2019 business operations and safety procedures, loss or damage to our worksite data delivery systems, and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.\nAny future implementation of price controls on oil and natural gas would affect our operations.\nCertain groups have asserted efforts to have the United States Congress impose some form of price controls on either oil, natural gas, or both. There is no way at this time to know what results these efforts may have. However, any future limits on the price of oil or natural gas, and resulting impacts on drilling activities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nImprovements in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSince our business depends on the level of drilling activity in the oil and natural gas industry, any improvement in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely impacted by work stoppages or other labor maters.\nWe depend on skilled employees to build and operate our rigs, and any prolonged labor disruption involving our employees could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition by disrupting our ability to perform drilling-related services for our customers. Moreover, unionization efforts have been made from time to time within our industry, with varying degrees of success. Any such unionization could increase our costs or limit our flexibility.\nWe depend on the services of key executives, the loss of whom could materially harm our business.\nOur senior executives are important to our success because they are instrumental in setting our strategic direction, operating our business and technology, identifying, recruiting and training key personnel, and identifying customers and expansion opportunities. We also depend on the relationships that our senior management have with many of our customers. Losing the services of any of these individuals could adversely affect our business until a suitable replacement could be found. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our senior executives. As a result, we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees.\nFailure to hire and retain skilled personnel could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to be productive and profitable depends upon our ability to employ and retain skilled personnel, and we cannot assure that at times of high demand we will be able to retain, recruit and train an adequate number of skilled workers. In addition, our ability to expand our operations will depend in part on our ability to increase the size of our skilled labor force. Potential inability or lack of desire by workers to commute to our facilities and job sites and competition for workers from competitors or other industries are factors that could affect our ability to attract and retain workers. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers or other industries could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force, increases in the wage rates that we must pay, or both. If either or both of these events were to occur, our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired. Our inability to attract and retain skilled workers in sufficient numbers\nto satisfy our existing service contracts and enter into new contracts could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth strategy.", "PERMNO": 14852, "SIC": 1381, "TIC": "ICD"}
