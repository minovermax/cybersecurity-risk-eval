RISK FACTORS.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nBecause we have a limited operating history to evaluate our company, the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered by an early-stage company.\nSince we have a limited operating history in our current business of patent licensing and monetization, it will make it difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate our business and prospects. You must consider our prospects in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties we face as an early stage company with a limited operating history. Investors should evaluate an investment in our company in light of the uncertainties encountered by early-stage companies in an intensely competitive industry and in which the potential licenses and/or defendants from which the Company seeks to obtain recoveries are largely well capitalized companies with resources (financial and otherwise) significantly greater than the Company\u2019s. There can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that we will be able to become profitable.\nWe continue to incur operating losses and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.\nWe have incurred losses from operations in prior years, including 2014 and 2013. Our net loss for the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was $30.5 million and $18.0 million, respectively. Our accumulated deficit was $83.8 million at December 31, 2014 and $53.3 million at December 31, 2013. We may not achieve profitable operations.\nOur assessment, testing and evaluation of the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting resulted in our conclusion that, as of December 31, 2014, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective, due to the Company\u2019s lack of segregation of duties, and lack of controls in place to ensure that all material transactions and developments impacting the financial statements are reflected. We can provide no assurance as to conclusions of management with respect to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in the future.\nWe expect to need additional capital to fund our growing operations, and if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital we may be forced to limit the scope of our operations.\nWe expect that as our business continues to grow we will need additional working capital. If adequate additional debt and/or equity financing is not available on reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to continue to expand our business, and we will have to modify our business plans accordingly. These factors would have a material and adverse effect on our future operating results and our financial condition.\nIf we reach a point where we are unable to raise needed additional funds to continue as a going concern, we will be forced to cease our activities and dissolve the Company. In such an event, we will need to satisfy various creditors and other claimants, severance, lease termination and other dissolution-related obligations and we may not have sufficient funds to pay to our stockholders.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which may hinder our ability to obtain future financing.\nIn their reports for each of our last two fiscal years, our independent registered public accountants stated that our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were prepared assuming that we would continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern, which may hinder our ability to obtain future financing, is an issue raised as a result of recurring losses from operations. We continue to experience net operating losses. Our ability to continue as a going concern is subject to our ability to generate a profit and/or obtain necessary funding from outside sources, including obtaining additional funding from the sale of our securities, increasing sales or obtaining loans from various financial institutions where possible. Our continued net operating losses increase the difficulty in meeting such goals and there can be no assurances that such methods will prove successful.\nThe focus of our business is to monetize intellectual property, including through licensing and enforcement. We may not be able to successfully monetize the patents which we acquire and thus may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of such acquisition.\nWe acquired our patents and patent applications during 2013 in three transactions which significantly changed the focus of our business and operations. We currently own several hundred patent assets and although we may seek to commercialize and develop products, alone or with others, there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully commercialize or develop products and such commercialization and development is not a core focus of our business. There is significant risk involved in connection with our activities in which we acquire and seek to monetize the patent portfolios that we acquired from Rockstar and North South. Our new business is commonly referred to as an NPE model (or \u201cnon-practicing entity\u201d) since we do not currently commercialize or develop products under the recently acquired patents. As an entity, we have limited prior experience as an NPE. The acquisition of the patents and an NPE business model could fail to produce anticipated benefits, or could have other adverse effects that we do not currently foresee. Failure to successfully monetize our patent assets or to operate an NPE business may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the acquisition of patent portfolios is subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u00b7\nThere is a significant time lag between acquiring a patent portfolio and recognizing revenue from those patent assets. During that time lag, material costs are likely to be incurred that would have a negative effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position; and\n\u00b7\nThe integration of a patent portfolio will be a time consuming and expensive process that may disrupt our operations. If our integration efforts are not successful, our results of operations could be harmed. In addition, we may not achieve anticipated synergies or other benefits from such acquisition.\nTherefore, there is no assurance that the monetization of the patent portfolios we acquire will be successful, will occur timely or in a timeframe that is capable of prediction or will generate enough revenue to recoup our investment.\nWe presently are reliant exclusively on the patent assets we acquired from North South and Rockstar. If we are unable to commercialize, license or otherwise monetize such assets and generate revenue and profit through those assets or by other means, there is a significant risk that our business will fail.\nIf our efforts to generate revenue from our patent portfolios acquired from Rockstar and North South fail, we will have incurred significant losses. We may not seek and may be unable to acquire additional assets and therefore may be wholly reliant on our present portfolios for revenue. If we are unable to generate revenue from our current assets and fail to acquire any additional assets, our business will likely fail.\nIn connection with our business, we may commence legal proceedings against certain companies whose size and resources could be substantially greater than ours; we expect such litigation to be time-consuming, lengthy and costly which may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to survive or operate our business, even if the patents are valid and the cases we bring have merit.\nTo license or otherwise monetize our patent assets, we may be required to commence legal proceedings against certain large and well established and well capitalized companies. For instance, we are currently involved in litigation against Cisco Systems, Uniden, VTech Telecommunications, T-Mobile, Verizon Services, Huawei and Juniper Networks, each of whom is much larger and more well capitalized than we are. We may allege that such companies infringe on one or more of our patents. Our viability could be highly dependent on the outcome of this litigation, and there is a risk that we may be unable to achieve the results we desire from such litigation. The defendants in litigation brought by us are likely to be much larger than us and have substantially more resources than we do, which would make success of our litigation efforts subject to factors other than the validity of our patents or infringement claims asserted. The inability to successfully enforce our patents against larger more well-capitalized companies could result in realization through settlement or election to not pursue certain infringers, or less value from our patents, and could result in substantially lower than anticipated revenue realized from infringements and lower settlement values.\nWe anticipate that legal proceedings against infringers of our patents may continue for several years and may require significant expenditures for legal fees and other expenses. Disputes regarding the assertion of patents and other intellectual property rights are highly complex and technical. In addition, courts and the laws are constantly changing in a manner that could increase our fees and expenses for pursuing infringers, and also could result in our assumption of legal fees of defendants if we are unsuccessful. Once initiated, we may be forced to litigate against others to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights. The defendants or other third parties involved in the lawsuits in which we are involved may allege defenses and/or file counterclaims in an effort to avoid or limit liability and damages for patent infringement. Potential defendants could challenge our patents and our actions by commencing lawsuits seeking declaratory judgments declaring our patents invalid, not infringed, or for improper or unlawful activities. If such defenses or counterclaims are successful, they may preclude our ability to obtain damages for infringement or derive licensing revenue from the patents. A negative outcome of any such litigation, or one or more claims contained within any such litigation, could materially and adversely impact our business. Additionally, we anticipate that our legal fees and other expenses will be material and will negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations and may result in our inability to continue our business.\nParties who are alleged infringers of our patent rights may also challenge the validity of our patents in proceedings before the United States Patent and Trademark Office. These potential proceedings include ex parte reexaminations, inter partes review, or covered business method patent challenges. These proceedings could result in certain of our patent claims being invalidated. We would expend signification legal fees to defend against such actions.\nWe have been the subject of litigation and, due to the nature of our business, may be the target of future legal proceedings that could have an adverse effect on our business and our ability to monetize our patents.\nOn January 17, 2014, an action was filed by several cable operators in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (No. 1:99-mc-09999) against Rockstar, Bockstar Technologies LLC, Constellation Technologies LLC and the Company (collectively, the \u201cDefendants\u201d). The complaint (the \u201cComplaint\u201d) was filed by Charter Communications, Inc., WideOpenWest Finance, LLC a/k/a WOW! Internet Cable & Phone, Knology, Inc., Cequel Communications, LLC d/b/a Suddenlink Communications and Cable one, Inc. (\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d).\nOn June 11, 2014, the Company and the Plaintiffs filed a joint stipulation of dismissal in the action filed on January 17, 2014. As a result, the Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations against the Company are dismissed without prejudice, with each party to bear its own costs. The Plaintiffs and the Company also agreed, with respect to all patents owned by the Company as of the date of the filing, to negotiate in good faith prior to bringing any action concerning these patents or bringing an action for infringement of these patents. The parties agreed that any further actions related to these patents will be brought solely in Delaware.\nThe Company may become subject to similar actions in the future which will be costly and time consuming to defend, the outcome of which are uncertain.\nWe may seek to internally develop additional new inventions and intellectual property, which would take time and be costly. Moreover, the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights for such inventions would lead to the loss of our investments in such activities.\nPart of our business may include the internal development of new inventions or intellectual property that we will seek to monetize. However, this aspect of our business would likely require significant capital and would take time to achieve. Such activities could also distract our management team from its present business initiatives, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business. There is also the risk that our initiatives in this regard would not yield any viable new inventions or technology, which would lead to a loss of our investments in time and resources in such activities.\nIn addition, even if we are able to internally develop new inventions, in order for those inventions to be viable and to compete effectively, we would need to develop and maintain, and we would heavily rely upon, a proprietary position with respect to such inventions and intellectual property. However, there are significant risks associated with any such intellectual property we may develop principally including the following:\n\u00b7\npatent applications we may file may not result in issued patents or may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents;\n\u00b7\nwe may be subject to interference proceedings;\n\u00b7\nwe may be subject to opposition proceedings in the U.S. or foreign countries;\n\u00b7\nany patents that are issued to us may not provide meaningful protection;\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u00b7\nother companies may challenge patents issued to us;\n\u00b7\nother companies may have independently developed and/or patented (or may in the future independently develop and patent) similar or alternative technologies, or duplicate our technologies;\n\u00b7\nother companies may design around technologies we have developed; and\n\u00b7\nenforcement of our patents could be complex, uncertain and very expensive.\nWe cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any future applications, or that any of our patents, once issued, will provide us with adequate protection from competing products. For example, issued patents may be circumvented or challenged, declared invalid or unenforceable, or narrowed in scope. In addition, since publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we will be the first to make our additional new inventions or to file patent applications covering those inventions. It is also possible that others may have or may obtain issued patents that could prevent us from commercializing our products or require us to obtain licenses requiring the payment of significant fees or royalties in order to enable us to conduct our business. As to those patents that we may license or otherwise monetize, our rights will depend on maintaining our obligations to the licensor under the applicable license agreement, and we may be unable to do so. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights for our inventions would lead to the loss our business.\nMoreover, patent application delays could cause delays in recognizing revenue from our internally generated patents and could cause us to miss opportunities to license patents before other competing technologies are developed or introduced into the market.\nNew legislation, regulations or court rulings related to enforcing patents could harm our new line of business and operating results.\nIf Congress, the United States Patent and Trademark Office or courts implement new legislation, regulations or rulings that impact the patent enforcement process or the rights of patent holders, these changes could negatively affect our business. For example, limitations on the ability to bring patent enforcement claims, limitations on potential liability for patent infringement, lower evidentiary standards for invalidating patents, increases in the cost to resolve patent disputes and other similar developments could negatively affect our ability to assert our patent or other intellectual property rights.\nOn September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the \u201cLeahy-Smith Act\u201d), was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law. These changes include provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The U.S. Patent Office has been developing regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act recently became effective. Accordingly, it is too early to tell what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOn June 4, 2013, the Obama Administration issued executive orders and legislative recommendations. The legislative measures recommended by the Obama Administration include requiring patentees and patent applicants to disclose the \u201cReal Party-in-Interest\u201d, giving district courts more discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party, requiring public filing of demand letters such that they are accessible to the public, and protecting consumers against liability for a product being used off-the shelf and solely for its intended use.\nThe executive orders require the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the \u201cUSPTO\u201d) to make rules to require the disclosure of the Real Party-in-Interest by requiring patent applicants and owners to regularly update ownership information when they are involved in proceedings before the USPTO (e.g. specifying the \u201cultimate parent entity\u201d) and requiring the USPTO to train its examiners to better scrutinize functional claims to prevent allowing overly broad claims.\nOn December 5, 2013, the United States House of Representatives passed a patent reform titled the \u201cInnovation Act\u201d by a vote of 325-91. Representative Bob Goodlatte, with bipartisan support, introduced the Innovation Act on October 23, 2013. The Innovation Act, as passed by the House, has a number of major changes. Some of the changes include a heightened pleading requirement for the filing of patent infringement claims. It requires a particularized statement with detailed specificity regarding how each asserted claim term corresponds to the functionality of each accused instrumentality. The Innovation Act, as passed by the House, also includes fee-shifting provisions which provide that, unless the non-prevailing party of a patent infringement litigation positions were objectively reasonable, such non-prevailing party would have to pay the attorney\u2019s fees of the prevailing party.\nThe Innovation Act also calls for discovery to be limited until after claim construction. The patent infringement plaintiff must also disclose anyone with a financial interest in either the asserted patent or the patentee and must disclose the ultimate parent entity. When a manufacturer and its customers are sued at the same time, the suit against the customer would be stayed as long as the customer agrees to be bound by the results of the case.\nRepresentative Goodlatte reintroduced the Innovation Act as H.R. 9 on February 2, 2015. The bill has 19 co-sponsors, made up of 10 Democrats and 9 Republicans. On February 5, 2015, the bill was referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary for further consideration, and on March 17, 2015, the bill was referred to the House Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet.\nOn November 18, 2013, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), with bipartisan support, introduced the Patent Transparency and Improvements Act of 2013 (the \u201cTransparency Act\u201d) in the United States Senate. The Transparency Act had many provisions that were similar to the provisions of the Innovation Act. On May 21, 2014, Senator Leahy issued a statement that he was removing the patent bill from the Senate Judiciary Committee agenda because there is not sufficient support. Senator Leahy noted further that if the stakeholders are able to reach a more targeted agreement that focuses on the problem of patent trolls, there will be a path for passage this year and that he would bring such a bill immediately to the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nOn April 29, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court relaxed the standard for fee shifting in patent infringement cases. Section 285 of the Patent Act provides that attorneys\u2019 fees may be awarded to a prevailing party in a patent infringement case in \u201cexceptional cases.\u201d\nIn Octane Fitness, LLC v. Icon Health & Fitness, Inc., the Supreme Court overturned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit decisions limiting the meaning of \u201cexceptional cases.\u201d The U.S. Supreme Court held that an exceptional case \u201cis simply one that stands out from others with respect to the substantive strength of a party\u2019s litigation position\u201d or \u201cthe unreasonable manner in which the case was litigated.\u201d The U.S. Supreme Court also rejected the \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard for making this inquiry. The Court held that the standard should be a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence.\u201d\nIn Highmark Inc. v. Allcare Health Mgmt. Sys., Inc., the U.S. Supreme Court held that a district court\u2019s grant of attorneys\u2019 fees is reviewable by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit only for \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d by the district court instead of the de novo standard that gave no deference to the district court.\nThese pair of decisions lowered the threshold for obtaining attorneys\u2019 fees in patent infringement cases and increased the level of deference given to a district court\u2019s fee-shifting determination.\nThese two cases will make it much easier for district courts to shift a prevailing party\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees to a non-prevailing party if the district court believes that the case was weak or conducted in an abusive manner. Defendants that get sued for patent infringement by non-practicing entities may elect to fight rather than settle the case because these U.S. Supreme Court decisions make it much easier for defendants to get attorneys\u2019 fees.\nOn June 19, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International in which the Court addressed the question of whether patents related to software are patent eligible subject matter. The Supreme Court did not rule that patents related to software were per se invalid or that software-related inventions were unpatentable. The Supreme Court outlined a test that the courts and the USPTO must apply in determining whether software-related inventions qualify as patent eligible subject matter. We must now wait and see how the federal district courts and the USPTO will apply this ruling. The test outlined by the Supreme Court could potentially affect the value of some of the patents we hold.\nOn January 20, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court decided another patent case, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc. In Teva, the Court overturned the long-standing practice that claim construction decision made by district courts were given de novo review on appeal. Instead, the Supreme Court held that when claim construction is based on extrinsic evidence, a district court\u2019s findings of subsidiary facts are to be reviewed for clear error, while its ultimate claim construction is to be reviewed de novo. This change in how claim construction decisions are reviewed on appeal may have an impact on how parties handle patent litigation in the district courts. This could increase our litigation expenses. The full impact of the Teva decision on patent litigation at the district court level is yet to be determined.\nIt is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed, or whether any of the proposals will become enacted as laws in their current or modified forms. Compliance with any new or existing laws or regulations could be difficult and expensive, affect the manner in which we conduct our business and negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur acquisitions of patent assets may be time consuming, complex and costly, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nAcquisitions of patent or other intellectual property assets, which are critical to our business plan, are often time consuming, complex and costly to consummate. We may elect to not pursue any additional patents while we focus our efforts on monetizing our existing assets. We may utilize many different transaction structures in our acquisitions and the terms of such acquisition agreements tend to be heavily negotiated. As a result, we expect to incur significant operating expenses and will likely be required to raise capital during the negotiations even if the acquisition is ultimately not consummated, or if we determine to acquire additional patents or other assets. Even if we are able to acquire particular patent assets, there is no guarantee that we will generate sufficient revenue related to those patent assets to offset the acquisition costs. While we will seek to conduct confirmatory due diligence on the patent assets we are considering for acquisition, we may acquire patent assets from a seller who does not have complete analysis of infringements or claims, have proper title or ownership to those assets, or otherwise provides us with flawed ownership rights, including invalid or unenforceable assets. In those cases, we may be required to spend significant resources to defend our interest in the patent assets and, if we are not successful, our acquisition may be worthless, in which case we could lose part or all of our investment in the assets.\nWe may also identify patent or other intellectual property assets that cost more than we are prepared to spend with our own capital resources. We may incur significant costs to organize and negotiate a structured acquisition that does not ultimately result in an acquisition of any patent assets or, if consummated, proves to be unprofitable for us. Acquisitions involving issuance of our securities could be dilutive to existing stockholders and could be at prices lower than those prices reflected in the trading markets. These higher costs could adversely affect our operating results and, if we incur losses, the value of our securities will decline.\nIn addition, we may acquire patents and technologies that are in the early stages of adoption. Demand for some of these technologies will likely be untested and may be subject to fluctuation based upon the rate at which our licensees or others adopt our patents and technologies in their products and services. As a result, there can be no assurance as to whether technologies we acquire or develop will have value that can be realized through licensing or other activities.\nWe have ongoing financial obligations to certain stockholders under the terms of our acquisition of certain patents from Rockstar. Our failure to comply with our obligations to these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the value of our assets, our financial performance and our ability to sustain operations.\nIn connection with our agreement to acquire Rockstar patents entered on December 31, 2013, the Company and Rockstar entered into a series of agreements which require us to redeem $20 million of stated value of Series I Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock in $5 million increments on each of the 6, 12, 18 and 24 months anniversary of the purchase. While as of March 23, 2015 we have redeemed $14.1 million of these shares, we presently have inadequate cash to fund the remaining payments. In the event that such payments are not timely made, the holders of our Series I Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock may employ certain remedies, including the imposition of interest at a rate of 15% per annum from the closing date on unpaid and unconverted amounts due and after the 12 month anniversary can reduce the redemption obligations through sale or recovery of patents in the acquisition at a value equal to unconverted amounts due which have been pledged as collateral for such obligations. Rockstar has filed a UCC-1 covering our redemption obligations and has the right to foreclose on the collateral. The redemption obligation is also required to be satisfied in the event that we engage in certain capital raising transactions (among other instances, where such transactions result in net proceeds to us in excess of $7.5 million) and from recoveries on other assets. The obligation to utilize capital from financings and from other sources or the loss of patents to Rockstar upon a default could adversely impact our liquidity and financial position.\nDuring the quarter ended June 30, 2014, we redeemed 84,219 shares of Series I Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock. In accordance with this redemption, we paid Rockstar $14.1 million. This payment fully satisfied the redemption payments that were due on June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2014 and satisfied $4.1 million of the $5.0 million redemption payment due on June 30, 2015. In January 2015, Rockstar transferred its remaining outstanding Series I Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock to an affiliate of RPX Corporation.\nIn addition, Rockstar will be entitled to receive a contingent recovery percentage of future profits from licensing, settlements and judgments against defendants with respect to patents purchased by us from Rockstar. In particular, once we recover a certain amount of proceeds pertaining to the patents acquired from Rockstar in June 2013, which amount will not exceed $8.0 million, net of certain expenses, we will be required to make a payment of up to $13.0 million to Rockstar within six months of such recovery. Furthermore, once we recover a certain level of proceeds pertaining to each portfolio of patents we acquired from Rockstar, we will be required to make participation payments to Rockstar which, depending on how much we recover, could range from 30% of the amount we recover to 70% of the amount we recover in any given quarter, net of certain expenses. Our ability to fund these payments will depend on the liquidity of our assets, recoveries, alternative demands for cash resources and access to capital at the time. Furthermore, our obligation to fund these payments could materially adversely impact our liquidity and financial position.\nIn certain acquisitions of patent assets, we may seek to defer payment or finance a portion of the acquisition price. This approach may put us at a competitive disadvantage and could result in harm to our business.\nWe have limited capital and may seek to negotiate acquisitions of patent or other intellectual property assets where we can defer payments, finance a portion of the acquisition price or have an obligation to make contingent payments upon recovery of value from those assets. These types of debt financing, deferred payment or contingent arrangements may not be as attractive to sellers of patent assets as receiving the full purchase price for those assets in cash at the closing of the acquisition, and, as a result, we might not compete effectively against other companies in the market for acquiring patent assets, many of whom have greater cash resources than we have. We may also finance our activities by issuance of debt which could require interest and amortization payments which we may not have the ability to repay, in which case we could be in default under the terms of loan agreements. We may pledge our assets as collateral and if we are in default under our agreements, we could lose our assets through foreclosure or similar processes or become insolvent or bankrupt in which case investors could lose their entire investment.\nAny failure to maintain or protect our patent assets or other intellectual property rights could significantly impair our return on investment from such assets and harm our brand, our business and our operating results.\nOur ability to operate our new line of business and compete in the intellectual property market largely depends on the superiority, uniqueness and value of our acquired patent assets and other intellectual property. To protect our proprietary rights, we will rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties, and protective contractual provisions. No assurances can be given that any of the measures we undertake to protect and maintain our assets will have any measure of success.\nWe will be required to spend significant time and resources to maintain the effectiveness of our assets by paying maintenance fees and making filings with the USPTO. We may acquire patent assets, including patent applications, which require us to spend resources to prosecute the applications with the USPTO prior to issuance of patents. Further, there is a material risk that patent related claims (such as, for example, infringement claims (and/or claims for indemnification resulting therefrom), unenforceability claims, or invalidity claims) will be asserted or prosecuted against us, and such assertions or prosecutions could materially and adversely affect our business. Regardless of whether any such claims are valid or can be successfully asserted, defending such claims could cause us to incur significant costs and could divert resources away from our other activities.\nDespite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, any of the following or similar occurrences may reduce the value of our intellectual property:\n\u00b7\nour applications for patents, trademarks and copyrights may not be granted and, if granted, may be challenged or invalidated;\n\u00b7\nissued trademarks, copyrights, or patents may not provide us with any competitive advantages when compared to potentially infringing other properties;\n\u00b7\nour efforts to protect our intellectual property rights may not be effective in preventing misappropriation of our technology; or\n\u00b7\nour efforts may not prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to or competitive with, or superior to those we acquire and/or prosecute.\nMoreover, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in certain foreign countries where we may do business or enforce our patents against infringers in foreign countries. If we fail to maintain, defend or prosecute our patent assets properly, the value of those assets would be reduced or eliminated, and our business would be harmed.\nWeak global economic conditions may cause infringing parties to delay entering into licensing agreements, which could prolong our litigation and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nOur business plan depends significantly on worldwide economic conditions, and the United States and world economies have recently experienced weak economic conditions. Uncertainty about global economic conditions poses a risk as businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and declines in income or asset values. This response could have a material negative effect on the willingness of parties infringing on our assets to enter into licensing or other revenue generating agreements voluntarily. Entering into such agreements is critical to our business plan, and our failure to do so could cause material harm to our business.\nIf we are not able to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use, it could diminish the value of our products and services, weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue.\nOur success depends in large part on our intellectual property ownership. In addition, we believe that our trade secrets and non-patented technology may be key to identifying and differentiating our products and services from those of our competitors. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, the value of our products and services could be diminished and our competitive position may suffer.\nWe rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Third-parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our property without authorization or develop similar information and property independently, which may infringe upon our proprietary rights. We may not be able to detect infringement and may lose competitive position in the market before we do so, including situations which may damage our ability to succeed in licensing negotiations or legal proceedings such as patent infringement cases we may bring. In addition, competitors may design around our technologies or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property protection may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries.\nIf we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights, the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive. In addition, our proprietary rights could be at risk if we are unsuccessful in, or cannot afford to pursue, those proceedings, or that contingent fees could be a significant portion of our recovery. We will also rely on trade secrets and contract law to protect some of our proprietary technology. We will enter into confidentiality and invention agreements with inventors, employees and consultants and common interest agreements with parties associated with our litigation efforts. Nevertheless, these agreements may not be honored and they may not effectively protect our right to our privileged, confidential or proprietary information or our patented or un-patented trade secrets and know-how. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and know-how.\nWe face evolving regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure that may result in additional expenses and continuing uncertainty.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, SEC regulations and NASDAQ Stock Market LLC rules are creating uncertainty for public companies. We are presently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to new and proposed rules and cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur or the timing of these costs. These new or changed laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest the resources necessary to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, due to ambiguities related to practice or otherwise, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, which could be costly and time-consuming, and our reputation and business may be harmed.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud and our business may be harmed and our stock price may be adversely impacted.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports or to prevent fraud could harm our business. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management to evaluate and assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In order to continue to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to continuously evaluate and, where appropriate, enhance our policies, procedures and internal controls. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting, we could be subject to litigation or regulatory scrutiny and investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports. We cannot assure you that in the future we will be able to fully comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or that management will conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. If we fail to fully comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our business may be harmed and our stock price may decline.\nOur assessment, testing and evaluation of the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting resulted in our conclusion that, as of December 31, 2013, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective, due to the Company\u2019s lack of segregation of duties, and difficulty in applying complex accounting principles, including fair value of derivatives, options and warrants as well as stock based compensation accounting. We can provide no assurance as to conclusions of management with respect to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in the future.\nWith respect to the year ended December 31, 2014, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon this evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2014.\nIf we make acquisitions, it could divert management\u2019s attention, cause ownership dilution to our shareholders and be difficult to integrate.\nFollowing our acquisition of North South in September 2013, we have grown rapidly and we expect to continue to evaluate and consider future acquisitions. Acquisitions generally involve significant risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the assets, services and technologies we acquire or industry overlay on which the patent assets read, diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, overvaluation of the acquired assets, and the acceptance of the acquired assets and/or claims. Acquisitions may not be successful, which can have a number of adverse effects upon us including adverse financial effects and may seriously disrupt our management\u2019s time. The integration of acquired assets may place a significant burden on management and our internal resources. The diversion of management attention and any difficulties encountered in the integration process could harm our business.\nIf we fail to manage our existing assets and patent inventory and third party relationships (such as attorneys and experts) effectively, our revenue and profits could decline and should we fail to acquire additional revenues from license fees, our growth could be impeded.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to manage our existing portfolios of patent assets and manage our third party relationships necessary to monetize our assets effectively. Our attorneys and experts are not bound by long-term contracts that ensure us a consistent access to expertise necessary to enforce our patents, which is crucial to our ability to generate license revenues and prosecute infringers. In addition, attorneys and experts can change the cost of the services they provide, such as contingent fees that we are required to pay, and our arrangements often required an increasing percentage of recoveries to be devoted to attorney\u2019s fees depending on the length of time or stage of the case prior to settlement or recovery, reducing the residual amount available to us following conclusion of a case. If an attorney, seller, inventor or expert decides not to provide needed assistance in connection with a case, or provides assistance to prospective licensees or defendants, we may not be able to timely replace this expertise with that from other sources or prevent such assistance to others from damaging our claims and prospects for recovery or licensing thus resulting in potentially lost cases, opportunities, or revenues and potentially diminishing the value of our patent assets. The ability to utilize attorneys, sellers\u2019 personnel, inventors or experts will depend on various factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur common stock may be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market if we fail to comply with continued listing standards.\nOur common stock is currently traded on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol \u201cSPEX.\u201d If we fail to meet any of the continued listing standards of The NASDAQ Capital Market, our common stock could be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market. These continued listing standards include specifically enumerated criteria, such as:\n\u00b7\na $1.00 minimum closing bid price;\n\u00b7\nstockholders\u2019 equity of $2.5 million;\n\u00b7\n500,000 shares of publicly-held common stock with a market value of at least $1 million;\n\u00b7\n300 round-lot stockholders; and\n\u00b7\ncompliance with NASDAQ\u2019s corporate governance requirements, as well as additional or more stringent criteria that may be applied in the exercise of NASDAQ\u2019s discretionary authority.\nOver the past several years, including at certain times prior to entering into our new line of business, we had several instances of NASDAQ deficiencies.\nOn April 20, 2012, the Company received a deficiency notice from NASDAQ regarding the bid price of our common stock. Following a 1 for 20 reverse stock split, on October 8, 2012, NASDAQ provided confirmation to us that we regained compliance with Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2) since the closing bid price of its common stock had traded at $1.00 per share or greater for at least ten (10) consecutive business days. This was the second time the Company employed a reverse stock split to avoid NASDAQ delisting.\nOn September 25, 2012, the Company received written notification from NASDAQ advising that the minimum number of publicly held shares of our common stock had fallen below the minimum 500,000 shares required for continued listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market pursuant to NASDAQ Rule 5550(a)(4). As a result of our November 2012 private placement transaction, the Company was advised by NASDAQ that it regained compliance with Rule 5550(a)(4).\nOn December 31, 2012, our total stockholders\u2019 equity was $854,000, and was below the $2.5 million listing standard required by NASDAQ. In March 2013, we exchanged warrants issued in November 2012 for Series C Preferred Stock, effectively increasing total stockholders\u2019 equity to approximately $2.8 million.\nOn March 24, 2015, we received a deficiency notice from NASDAQ that the bid price of our common stock no longer met NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements. In order to regain compliance with the NASDAQ listing rules, our common stock will need to have a closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for at least 10 consecutive trading days no later than September 21, 2015.\nIf we fail to comply with NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing standards, we may be delisted and our common stock will trade, if at all, only on the over-the-counter market, such as the OTC Bulletin Board or OTCQX market, and then only if one or more registered broker-dealer market makers comply with quotation requirements. In addition, delisting of our common stock could depress our stock price, substantially limit liquidity of our common stock and materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nFinally, delisting of our common stock could result in our common stock becoming a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under the Securities Exchange Act. The principal result or effect of being designated a \u201cpenny stock\u201d is that securities broker-dealers cannot recommend the shares but must trade it on an unsolicited basis. Penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC, which specifies information about penny stocks and the nature and significance of risks of the penny stock market. A broker-dealer must also provide the customer with bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and sales person in the transaction, and monthly account statements indicating the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for shares that become subject to those penny stock rules.\nOur share price may be volatile and there may not be an active trading market for our common stock.\nThere can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will not decline below its present market price or that there will be an active trading market for our common stock. The market prices of technology or technology related companies have been and are likely to continue to be highly volatile. Fluctuations in our operating results and general market conditions for technology or technology related stocks could have a significant impact on the volatility of our common stock price. We have experienced significant volatility in the price of our common stock. From January 1, 2012 through March 27, 2015, the share price of our common stock (on a split-adjusted basis) has ranged from a high of $27.86 to a low of $0.78. The reason for the volatility in our stock is not well understood and may continue. Factors that may have contributed to such volatility include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7\ndevelopments regarding regulatory filings;\n\u00b7\nour funding requirements and the terms of our financing arrangements;\n\u00b7\ntechnological innovations;\n\u00b7\nintroduction of new technologies by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nmaterial changes in existing litigation;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the enforceability or other matters surrounding our patent portfolios;\n\u00b7\ngovernment regulations and laws;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments in patent or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7\nthe number of shares issued and outstanding;\n\u00b7\nthe number of shares trading on an average trading day;\n\u00b7\nperformance of companies in the non-performing entity space generally;\n\u00b7\nannouncements regarding other participants in the technology and technology related industries, including our competitors;\n\u00b7\nblock sales of our shares by stockholders to whom we have sold stock in private placements, or the cessation of transfer restrictions with respect to those shares; and\n\u00b7\nmarket speculation regarding any of the foregoing.\nWe could fail in future financing efforts or be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market if we fail to receive stockholder approval when needed.\nWe are required under the NASDAQ rules to obtain stockholder approval for any issuance of additional equity securities that would comprise more than 20% of the total shares of our common stock outstanding before the issuance of such securities sold at a discount to the greater of book or market value in an offering that is not deemed to be a \u201cpublic offering\u201d by NASDAQ. Funding of our operations and acquisitions of assets may require issuance of additional equity securities that would comprise more than 20% of the total shares of our common stock outstanding, but we might not be successful in obtaining the required stockholder approval for such an issuance. If we are unable to obtain financing due to stockholder approval difficulties, such failure may have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations.\nDividends on our common stock are not likely.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Investors must look solely to the potential for appreciation in the market price of the shares of our common stock to obtain a return on their investment.\nBecause of the Rights Agreement and \u201cAnti-Takeover\u201d provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, a third party may be discouraged from making a takeover offer that could be beneficial to our stockholders.\nEffective as of January 24, 2013, we adopted a shareholder rights plan. The effect of this rights plan and of certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws, and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us, purchasing a significant portion of our stock or replacing members of our Board of Directors, or make more costly any attempt to acquire control of the Company, even if the acquisition or the Board designees would be beneficial to our stockholders. These factors could also reduce the price that certain investors might be willing to pay for shares of the common stock and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions.\nIn addition, defendants in actions seeking to enforce our patents may seek to influence our Board of Directors and stockholders by acquiring positions in the Company to force consideration of settlement or licensing proposals that may be less desirable than other outcomes such as litigation with respect to our monetization or patent enforcement activities. The effect of such influences on our Company or our corporate governance could reduce the value of our monetization activities and have an adverse effect on the value of our assets. The effect of anti-takeover provisions could impact the ability of prospective major stockholders (which may include parties adverse to us in our litigations) to obtain influence in the Company or representation on the Board of Directors or acquire a significant ownership position and such result may have an adverse effect on the Company and the value of its securities.\nFurthermore, in the event we consummate certain fundamental transactions, we are required to redeem such portion of the outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock as shall equal (i) 50% of the net proceeds of the fundamental transaction after deduction of the amount of net proceeds required to leave us with cash and cash equivalents on hand of $5.0 million and up until the net proceeds leave us with cash and cash equivalents on hand of $7.5 million and (ii) 100% of the net proceeds of the fundamental transaction thereafter. For these purposes, a fundamental transaction includes, among other things, the realization by us of net proceeds from any financing, recovery, sale, license fee or other revenue received by the Company (including on account of any intellectual property rights held by us and not just in respect of the patents) during any fiscal quarter in an amount which would cause our cash or cash equivalents to exceed $5,000,000. Thus, a significant portion of any amount we raise in a financing transaction or generate from monetization of our intellectual property may need to be used to redeem all or a portion of our Series I Preferred Stock rather than being used to finance our operations. This may also discourage third parties from entering into fundamental transactions with us that do not result in a complete change in control.\nWe may be unable to issue securities under our shelf registration statement, which may have an adverse effect on our liquidity.\nWe have filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC. The registration statement, which has been declared effective, was filed in reliance on Instruction I.B.6. of Form S-3, which imposes a limitation on the maximum amount of securities that we may sell pursuant to the registration statement during any twelve-month period. At the time we sell securities pursuant to the registration statement, the amount of securities to be sold plus the amount of any securities we have sold during the prior twelve months in reliance on Instruction I.B.6. may not exceed one-third of the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates as of a day during the 60 days immediately preceding such sale as computed in accordance with Instruction I.B.6. Based on this calculation and primarily as a result of our sale of $20,000,000 of Series J Preferred Stock on May 29, 2014, we are not currently eligible to sell any securities pursuant to our effective registration statement on Form S-3. We expect to be able to sell securities pursuant to our shelf registration statement starting on May 30, 2015, the maximum amount of which will be based on the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates as of a day during the 60 days preceding that date (or any subsequent date on which we sell securities) minus $225,000, representing the value attributed to 125,000 shares of our common stock that we issued in reliance on Instruction I.B.6. of Form S-3 on July 10, 2014. Whether we sell securities under the registration statement will depend on a number of factors, including the market conditions at that time, our cash position at that time and the availability and terms of alternative sources of capital. If we cannot sell securities under our shelf registration, we may be required to utilize more costly and time-consuming means of accessing the capital markets, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity and cash position.\nIf we cannot manage our growth effectively, we may not establish or maintain profitability.\nBusinesses which grow rapidly often have difficulty managing their growth. If our business continues to grow as rapidly as we anticipate, we will need to expand our management by recruiting and employing experienced executives and key employees capable of providing the necessary support.\nWe cannot assure you that our management will be able to manage our growth effectively or successfully. Our failure to meet these challenges could cause us to continue to lose money, which will reduce our stock price.\nIt may be difficult to predict our financial performance because our quarterly operating results may fluctuate.\nOur revenues, operating results and valuations of certain assets and liabilities may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. You should not rely on period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Our results of operations may fall below the expectations of market analysts and our own forecasts. If this happens, the market price of our common stock may fall significantly. The factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include the following:\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in results of our enforcement and licensing activities or outcome of cases;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in duration of judicial processes and time to completion of cases;\n\u00b7\nthe timing and amount of expenses incurred to negotiate with licensees, litigate cases and obtain settlements from infringers;\n\u00b7\nthe impact of our anticipated need for personnel and expected substantial increase in headcount;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in the receptiveness of courts and juries to significant damages awards in patent infringement cases and speed to trial in the jurisdictions in which our cases may be brought and the accepted royalty rates attributable to damages analysis for patent cases generally, including the royalty rates for industry standard patents which we may own or acquire;\n\u00b7\nworsening economic conditions which cause revenues or profits attributable to infringer sales of products or services to decline;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the regulatory environment, including regulation of NPE activities or patenting practices, that may negatively impact our or infringers practices;\n\u00b7\nthe timing and amount of expenses associated with litigation, regulatory investigations or restructuring activities, including settlement costs and regulatory penalties assessed related to government enforcement actions;\n\u00b7\nAny changes we make in our Critical Accounting Estimates described in the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections of our periodic reports;\n\u00b7\nthe adoption of new accounting pronouncements, or new interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements, that impact the manner in which we account for, measure or disclose our results of operations, financial position or other financial measures; and\n\u00b7\ncosts related to acquisitions of technologies or businesses.\nIf we fail to retain our key personnel, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business could suffer.\nOur future depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and the continued contributions of our executive officers, each of whom may be difficult to replace. In particular, Anthony Hayes, our Chief Executive Officer, is important to the management of our business and operations and the development of our strategic direction. The loss of the services of any such individual and the process to replace any key personnel would involve significant time and expense and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.\nCertain of our stockholders may have actual or potential interests that may depart from those of our other stockholders.\nThe interests of certain of our stockholders may differ from the interests of other stockholders. For example, in January 2015, Rockstar transferred their remaining holdings of our shares to an affiliate of RPX Corporation, whose primary business is to reduce patent-related risk and expense, including to reduce the costs associated with defending intellectual property rights from NPEs such as the Company and whose clients may include entities to whom we are adverse in patent enforcement litigation. There can be no assurance that our significant stockholders will, in future matters submitted for stockholder approval, vote in favor of such matter, even if such matters are recommended for approval by management or are in the best interest of stockholders, generally. As a result, in addition to their positions with us, such persons will have the ability to vote their significant holdings in favor of proposals presented to our stockholders for approval, including proposals to:\n\u00b7\nelect or defeat the election of our directors;\n\u00b7\namend or prevent amendment of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws;\n\u00b7\neffect or prevent a merger, sale of assets or other corporate transaction; and\n\u00b7\ncontrol the outcome of any other matter submitted to the shareholders for vote.\nIn addition, such holder\u2019s stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price. Our significant stockholders could also utilize their significant ownership interest to seek to influence management and decisions of the Company, or to dispose of our shares in a manner that creates downward pressure on our stock price, which in turn may make it more difficult for us to raise capital or meet NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing standards.\nBecause an increasing amount of our outstanding shares may become freely tradable, sales of these shares could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is performing well.\nAs of March 27, 2015, we had 28,611,967 outstanding shares of common stock, of which our directors and executive officers own 23,368 shares which are subject to the limitations of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Of these shares, 10,000,000 represent shares of common stock issued upon the conversion of the Series J Preferred Stock on June 2, 2014, which shares were issued in an offering registered under the Securities Act and are generally freely tradable.\nIn general, Rule 144 provides that any non-affiliate of ours, who has held restricted common stock for at least six-months, is entitled to sell their restricted stock freely, provided that we are then current in our filings with the SEC.\nAn affiliate of the Company may sell after six months with the following restrictions:\n\u00b7\nwe are current in our filings,\n\u00b7\ncertain manner of sale provisions,\n\u00b7\nfiling of Form 144, and\n\u00b7\nvolume limitations limiting the sale of shares within any three-month period to a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of 1% of the total number of outstanding shares or, the average weekly trading volume during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice of sale.\nBecause almost all of our outstanding shares are freely tradable (subject to certain restrictions imposed by lockup agreements executed by the holders thereof) and the shares held by our affiliates may be freely sold (subject to the Rule 144 limitations), sales of these shares could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is performing well.", "PERMNO": 18148, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "AIKI"}
