{"cik": "912833", "company": "WEST MARINE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nOur business faces many risks. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks of which we are not yet aware, or that we currently think are immaterial, may also impair our business operations or financial results. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nIf we are not able to respond to trends emerging in the boating industry and attract a more diverse customer base, our revenues and operating results could materially suffer.\nWe have identified mega-trends impacting the boating industry, including:\n\u2022\nRecently, boat sales have improved over prior years; however, boat sales are still well below pre-recession levels, and sales are trending towards boats that are smaller and easier to maintain.\n\u2022\nThe average age of our core customer base ranges from 50 to 54 years old for power boaters and from 55 to 60 years old for sailors.\n\u2022\nWe believe there is increasing competition for our customers' recreational time, and we do not expect a meaningful change in this longer-term trend.\n\u2022\nOmni-channel retailers have higher cost-to-serve models than pure-play eCommerce retailers, putting pressure on margins as competition increases with greater price transparency.\nIntense competition in the boating supplies, apparel and outdoor recreation markets could reduce our revenue and profitability.\nWe face strong competition in the retail market for recreational boating supplies and apparel from multi-channel retailers, internet-based businesses, catalog retailers, traditional marine supply stores, sporting goods stores and mass merchants. We also have a number of competitors serving professional customers in the distribution of marine products. A key competitive factor in the marine supplies market is price. Price transparency and comparability continues to increase, particularly as a result of digital technology, including increased use of smart-phones or other mobile devices which allow customers to compare prices on a real time basis. The retail industry continues to experience a trend towards an increase in sales initiated online and\nincreased use of mobile applications. Some online-only businesses have lower operating costs than omni-channel retailers like us. Because our business strategy is based on offering an exceptional customer experience and a full range of services to complement the products we offer, our cost structure is higher than some of our competitors, and this, in conjunction with price transparency, puts pressure on our margins and such pressures are expected to continue. In addition, some of our competitors have greater financial resources than us and may be able to offer lower prices than us for a sustained period of time or may increase their spending on advertising and promotions relative to our spending. Also, if our advertising and promotions become less effective than those of our competitors, we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If we are unable to remain competitive in the key areas of customer service, the shopping experience for all customers, quality of products, depth of selection or store environment and location, we may lose market share to our competitors and our sales and profitability could suffer.\nOur business is highly seasonal and weather dependent and our results of operations could be adversely affected if unseasonably cold weather, prolonged winter conditions, sustained high winds, natural disasters, such as hurricanes, extraordinary amounts of rainfall, earthquakes or man-made disasters occur, particularly during the peak boating season in our second and third fiscal quarters.\nThe majority of our revenues and profits occur between the months of April and September, which represent the peak boating months in most of our markets. Our results would be materially and adversely affected if our net revenues were to fall below expected seasonal levels during this period. Our store optimization and merchandise expansion strategies include a focus on providing the space and flexibility to appropriately transition products as we enter and exit peak boating season. If we are not able to successfully implement these strategies on an ongoing basis, we will continue to experience net losses in the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year.\nOur business is also significantly affected by weather patterns. Unseasonably cool weather, prolonged winter conditions, sustained high winds, extraordinary amounts of rainfall or natural or man-made disasters may decrease boating use in the peak season, resulting in lower maintenance needs and boat usage and, therefore, decreased revenues.\nOur support center, one of our two distribution centers and our management information systems are located in northern California. If we encounter any disruptions to our operations within these buildings or if they were to shut down for any reason, including fire, earthquake or other natural disaster, we may be delayed or prevented from effectively operating our stores, shipping and processing our products and/or operating our eCommerce websites. Furthermore, the risk of disruption or shut down at these buildings is greater than it might be if they were located in another region, as northern California is prone to natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods and wildfires. Any disruption or shut down at these locations could significantly impact our operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe continue to invest in a number of strategies designed to build our long-term strength. If one or more of these strategies is unsuccessful, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nOver the past few years, we have launched a number of strategies designed to increase sales, lower costs and strengthen our focus on profitability. These strategies include:\n\u2022investing in our eCommerce websites;\n\u2022investing in new and existing stores to improve customers' experiences and introducing new and expanded product categories;\n\u2022\nexpanding our business serving professional customers; and\n\u2022\nimproving the retail experience for our retail and professional customers.\nTo support these growth strategies, we have invested in store development, information technology infrastructure, added key positions to our eCommerce and information technology departments, and made enhancements in marketing to attract a more diverse customer base. If we fail to successfully execute one or more of these strategies, or if positive results from these strategies take longer to realize than originally expected, our profitability in the short and/or long-term could be adversely affected.\nEfforts to increase our gross margin and improve profitability due to changes in customer and product mix may not be successful.\nWe continue to increase our investments in core product merchandise in many markets to support our initiatives to increase sales and profitability. These products generally are sold at higher gross margins and not susceptible to higher seasonal clearance. While we are experiencing increased growth in the sale of core products to retail customers, growth in sales of our merchandise expansion categories is increasing at a more rapid pace, although off a smaller baseline. Our merchandise expansion products are generally sold at lower margins, and some of the products, such as clothing and footwear, are subject to clearance activity as seasonal assortments change. As a result of this product mix shift, we are experiencing gross margin\npressure. If this product mix significantly increases, or our initiatives to increase gross profit are not successful, we will face additional gross margin pressure which could adversely impact our profitability.\nIn addition, in 2016 we restructured certain pricing tiers and other aspects of distribution model servicing our professional customers to offset increased costs and distribution expenses. Because this market is fragmented and highly competitive, we anticipated some sales and market share loss as we worked to improve our gross margins and operational efficiencies. If sales decline and/or we experience market share loss greater than anticipated levels, or if margin gains are not sufficient to offset revenue loss, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe experience fluctuations in our comparable store sales.\nOur comparable store sales have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual and quarterly basis, and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future. A variety of factors affect comparable store sales, including boat usage, boating participation, economic conditions, competition, the timing and release of new merchandise and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of marketing programs and weather conditions. These factors and others may cause our comparable store sales, customer traffic, conversion and average order values to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations. Failure to meet the expectations of investors in one or more future periods could adversely impact the market price of our common stock.\nOur inability to achieve steady, profitable growth would materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nA critical component of our business strategy is to ensure steady growth in profitability. In connection with this strategy, we implemented and continue to refine our key growth strategies designed to broaden our brand with increase product assortment, revitalize our store experience, increase our eCommerce presence and enhance our operational efficiency. For additional information regarding our strategic plan, see Item 1. Business, \"Business Strategies\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. It may take longer than expected, and require increased investments, to execute on our strategies to broaden our brand appeal which could delay or prevent us from achieving profitability or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nDelays in new store openings, unplanned cost overruns, or inability to find suitable sites could materially affect our store optimization strategy and, consequently, our financial performance.\nOur expected financial performance is based on our new, remodeled or expanded stores opening on expected dates and on budget. It is possible that events such as construction delays caused by permitting or licensing issues, material shortages, labor issues, weather delays or other acts of God, discovery of contaminants or accidents could delay planned store openings beyond their expected dates, give rise to cost overruns, or force us to abandon planned openings altogether. Additionally, we may incur cost overruns on projects if we underestimate the scope of work or level of expense required. Any failure on our part to recognize or respond to any of the foregoing issues may adversely affect our revenue growth, which, in turn, may adversely affect our operating results. Additionally, if we are unable to find suitable sites, our financial performance may be adversely impacted.\nOur eCommerce operations subject us to numerous risks that could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe are pursuing a heightened focus on technology to enhance our eCommerce business by broadening the selection of our on-line merchandise offering and improving product search performance. Revenues generated by eCommerce constitute an increasing portion of our overall revenues and subject us to certain risks that could have an adverse effect on our operating results, including: diversion of traffic and sales from our stores; liability for on-line content; and risks related to the computer systems that operate our websites and related support systems, such as computer viruses, electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. Changing regulations and laws governing the Internet and eCommerce transactions (including taxation, user privacy, data protection, pricing and electronic communications) could impede the growth of our eCommerce business and increase our cost of doing business. In addition, other risks beyond our control, such as entry of our vendors in the eCommerce business in competition with us, and on-line security breaches could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we are unable to provide our customers a cost-effective shopping platform that is able to respond and adapt to rapid changes in technology.\nThe number of people who access the Internet through devices other than personal computers, including mobile phones, smartphones, handheld computers such as notebooks and tablets, video game consoles and television set-top devices, has increased dramatically in the past several years. As new mobile devices and platforms are released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing applications for alternative devices and platforms, and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support and maintenance of such applications. If we are unable to attract consumers to our websites through these devices or are slow to develop a version of our websites that is more compatible with alternative\ndevices or a mobile application, we may fail to capture a significant share of consumers using these devices or applications, which could adversely affect our business.\nIf we are not able to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner, our merchandise expansion strategy and our operating results could materially suffer.\nOur merchandise expansion strategy focuses on growing sales in categories that appeal to customers that enjoy recreating on or around the water, not necessarily boat ownership. These categories differ from our core merchandise categories, which are more directly related to owning and caring for a boat, the supply and demand of which typically is based on the frequency and duration of boat usage. This merchandise expansion strategy depends, in large part, on our ability to successfully attract a more diverse waterlife consumer and to introduce new products to all of our customers, as well as the level of consumer acceptance of these strategies. Consumers continue to have a wide variety of choices in terms of how and where they purchase these products. Failure to accurately predict and adapt to constantly changing consumer tastes, preferences, spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions, or to effectively address consumer expectations and concerns, could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and reputation with our customers.\nWe must successfully order and manage our inventory to reflect customer demand in a volatile market and anticipate changing consumer preferences and buying trends or our revenues and profitability will be adversely affected.\nOur success depends upon our ability to successfully manage our inventory and to anticipate and respond to merchandise trends and customer demands in a timely manner. The retail industry, by its nature, is volatile and sensitive to numerous factors, including consumer preferences, competition, market conditions and general economic conditions. None of these factors are within our control. We cannot predict consumer preferences with certainty, and consumer preferences often change over time. We typically order merchandise well in advance of the peak selling season. The extended lead times for many of our purchases make it difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends, increases in customer demand or changes in prices. If we misjudge either the market for our merchandise or our customers\u2019 purchasing habits, our revenues may decline, we may not have sufficient quantities of merchandise to satisfy customer demand or we may be required to mark down excess inventory, any of which would result in lower profit margins.\nIf any of our manufacturers, key vendors or third-party service providers fail to supply us with merchandise or services, we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers or our business needs, and our sales could decline.\nWe depend on merchandise purchased from our vendors, services provided by third parties, and merchandise sourced from third-party manufacturers to obtain products and services for our sales channels. Generally, we deal with our merchandise suppliers on an order-by-order basis and have limited long-term purchase contracts or other contractual assurances of continued supply or pricing. Accordingly, our vendors and manufacturers could discontinue selling products to us at any time. The loss of any key vendor or manufacturer for any reason could limit our ability to offer products that our customers want to purchase. In addition, we believe many of our vendors obtain their products from China, Taiwan, Korea, Mexico and other countries, and we source products from third-party manufacturers in these countries. A vendor could discontinue selling products manufactured in foreign countries to us at any time for reasons that may or may not be within our or the vendor\u2019s control, including foreign government regulations, political unrest, war, disruption or delays in shipments, changes in local economic conditions, quotas, quality control, increased costs for raw materials, and trade issues. Also, there is a risk that certain of our vendors or third party service providers may experience financial difficulty resulting in inability to provide service or manufacture or deliver products or services to us in a timely manner. Additionally, changes in commercial practices of our key vendors or manufacturers, such as changes in vendor support and incentives, changes in credit or payment terms or inability or failure of our service providers to provide required services, could negatively impact our operating results. Our operating results also could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a vendor, manufacturer or service provider who is unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with a vendor, manufacturer or service provider providing equally appealing products or services.\nOur results of operations could materially deteriorate if we fail to attract, develop and retain qualified associates or if we lose key management.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified associates, including general managers, assistant managers, eCommerce associates and store associates, who understand retail, appreciate boating and water-related activities, and the varied product lines we carry, and are able to communicate knowledgeably with our customers. Qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and in the numbers needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas. Historically, turnover rates in the retail industry are high in comparison to other industries. In particular, the relatively rural location of our support center in Watsonville, California, has on occasion limited our ability to attract and recruit candidates with required background and experience in the retail, information technology and eCommerce fields.\nAdditionally, competition for qualified associates could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of associates. An inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay the planned\nopenings of new stores. Any such delays, any material increases in associate turnover rates or any increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nAlso, if we are unable to hire and retain associates capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service, as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture and knowledge of our merchandise, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Although none of our associates currently are covered by collective bargaining agreements, we cannot guarantee that our associates will not elect to be represented by labor unions in the future, which could increase our labor costs.\nOur performance also depends largely on the efforts and ability of our senior management. We do not maintain any key-man life insurance for our senior management, including Matthew Hyde, our President and Chief Executive Officer. If we do not effectively implement our strategic and business planning processes to attract, retain, train and develop future leaders, our business may suffer. We rely on the experience of our senior management, who have specific knowledge relating to us and our industry that is difficult to replace. If unexpected leadership turnover occurs, the loss of the services of these individuals could negatively impact our ability to be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our growth objectives.\nA natural disaster or other disruption at our support center or either of our distribution centers could cause us to lose merchandise or inhibit our ability to process orders and, therefore, make us unable to effectively deliver to our customers and retail stores.\nWe rely on the continuous operation of our support center in Watsonville, California, and our distribution centers in Hollister, California, and Rock Hill, South Carolina. Any natural disaster or other serious disruption to these operations due to fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, terrorism or any other unforeseen circumstance could materially impair our ability to do business and adversely affect our financial position and future operating results.\nAny failure to amend or extend our line of credit could have an adverse material effect on our future operating results.\nOur current loan and security agreement expires in November 2017. We are in the process of negotiating and amending the current loan and security agreement; however, if we fail to amend the current line of credit or are unable to secure a line of credit from another bank, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nEconomic conditions in the U.S. and key international markets or other conditions leading to a decline in consumer discretionary spending may materially and adversely impact our operating results.\nWe sell products and services that consumers tend to view as discretionary items rather than necessities. As a result, our results of operations tend to be more sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending. Other factors, including consumer confidence, employment levels, interest rates, tax rates, consumer debt levels, consumers' ability to obtain credit, as well as fuel and energy costs, could reduce consumer spending or change consumer purchasing habits. In the recent past, many of these factors adversely affected consumer spending and, consequently, our business and results of operations. A slowdown in the U.S. or global economy, continued economic and financial instability in Europe or an uncertain economic outlook could materially and adversely affect consumer spending habits and our operating results in the future. Legislative changes, including those related to trade and import taxes, could have an adverse impact on our results.\nThe domestic and international political climate also affects consumer confidence. The threat or outbreak of domestic or international terrorism, civil unrest or other hostilities could lead to a decrease in consumer spending. Similarly, an overly anti-business climate or sentiment could potentially lead consumers to decrease or shift their spending habits. Any of these events and factors could cause a decrease in revenue or an increase in inventory markdowns or certain operating expenses, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nAny failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our business, customers, associates and vendors, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise, could damage our reputation with customers, associates and vendors, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, including fines and penalties, and to become subject to litigation, and could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe receive certain personal information about our customers, associates and vendors. We also rely on business partners to provide services to us that may include the sharing of important business information or data about our customers, associates and vendors. In addition, our point of sale at stores and online operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. While we maintain security measures to protect and to prevent unauthorized access to such information, it is possible that unauthorized parties (through cyberattacks, which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, or by other means) might compromise our security measures or those of our service providers and obtain the personal information of customers, associates and vendors that we hold or other confidential company data. Such an occurrence could adversely affect our reputation with our customers, associates and vendors, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in\nlitigation against us or the imposition of fines and penalties. Moreover, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures that we employ to guard such important personal information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations. Likewise, with increased cybersecurity attacks in various industries, including the retail sector, we cannot be assured that we will be able to attract and retain sufficient qualified IT security personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel in all industries.\nIn addition, states and the federal government are increasingly enacting laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft. These laws will likely increase the costs of doing business and, if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these new laws, we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies, which could harm our business.\nIf we are unable to implement, maintain and/or upgrade our information systems and software programs or if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner, our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient and our key growth strategies may not be successful.\nWe depend on information systems for many aspects of our business. We rely on certain software vendors to implement, maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that we can continue to support our business. We could be materially adversely affected if our information systems are disrupted or if we are unable to implement, improve, upgrade, maintain and expand systems, particularly in light of our continued focus on our omni-channel business model and growth strategies.\nThe success of our key growth strategies is dependent in varying degrees on the timely delivery and the functionality of information technology systems to support them. Extended delays or cost overruns in securing, developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support our strategic business initiatives would delay and possibly even prevent us from realizing the projected benefits of those initiatives.\nOur success also depends on our ability to anticipate and implement innovations in sales and marketing technology to appeal to existing and potential customers who increasingly rely on multiple portals, including mobile technologies, to meet their shopping needs. Failure to enhance our technology and marketing efforts to align with our customers\u2019 shopping preferences could significantly impair our ability to meet our strategic business and financial goals.\nA significant amount of our common stock is beneficially owned by our founder, Randolph K. Repass, and a limited number of institutional investors, whose interests may differ from that of our other stockholders.\nRandolph K. Repass, our founder and a member of our board of directors, beneficially owns approximately 26% of our common stock. As a result, Mr. Repass has substantial influence in the election of our directors and, in general, the outcome of any matter submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including mergers, consolidations or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. Due to his significant ownership position, Mr. Repass may be able, in concert with others, to prevent or to cause a change in control of West Marine. The interests of Mr. Repass in any matter to be voted on or in any transaction with us may be different than those of other stockholders. Additionally, because of our current common stock price, aggregate market capitalization, the potential market value of our assets and cash position, we may be an attractive target to a buyer or subject to a hostile takeover. Since our stock is concentrated in the hands of Mr. Repass and a limited number of independent stockholders, any of such stockholders could exercise their rights to influence the strategic direction of West Marine to the detriment of our existing plans.\nWe face periodic reviews, audits and investigations by government agencies and independent third parties, and these audits could have adverse findings, which may negatively impact our business.\nWe are subject to various routine and non-routine reviews, audits and investigations by various federal and state governmental regulators, including consumer protection, environmental, tax and customs agencies. Violation of the laws and regulations governing our operations, or changes in interpretations of those laws, could result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties, the suspension or revocation of our licenses, or the revision and recoupment of past payments made based on audit findings. In addition, certain third-party service suppliers have rights under their contracts with us to review and audit our use of their licensed products, and an unfavorable audit could result in adverse and possibly material claim for payment. Many proceedings and audits raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. If we become subject to material fines or other payments due and owing, the cost of defense, or if other sanctions and/or corrective actions are imposed upon us or if we incur significant costs to refute or defend against any such fine, claim or other sanction, our results of operations may be negatively impacted.\nNon-compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (\u201cPCI DSS\u201d) may subject us to fines, penalties and civil liability.\nWe are subject to compliance with PCI DSS, an information security standard for organizations that handle cardholder information from major debit and credit card companies. As PCI DSS standards change, our continued compliance efforts may result in significant expenses and any failure to fully comply with PCI DSS on an ongoing basis may subject us to fines, penalties and civil liability, and, in extreme circumstances, could result in the loss of our ability to accept debit and credit card payments or prohibit us from processing transactions through American Express, MasterCard, VISA and other card and payment networks. Even if we are compliant with PCI DSS or other applicable security standards, we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving customer transaction data.\nOur failure to comply with certain environmental regulations could adversely affect our business.\nWe sell paints, varnishes and other products that are subject to federal and state environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, registration, storage, distribution, transportation, handling and waste management of hazardous materials. Environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve and we may become subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future. Our failure to comply with these regulations could result in injunctions and/or fines and penalties and could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, we have indemnified certain of our landlords for any hazardous waste which may be found on or about our leased properties. If any such hazardous waste were to be found on property that we occupy, a significant claim giving rise to an indemnity obligation could adversely impact our operating results.\nBecause we self-insure against certain risks and maintain high deductibles on certain of our insurance policies, our operating results may be adversely affected if we suffer a substantial casualty.\nWe believe that insurance coverage is prudent for risk management, and we expect that our insurance costs will continue to increase. For certain types or levels of risk, including medical care, we have decided to limit our purchase of relevant insurance, choosing instead to self-insure. This puts us at risk for costs to be unpredictable from period to period and we have experienced significant variances in costs from one quarter to another. With medical insurance, we have individual and aggregate stop loss insurance to protect us from large claims. Additionally, we may incur certain types of losses that we cannot insure or which we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to acts of war, employee and certain other crime, and some natural disasters. For example, we insure our workers\u2019 compensation losses through a high deductible program. This high per-claim deductible permits us to maintain low premium rates but may result in unexpectedly high costs if actual losses greatly exceed the expected losses in a year, with a corresponding negative effect on our operating results.\nIf we suffer a substantial loss that is not covered by commercial insurance, the loss and attendant expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Additionally, unanticipated changes in any applicable actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our recorded liabilities for these losses, including potential increases in medical and indemnity costs, could result in materially different amounts of expense than expected under these programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWith the passage in 2010 of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \"ACA\"), we are required to provide affordable coverage, as defined in the ACA, to all employees, or otherwise be subject to a payment per employee based on the affordability criteria in the ACA. Many of these requirements are currently contemplated to be phased in over a period of time. Additionally, some states and localities have passed state and local laws mandating the provision of certain levels of health benefits by some employers. Increased health care and insurance costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, changes in federal or state workplace regulations could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe have begun to operate a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and participation in a reinsurance program for extended warranties starting in 2017. Our overall business may be adversely affected if the captive insurance is not successful or we incur larger losses than anticipated.\nWith our captive insurance program, there is inherent risk involved and it's the function of West Marine, Inc. to absorb negative loss developments. Specifically, with product warranty programs, future developments regarding the products comprising the program and their attendant loss development remains uncertain. If future loss experience materially deviates from our current estimates, it may have a negative effect on our operating results.\nFailure of our internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). Because\nof its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. The identification of a material weakness could indicate a lack of controls adequate to generate accurate financial statements that, in turn, could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to timely remediate any material weaknesses that may be identified in future periods or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance. Likewise, we cannot assure that we will be able to attract and retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly-traded companies.\nFailure to comply with the SEC\u2019s permanent injunction entered on consent against us could subject us to further SEC enforcement actions, which could adversely affect our business.\nAs previously disclosed, we reached a consensual resolution of the SEC\u2019s civil complaint resulting in a permanent injunction (the \u201cSEC Injunction\u201d) entered on August 31, 2009 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, San Jose Division. In agreeing to the entry of the SEC Injunction, we neither admitted nor denied the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint. The SEC Injunction, by its terms, permanently restrains and enjoins us from, among other things, (1) filing with the SEC any report under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and rules and regulations adopted under the Exchange Act, that contains any untrue statement of a material fact, which omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or that omits any information required to be disclosed, (2) failing to make and keep accurate books, records or accounts which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of assets, and (3) failing to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Our failure to comply with any of the provisions of the SEC Injunction could adversely affect our business as a result of further SEC investigations, enforcement action, and/or criminal prosecution and penalties, which could be significant.\nThe price of our common stock may be subject to volatile fluctuations based on fluctuations in our quarterly results, general economic and market conditions and by our ability to meet market expectations.\nThe market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to operating results, comparable store sales announcements, announcements by competitors, our ability to meet market expectations and other factors. Variations in the market price of our common stock may also be the result of changes in the trading characteristics that prevail in the market for our common stock, including low trading volumes, trading volume fluctuations and other similar factors. These market fluctuations, as well as general economic conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We cannot assure that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future.\nWe might be involved in claims or disputes related to intellectual property that require us to protect our rights or defend against claims of infringement.\nWe take precautionary measures to protect our brand, including registering our various trademarks in the United States and internationally and by relying on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with our associates and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. We do not know whether the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office or corresponding foreign agencies will grant registrations based on our pending trademark applications. Even if registrations are granted to us, our trademark rights may be challenged. It is also possible that our competitors or others will adopt trademarks similar to ours, thus impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to customer confusion. Despite our efforts, the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, and our ability to police such misappropriation or infringement is uncertain, particularly in countries outside of the United States.\nFurthermore, from time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights, copyrights, trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which they believe cover certain products we have developed or purchased for resale, as well as technology and/or services that we use in, or are relevant to, our business. The rate of patent infringement assertions both by operating entities and third party non-practicing entities (sometimes referred to as \"patent trolls\") is increasing.\nWe can be adversely affected by litigation, other proceedings or claims either brought by us to protect our rights or brought against us or against our manufacturers, suppliers or service providers alleging infringement of third party proprietary rights. Intellectual property disputes are often expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct, can be time-consuming, divert the time and attention of our technical and management personnel, and result in costly litigation. Additionally, claims against us, if successful, could require us to: pay substantial damages or royalties; comply with an injunction or other court order that could\nprevent us from offering certain of our products; seek a license for the use of certain intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all; or obtain non-infringing products and/or technology, which could require significant effort and expense and ultimately may not be successful. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of future legal proceedings, claims or investigations. The instigation of legal proceedings or claims, our inability to favorably resolve or settle such proceedings or claims, or the determination of any adverse findings against us in connection with such proceedings or claims could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our business reputation.\nWe face the risk of exposure to product quality issues, product liability claims, product recalls and adverse publicity.\nWe contract to manufacture, market and distribute products purchased from third-party suppliers, including products which are marketed and resold under our private label brands. We may inadvertently resell products that contain a defect that may cause property damage or personal injury to our end-user customers, which therefore exposes us to the risk of adverse publicity, product quality issues, product liability claims, and product recalls or other regulatory or enforcement actions, including those initiated by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, by state regulatory authorities or through private causes of action. We generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our suppliers and we carry our own insurance. However, if the insurance coverage is not provided or adequate and/or the contractual indemnification is not provided by or enforceable against the supplier, product liability claims relating to the quality of or to defective and/or recalled products could have a material adverse effect on our ability to successfully market our products and on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even if a product liability claim is not successful or is not fully pursued, the costs associated with defending such claims and/or the negative publicity surrounding a product recall or any assertion that our products caused property damage or personal injury, could damage our brand identity and our reputation with existing and potential customers and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in, or failure to comply with, laws and regulations could increase our cost of doing business and/or adversely impact the boating industry, and, we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States and the other countries and jurisdictions in which we operate, and changes in the level of government regulation of our business have the potential to materially alter our business practices and/or our profitability. Changes in U.S. or foreign law that change our operating requirements with respect to sourcing or reselling products could increase our costs of compliance or make it too expensive for us to offer such products, which could lead to a reduction in revenue. Also, changing regulations and laws governing the Internet, eCommerce, electronic devices and other services (including taxation, user privacy, data protection, pricing and electronic and mobile communications, environmental regulations and information reporting requirements) could diminish the demand for our products and services, impede the growth of our eCommerce business and increase our cost of doing business. In addition, changes in interpretations of laws or regulations, including interpretations as to what constitutes personally identifiable information, could adversely impact industry practices related to the collection and use of customer information. Any changes we make in the manner in which we collect and/or use such information could add significant costs, expose us to litigation, impact our marketing efforts, impede growth of our customer database and limit our customer-service offerings. Furthermore, changes in federal or state wage requirements (including changes in minimum wage requirements, entitlement programs such as health insurance, paid leave programs, or other changes in workplace regulation) could adversely impact our ability to achieve our financial targets.\nVarious federal and state labor laws govern our relationships with our employees and affect operating costs. These laws include employee classifications as exempt or non-exempt, minimum wage requirements, unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation rates, overtime, family leave, safety standards, payroll taxes, citizenship requirements and other wage and benefit requirements for employees classified as non-exempt. As our associates are paid at rates set above, but related to, the applicable minimum wage, further increases in the minimum wage could increase our labor costs. Significant additional government regulations could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not control our vendors or the manufacturers that produce the products we buy from them, nor do we control the labor practices of our vendors and these manufacturers. The violation of labor by any of our vendors or these manufacturers or the divergence of the labor practices followed by any of our vendors or these manufacturers from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States, could interrupt, or otherwise disrupt, the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation. Additionally, failure to comply with laws and regulations concerning ethical business practices by these vendors or manufacturers, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, certain of our products are subject to regulation and regulatory standards set by various governmental authorities with respect to quality and safety. These regulations and standards may change from time to time. Our inability to comply on a timely basis with regulatory requirements could result in significant fines or penalties, which could adversely affect our reputation and sales. Issues with the quality and safety of merchandise we sell, regardless of our culpability, or\ncustomer concerns about such issues, could result in damage to our reputation, lost sales, uninsured product liability claims or losses, merchandise recalls and increased costs.\nMany of the products we sell are sourced by our vendors and, to a limited extent, by us, in many foreign countries. In addition, we export merchandise to international customers. As a result, we are subject to the various risks of doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad or exporting merchandise to customers abroad, such as: potential disruptions in supply; changes in duties, tariffs, quotas on imported and exported merchandise; strikes and other events affecting delivery; consumer perceptions of the safety of imported merchandise; concerns about human rights, working conditions and other labor rights and conditions in foreign countries where merchandise is produced; disruptions of shipping and international trade caused by natural and man-made disasters; significant delays in the delivery of cargo due to security considerations; and economic and political conditions or terrorist acts, or other problems in countries from or through which merchandise is imported and exported. Although we have policies and procedures to address these deficiencies and to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from, and exporting merchandise abroad, such laws and regulations are highly complex and there can be no assurance that our associates, contractors, agents, vendors or other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies, which could adversely affect our operations or operating results.\nWe are required to disclose the use of 'conflict minerals' in certain of the products we distribute, which imposes costs on us and could raise reputational and other risks.\nThe SEC has promulgated rules in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act regarding disclosure of the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d (which are defined as tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold) that are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. These rules have required, and currently will continue to require, due diligence and the filing of reports annually with the SEC regarding such matters. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs to determine the source and custody of conflict minerals, if any, that are used in the manufacture of our products. We also may face reputational challenges if we are unable to verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products, or if we are unable to conclude that our products are \u201cconflict free.\u201d Over time, conflict minerals reporting requirements may affect the sourcing, price and availability of our products, and may affect the availability and price of conflict minerals that are certified as conflict free, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in accounting standards, interpretations or applications of accounting principles, and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters, could significantly affect our financial results.\nGAAP and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business including, but not limited to, inventory valuation adjustments, capitalized indirect costs, costs associated with exit activities, impairment of long-lived assets, workers\u2019 compensation reserves, and valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance. Additionally, changes in accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, their interpretation and/or their application to our financial statements, particularly in light of the ongoing convergence of GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards, could result in material charges to our financial statements.\nOur business and financial results may be adversely affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory or market responses to such change.\nThe prevailing political and scientific sentiment is that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are influencing global weather patterns. Changing weather patterns, along with the increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions, especially during peak boating season, could reduce boat usage, the sale of our products or materially affect our store locations, which are primarily located in coastal areas, through storm damage, restricted water access from droughts, reduced traffic, or increased insurance rates. Additionally, concern over climate change, including global warming, has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions. For example, proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on greenhouse gas emissions continue to be considered by policy makers which, if adopted, may adversely affect the boating industry and the suppliers of our retail products. Laws enacted may increase production costs for many of our retail products and, therefore, the prices we pay to stock such products may increase. We may not be able to pass along these increased prices to our customers, which could adversely impact our business and financial results.", "PERMNO": 79884, "SIC": 5500, "TIC": "WMAR"}
