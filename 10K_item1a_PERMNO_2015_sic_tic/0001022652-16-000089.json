Before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this report and in the documents incorporated by reference herein and therein. Some of the risks and uncertainties described herein have been grouped so that related risks can be viewed together. You should not draw conclusions regarding the relative magnitude or likelihood of any risk based on the order in which risks or uncertainties are presented herein. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently deem to be material, and do not represent all of the risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider material may in the future become material and impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business could be materially harmed, and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment. You should also refer to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nOur operating results may vary significantly from period to period and may cause our stock price to fluctuate.\nOur future operating results may fluctuate significantly and may fall short of or exceed the expectations of securities analysts, investors or management. If this occurs, the market price of our stock could fluctuate, in some cases materially. The following factors may cause fluctuations in our operating results:\n\u2022\nDecreases in revenue or increases in operating expenses. We budget our operating expenses based on anticipated sales, and a significant portion of our sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative costs are fixed, at least in the short term. If revenue decreases, due to pricing pressures or otherwise, or does not increase as planned and we are unable to reduce our operating costs quickly and sufficiently, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.\n\u2022\nSales mix. Our sales mix affects profit margins in any given period. As our business evolves and the revenue from the sales mix of our product and service offerings varies from period to period, our operating results will likely fluctuate in ways that might not be directly proportionate to the fluctuation in revenue.\n\u2022\nNew product and service introductions. As we introduce new products and services to our mix of offerings, the timing of these introductions within any given period will affect our operating results. We may have difficulty predicting the timing of new product or service introductions and the market acceptance of these new products or services. If products and services are introduced earlier or later than anticipated, or if market acceptance is unexpectedly high or low, our operating results may fluctuate unexpectedly.\n\u2022\nLengthy sales cycle. The length of time between the date of initial contact with a potential customer and the execution of and delivery under a contract may take several months or longer, and is subject to delays or interruptions over which we have little or no control. Sales of our products and services are subject to delays from, among other things, our customers\u2019 budgeting and vendor approval mechanics, and competitive evaluation processes that typically accompany significant purchasing decisions. As a result, our ability to anticipate the timing and volume of sales to specific customers is limited, and the delay or failure to complete one or more large transactions could cause our operating results to vary significantly from period to period.\n\u2022\nForeign currency. We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our attempts to minimize the effects of volatility in foreign currencies on cash flows may not be successful.\nDue to these and other factors, our results of operations may fluctuate substantially in the future and period-to-period comparisons may not be reliable indicators of future operating or stock price performance.\nThe combined company resulting from the recent acquisitions of FW and Ctrack may not perform as we or the market expects, which could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nThe combined company resulting from the recent acquisitions of FW and Ctrack may not perform as we or the market expects. Risks associated with the combined company following the acquisitions include:\n\u2022\nintegrating businesses is a difficult, expensive, and time-consuming process, and the failure to integrate successfully our business with the businesses of FW and Ctrack in the expected time frame would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations;\n\u2022\nthe acquisitions of FW and Ctrack will significantly increase the size of our operations, and if we are not able to effectively manage our expanded operations, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected;\n\u2022\nit is possible that our key employees or key employees of FW or Ctrack might decide not to remain with us as a result of the acquisitions, and the loss of such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects;\n\u2022\nrelationships with third parties and pre-existing customers may be affected by customer preferences or public attitudes about the acquisitions. Any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations; and\n\u2022\nthe price of our common stock may be affected by factors different from those that affected the price of our common stock prior to the acquisitions.\nIn addition, we cannot provide any assurances with respect to the accuracy of our assumptions with respect to future revenues or revenue growth rates, if any, of the combined company, and we cannot provide assurances with respect to our ability to realize any operating synergies or cost savings from these acquisitions. Risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forecasts or anticipated results include, but are not limited to, risks relating to our integrating the acquired businesses and managing the combined company successfully; unanticipated incremental costs that we may incur in connection with integrating the companies or managing a global company; and numerous risks and uncertainties that affect our industry generally and the markets for the products and services of our combined company.\nWe expect to continue to depend upon only a small number of our customers for a substantial portion of our revenues, and particularly with respect to our mobile computing and M2M hardware businesses, we do not have long-term contracts with many of our customers. Our business could be negatively affected by an adverse change in our dealings with these customers.\nA significant portion of our net revenues come from only a few customers. For instance, sales to Verizon Wireless accounted for 54%, 52% and 58% of our revenue in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Additionally, certain key customers of our Ctrack and FW subsidiaries, are governmental entities, and accordingly, their procurement decisions are subject to competitive bidding procedures. There can be no assurance that in future, Ctrack and FW will prevail in such competitive bidding processes and be awarded similar contracts from such customers.\nOur revenue could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to maintain currently-existing levels of business with any of our significant customers, including Verizon Wireless, and if we are unable to offset this loss fully from alternative customers. We expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future and any impairment of our relationship with, or the material financial impairment of, these customers could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, with respect to sales of mobile computing and M2M hardware, a majority of our customers purchase our products pursuant to contracts that do not require them to purchase any specific minimum quantity of units other than the number of units ordered on an individual purchase order that might be issued to us from time to time. These customers have no contractual obligation to continue to purchase our products and if they do not continue to make purchases consistent with their historical purchase levels, our net revenue would decline if we are unable to increase sales from other existing or new customers.\nIn light of the limited number of leading wireless operators and OEMs that form our primary customer base for our mobile computing hardware, it would be difficult to replace revenue resulting from the loss of any significant existing customer or from a material reduction in the volume of business we conduct with any significant existing customer. Consolidation among our customers may further concentrate our business to a more limited number of customers and expose us to increased risks relating to dependence on a limited number of customers; such dependence could adversely affect our operating results.\nIn addition, in the case of wireless operators and many of our governmental and large corporate customers, we are required to pass stringent tests to qualify and maintain our status as a supplier. This can be a lengthy process that may require approval of our engineering, documentation, manufacturing and quality control procedures before the customer will place volume orders. Attempts to lessen the adverse effect of any loss of, or any material reduction in the volume of business we conduct with, any significant existing customer through the rapid addition of one or more new customers may be difficult because of these qualification requirements. Consequently, our business and operating results could be adversely affected by the loss of, or any material reduction in the volume of business we conduct with, any existing significant customer.\nEntry into new lines of business, and our offering of new products and services, resulting from our recent acquisitions may result in exposure to new risks.\nCtrack operates primarily in the areas of SaaS telematics, vehicle tracking and fleet management and FW operates in the areas of telematics and telemetry, which are areas in which we have not previously conducted business. In addition, Ctrack and FW have business models, customers, sales cycles and operating activities that are substantially different from our traditional business that existed prior to these acquisitions. New lines of business, products or services could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls and could reduce our revenues and potentially generate losses. New\nproducts and services, or entrance into new markets, may require substantial time, resources and capital, and profitability targets may not be achieved. Entry into new markets entails inherent risks associated with our inexperience, which may result in costly decisions that could harm our profit and operating results. There are material inherent risks and uncertainties associated with offering new products and services, especially when new markets are not fully developed or when the laws and regulations regarding a new product or solution are not mature. Factors outside of our control, such as developing laws and regulations, regulatory orders, competitive product offerings and changes in commercial and consumer demand for products or services may also materially impact the successful implementation of new products or services. Failure to manage these risks, or failure of any product or service offerings to be successful and profitable, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to develop and timely introduce new products and services or enter new markets for our products and services successfully, we may not achieve our revenue targets or we may lose key customers or sales and our business could be harmed.\nThe development of new wireless data products requires technological innovation that can be difficult, lengthy and costly. Similarly, the development of new solutions for vehicle tracking, fleet management and telemetry applications can be difficult, lengthy and costly. In addition, wireless operators often require that products deployed on their networks comply with their own technical and product performance standards, which may differ from the standards our products are required to meet for other operators. This increases the complexity and might impact the timing of the product development and vendor approval processes undertaken by current and potential customers. Moreover, as we introduce new products or solutions, our current customers may not require or desire the features of these new offerings and may not purchase them or might purchase them in smaller quantities than we had expected. We may face similar risks that our products or solutions will not be accepted by customers as we enter new markets for our solutions, both in the U.S. and overseas.\nFurther, as part of our business, we may enter into contracts with some customers in which we would agree to develop products or solutions that we would sell to such customers. Our ability to generate future revenue and operating income under any such contracts would depend upon, among other factors, our ability to timely and profitably develop products or solutions that can be cost-effectively manufactured and that meet required design, technical and performance specifications.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage these risks or meet required delivery specifications or deadlines in connection with one or more of our key contracts, we may lose key customers or orders and our business could be harmed.\nThird parties may claim that our products, or components within our products, infringe on their intellectual property rights. These claims may result in substantial costs, diversion of resources and management attention, harm to our reputation or interference with our current or prospective customer or supplier relations.\nThird parties have in the past claimed, and may in the future claim, that we, or our customers or suppliers, have violated their intellectual property rights. Defending an infringement or misappropriation claim, for example, regardless of the merits or success of the claim, could result in our incurring substantial legal and other costs. These claims could also divert our engineering and other human resources and management attention and cause harm to our reputation. These claims can be difficult and costly to assess and defend. A successful infringement claim related to our products could result in, among other things, our becoming liable for damages and litigation costs or unexpected and costly engineering changes to affected products.\nIn addition, any finding that our products infringe (or in some instances, our customer\u2019s reasonable conclusion that a bona fide infringement claim is likely to be made with respect to such products) could have other negative consequences. Those consequences could include prohibiting us from further use of the intellectual property, causing us to have to modify our product design, if possible, so it does not infringe, or causing us to have to license the intellectual property at issue, incurring licensing fees, some of which could be retroactive. Upon a finding of infringement, we or one of our suppliers may also have to develop a non-infringing alternative, which, if available, could be costly and delay or prevent sales of affected products.\nA number of putative patent infringement claims have been filed by various plaintiffs in a number of U.S. District Courts against us and/or numerous third parties, some of whom are our customers. These cases generally allege that the defendants\u2019 use, sale and importation of specified products and/or processes constitutes infringement of certain U.S. patents allegedly owned or exclusively licensed by each plaintiff. Under certain circumstances, we may have an obligation to indemnify and/or defend our customers against these lawsuits.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, our competitive position and our business could be harmed.\nWe rely primarily on a combination of patent laws, trademark laws, copyright laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology. However, our issued patents and any future patents that may issue may not survive a legal challenge to their scope, validity or enforceability, or provide significant protection for\nus. The failure of our patents to adequately protect our technology might make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products or technologies. In addition, patents may not issue from any of our current or any future applications.\nMonitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. The steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. We may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Our competitors may also independently develop similar technology. In addition, the laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the U.S. Any failure by us to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could result in competitors offering products that incorporate our most technologically advanced features, which could seriously reduce demand for our products and solutions. In addition, we may in the future need to initiate infringement claims or litigation. Litigation, whether we are a plaintiff or a defendant, can be expensive, time consuming and may divert the efforts of our technical staff and managerial personnel, which could harm our business, whether or not such litigation results in a determination favorable to us.\nWe may not be able to maintain and expand our business if we are not able to hire, retain and manage additional qualified personnel.\nOur success in the future depends in part on the continued contribution of our executive, technical, engineering, sales, marketing, operations and administrative personnel. Recruiting and retaining skilled personnel in the industries in which we operate, including software and hardware engineers, is highly competitive. The success of any acquisition also depends in part on our retention and integration of key personnel from the acquired company or business.\nAlthough we may enter into employment agreements with members of our senior management and other key personnel, these arrangements do not prevent any of our management or key personnel from leaving the company. If we are not able to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future, or if we experience delays in hiring required personnel, particularly qualified engineers, we may not be able to maintain and expand our business.\nUncertainties relating to recent changes in our management team may adversely affect our operations.\nDuring recent periods, certain members of our management team have resigned from their positions as officers or managers. While we expect to engage in an orderly transition process as we integrate newly appointed officers and managers, we face a variety of risks and uncertainties relating to these resignations and new appointments, including diversion of management attention from business concerns, failure to retain other key personnel or inability to hire new key personnel.\nRISKS RELATED TO COMPETITION\nThe market for wireless broadband data access products and services is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. We may be unable to compete effectively.\nThe market for wireless broadband data access products and services is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. We expect competition to continue to increase and intensify. Many of our competitors or potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, operational and marketing resources than we do. These competitors, for example, may be able to respond more rapidly or more effectively than we can to new or emerging technologies, changes in customer requirements, supplier related developments, or a shift in the business landscape. They also may devote greater or more effective resources than we do to the development, manufacture, promotion, sale, and post-sale support of their respective products and services.\nMany of our current and potential competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer, supplier and other industry relationships that they can leverage to establish competitive dealings with many of our current and potential customers. Some of these companies also have more established and larger customer support organizations than we do. In addition, these companies may adopt more aggressive pricing policies or offer more attractive terms to customers than they currently do, or than we are able to do. They may bundle their competitive products with broader product offerings and may introduce new products and enhancements. Current and potential competitors might merge or otherwise establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their products or market position. In addition, at any time any given customer or supplier of ours could elect to enter our then existing line of business and thereafter compete with us, whether directly or indirectly. As a result, it is possible that new competitors or new or otherwise enhanced relationships among existing competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share to the detriment of our business.\nOur products compete with a variety of devices, including other wireless modems and mobile hotspots, wireless handsets, wireless handheld computing devices and M2M wireless solutions. Our current competitors include:\n\u2022\nwireless M2M solution providers, such as Sierra Wireless, Cradlepoint, Telit Wireless Solutions, Gemalto, CalAmp and Huawei;\n\u2022\nfleet management SaaS and services providers, such as Fleetmatics, MiX Telematics and Cartrack;\n\u2022\nwireless data modem and mobile hotspot providers, such as Huawei, ZTE, Sierra Wireless, PCD, LG Innotek, Samsung, Franklin Wireless and NetGear; and\n\u2022\nwireless handset manufacturers, such as HTC, Apple, Motorola, Nokia and Samsung.\nWe expect our competitors to continue to improve the features and performance of their current products and to introduce new products, services and technologies which, if successful, could reduce our sales and the market acceptance of our products, generate increased price competition and make our products obsolete. For our products to remain competitive, we must, among other things, continue to invest significant resources (financial, human and otherwise) in, among other things, research and development, sales and marketing, and customer support. We cannot be sure that we will have or will continue to have sufficient resources to make these investments or that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary for our products to remain competitive. Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer or smaller customer orders, reduced product margins and loss of our market share. Our failure to compete successfully could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe telematics and fleet management market is highly fragmented and competitive, with low barriers to entry. If we do not compete effectively, our operating results may be harmed.\nThe market for fleet management solutions is highly fragmented, consisting of a significant number of vendors, competitive and rapidly changing, with relatively low barriers to entry. Competition in this market is based primarily on the level of difficulty in installing, using and maintaining solutions, total cost of ownership, product performance, functionality, interoperability, brand and reputation, distribution channels, industries and the financial resources of the vendor. We expect competition to intensify in the future with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants. Mobile service and software providers, such as Google and makers of GPS navigation devices, such as Garmin, provide limited services at lower prices or at no charge, such as basic GPS-based mapping, tracking and turn-by-turn directions that could be expanded or further developed to more directly compete with our telematics solutions. Competition could result in reduced operating margins, increased sales and marketing expenses and the loss of market share, any of which would likely cause serious harm to our operating results.\nIndustry consolidation may result in increased competition, which could result in a loss of customers or a reduction in revenue.\nSome of our competitors have made or may make acquisitions or may enter into partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive services than they individually had offered or achieve greater economies of scale. In addition, new entrants not currently considered to be competitors may enter our market through acquisitions, partnerships or strategic relationships. We expect these trends to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions. Many of the potential entrants may have competitive advantages over us, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more varied services and larger marketing budgets, as well as greater financial, technical and other resources. These pressures could result in a substantial loss of our customers or a reduction in our revenue.\nRISKS RELATED TO CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES\nIf we do not properly manage the development of our business, we may experience significant strains on our management and operations and disruptions in our business.\nVarious risks arise if companies and industries quickly grow or evolve. If our business or industry develops more quickly than our ability to respond, our ability to meet customer demand in a timely and efficient manner could be challenged. We may also experience development, certification or production delays as we seek to meet demand for our products or unanticipated product requirements. Our failure to properly manage the developments that we or our industry might experience could negatively impact our ability to execute on our operating plan and, accordingly, could have an adverse impact on our business, our cash flow and results of operations and our reputation with our current or potential customers.\nUncertainty about our recent acquisitions of FW and Ctrack may adversely affect relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees.\nIn response to the consummation of last year\u2019s acquisitions of FW and Ctrack, our existing or prospective customers or suppliers may:\n\u2022\ndelay, defer or cease purchasing products or services from, or providing products or services to, the combined company;\n\u2022\ndelay or defer other decisions concerning the combined company; or\n\u2022\notherwise seek to change the terms on which they do business with the combined company.\nAny such delays or changes to terms could materially harm our business. In addition, as a result of our recent acquisitions of FW and Ctrack, current and prospective employees could experience uncertainty about their future with the combined company. As a result, key employees may depart because of issues relating to such uncertainty or a desire not to remain with us. Losses of customers, employees or other important strategic relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses related to the integration of FW and Ctrack.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of the business, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems of FW and Ctrack. There are a large number of systems and functions that must be integrated, including, but not limited to, management information, accounting and finance, billing, payroll and benefits and regulatory compliance. In addition, acquisitions of foreign entities, such as Ctrack, are particularly challenging because their prior practices may not meet the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and/or GAAP standards. While we have assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred, there are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of all of the expected integration expenses. Moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time. These expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings and synergies related to the integration of the businesses following the completion of the acquisitions.\nWe may not be able to consummate the divestiture of our telematics hardware assets in the timeframe we have planned on, or at all, which may adversely affect our results of operations and our stock price.\nThe sale of our telematics hardware assets to Micronet is anticipated to be consummated on or before March 31, 2016. However, the proposed divestiture is subject to a number of contingencies, including the parties entering into an acceptable manufacturing and supply agreement, certain of our employees accepting future employment with Micronet, and other customary closing conditions. If any of these contingencies were not to occur, or were not to occur prior to March 31, 2016, the consummation of the divestiture could be delayed or the Micronet APA terminated. Such a delay or failure to consummate the divestiture could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and stock price.\nIf the proposed divestiture of our telematics hardware assets is completed, our actual financial and operating results could differ materially from any expectations concerning future results, including (without limitation) expectations with respect to the financial impact of any cost savings.\nWe currently expect to realize material cost savings as a result of the proposed divestiture of our telematics hardware assets, and as a result, we currently believe that the divestiture will be accretive to our earnings per share, excluding transaction related expenses. However, these expectations are subject to numerous assumptions, such as our ability to successfully restructure our retained business and to negotiate favorable terms in a manufacturing and supply agreement with Micronet. If these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of the divestiture.\nOur corporate development activities could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs part of our business strategy, we review and intend to continue to review, acquisition and divestiture opportunities that we believe would be advantageous or complementary to the development of our business. Based on these opportunities, we may acquire additional businesses, assets, or technologies in the future. Alternatively, we may divest businesses, assets or technologies. All of these activities are subject to risks and uncertainties and could disrupt or harm our business. For example, if we make an acquisition, we could take any or all of the following actions, any one of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price:\n\u2022\nuse a substantial portion of our available cash;\n\u2022\nincur substantial debt, which may not be available to us on favorable terms and may adversely affect our liquidity;\n\u2022\nissue equity or equity-based securities that would dilute the percentage ownership of existing stockholders;\n\u2022\nassume contingent liabilities; and\n\u2022\ntake substantial charges in connection with acquired assets.\nAcquired businesses may have liabilities or adverse operating issues that we fail to discover through due diligence prior to the acquisition. In particular, to the extent that prior owners of any acquired businesses or properties failed to comply with or otherwise violated applicable laws or regulations, or failed to fulfill their contractual obligations to customers, we, as the successor owner, may be financially responsible for these violations and failures and may suffer reputational harm or otherwise be adversely affected. Acquisitions also frequently result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets which are subject to potential impairment in the future that could harm our financial results. In addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted, which could affect the market price of\nour stock. Acquisitions and/or the related equity financings could also impact our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards.\nNumerous other risks of engaging in acquisitions include: difficulties in assimilating acquired operations, products, technologies and personnel; unanticipated costs; diversion of management\u2019s attention from existing operations; adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience; and potential loss of key employees from either our existing business or the acquired organization. Acquisitions may result in substantial accounting charges for restructuring and other expenses, amortization of purchased technology and intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense, any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nConversely, there are many risks associated with corporate divestitures, including the proposed divestiture of our telematics hardware assets to Micronet. The numerous risks of engaging in sales of assets, technology or portions of our business include: difficulties separating divested operations from ongoing operations; loss of sales, marketing and operating synergies; loss of key employees and know-how related to the on-going portions of the business; unanticipated costs; diversion of management\u2019s attention from existing operations; and adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. Similar to discontinued operations, divestitures may be disruptive and result in substantial accounting charges for any related restructuring.\nAs a result, if we fail to properly evaluate or implement acquisitions or divestitures, including the proposed divestiture of our telematics hardware assets to Micronet, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such transactions, and we may incur unanticipated costs, either of which could harm our business and operating results.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND DEMAND FOR OUR SOLUTIONS\nOur inability to adapt to rapid technological change in our markets could impair our ability to remain competitive and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAll of the markets for goods and services in which we operate are characterized by rapid technological change, frequent introductions of new products and evolving customer demands and industry standards. In addition, we are affected by changes in the many industries related to the products or services we offer, including the automotive, telematics, wireless telemetry, mobile handset, GPS navigation device and work flow software industries. As the technologies used in each of these industries evolves, we will face new integration and competition challenges. For example, as automobile manufacturers evolve in-vehicle technology, GPS tracking devices may become standard equipment in new vehicles and compete against our solutions. If we are unable to adapt to rapid technological change, it could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to remain competitive.\nWe might forecast customer demand incorrectly and order the manufacture of excess or insufficient quantities of particular products.\nWe have historically placed purchase orders with our manufacturers at least three months prior to the scheduled delivery of the corresponding finished goods to our customer. In some instances, due to the length of component lead times, we might need to place manufacturing orders with our contract manufacturers solely on the basis of our receipt of a good-faith, but non-binding, customer forecast of the quantity and timing of the customer\u2019s expected purchases from us. Accordingly, if the actual number and timing of delivery of units that a customer orders from us on the subsequently issued purchase order differs materially from the number of units we contractually ordered our manufacturer to procure component parts for, we might be unable to obtain adequate quantities of components in time to meet our customers\u2019 binding delivery requirements or, alternatively, we might accumulate excess inventory that we are unable to timely use or resell, if at all. Our operating results and financial condition have in the past been, and may in the future be, materially adversely affected by our ability to manage our current or finished goods inventory levels, and respond to short-term or unexpected shifts in customer demand as to quantities or our customer\u2019s product delivery schedule.\nThe sale of our mobile computing and M2M hardware products depends on the demand for broadband wireless access to enterprise networks and the Internet.\nThe markets for broadband wireless access solutions are rapidly evolving, both technologically and competitively, and the successful sale of related products and services depends in part on the strength of the demand for wireless access to both enterprise networks and the Internet. At times, market demand for both wireless products and wireless access services for the transmission of data developed at a slower rate than we had anticipated and as a result our product sales did not generate sufficient revenue to cover our corresponding operating costs. The failure of these markets to continue to grow at the rate that we currently anticipate may adversely impact the growth in the demand for our products and, subsequently, our overall rate of growth and as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.\nWeakness or deterioration in global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a result of weak or deteriorating economic conditions globally, we could experience lower demand for our products, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nAdditionally, there could be a number of related effects on our business resulting from weak economic conditions, including the insolvency of one or more of our parts suppliers resulting in product launch or product delivery delays, customer insolvencies resulting in that customer\u2019s inability to order products from us or pay for already delivered product, an inability on the part of our customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and reduced demand by the ultimate end-users of our products.\nAlthough we continue to monitor market conditions, we cannot predict future market conditions or their impact on demand for our products.\nIf we fail to develop and maintain strategic relationships, we may not be able to penetrate new markets.\nA key element of our business strategy is to penetrate new markets by developing new products through strategic relationships with industry participants. We are currently investing, and plan to continue to invest, significant resources to develop these relationships. We believe that our success in penetrating new markets for our products will depend, in part, on our ability to develop and maintain these relationships and to cultivate additional or alternative relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to develop additional strategic relationships, that existing relationships will survive and successfully achieve their purposes or that the companies with whom we have strategic relationships will not form competing arrangements with others or determine to compete unilaterally with us.\nOur failure to predict carrier and end user customer preferences among the many evolving wireless industry standards could hurt our ability to introduce and sell new products.\nWith respect to our mobile computing and M2M hardware devices, it is critical to our success that we accurately anticipate evolving wireless technology standards and that our products comply with these standards in relevant respects. We are currently focused on engineering and manufacturing products that comply with several different wireless standards. Any failure of our products to comply with any one of these or future applicable standards could prevent or delay their introduction and require costly and time-consuming engineering changes. Additionally, if an insufficient number of wireless operators or subscribers adopt the standards to which we engineer our products, then sales of our new products designed to those standards could be materially harmed.\nThe marketability of our products may suffer if wireless telecommunications operators do not deliver acceptable wireless services.\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on the capacity, affordability, reliability and prevalence of wireless data networks provided by wireless telecommunications operators and on which our mobile computing and M2M hardware products operate. Currently, various wireless telecommunications operators, either individually or jointly with us, sell our products in connection with the sale of their wireless data services to their customers. Growth in demand for wireless data access may be limited if, for example, wireless telecommunications operators cease or materially curtail operations, fail to offer services that customers consider valuable at acceptable prices, fail to maintain sufficient capacity to meet demand for wireless data access, delay the expansion of their wireless networks and services, fail to offer and maintain reliable wireless network services or fail to market their services effectively.\nIn addition, our future growth depends on the successful deployment of next generation wireless data networks provided by third parties, including those networks for which we are currently developing products. If these next generation networks are not deployed or widely accepted, or if deployment is delayed, there will be no market for the products we are developing to operate on these networks. If any of these events occurs, or if for any other reason the demand for wireless data access fails to grow, sales of our products will decline or remain stagnant and our business could be harmed.\nRISKS RELATED TO DEVELOPING, MANUFACTURING AND DELIVERING OUR SOLUTIONS\nWe currently rely on third parties to manufacture and warehouse many of our products, which exposes us to a number of risks and uncertainties outside our control.\nWe currently outsource the manufacturing of all of our mobile computing solutions and many of our M2M devices to companies including: AsiaTelco Technologies Co., Inventec Appliances Corporation, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd. and Production Logix CC. If one of these third-party manufacturers were to experience delays, disruptions, capacity constraints or quality control problems in its manufacturing operations, product shipments to our customers could be delayed or rejected or our customers could consequently elect to cancel the underlying product purchase order. These disruptions would negatively\nimpact our revenues, competitive position and reputation. Further, if we are unable to manage successfully our relationship with a manufacturer, the quality and availability of our products may be harmed. None of our third-party manufacturers is obligated to supply us with a specific quantity of products, except as may be provided in a particular purchase order that we have submitted to, and that has been accepted by, such third-party manufacturer. Our third-party manufacturers could, under some circumstances, decline to accept new purchase orders from us or otherwise reduce their business with us. If a manufacturer stopped manufacturing our products for any reason or reduced manufacturing capacity, we may be unable to replace the lost manufacturing capacity on a timely and comparatively cost effective basis, which would adversely impact our operations. In addition, we generally do not enter into long-term contracts with our manufacturers. As a result, we are subject to price increases due to availability, and subsequent price volatility, in the marketplace of the components and materials needed to manufacture our products. If a third-party manufacturer were to negatively change the product pricing and other terms under which it agrees to manufacture for us and we were unable to locate a suitable alternative manufacturer, our manufacturing costs could significantly increase.\nBecause we outsource the manufacturing of so many of our products, the cost, quality and availability of third-party manufacturing operations is essential to the successful production and sale of our products. Our reliance on third-party manufacturers exposes us to a number of risks which are outside our control, including:\n\u2022\nunexpected increases in manufacturing costs;\n\u2022\ninterruptions in shipments if a third-party manufacturer is unable to complete production in a timely manner;\n\u2022\ninability to control quality of finished products;\n\u2022\ninability to control delivery schedules;\n\u2022\ninability to control production levels and to meet minimum volume commitments to our customers;\n\u2022\ninability to control manufacturing yield;\n\u2022\ninability to maintain adequate manufacturing capacity; and\n\u2022\ninability to secure adequate volumes of acceptable components at suitable prices or in a timely manner.\nAlthough we promote ethical business practices and our operations personnel periodically visit and monitor the operations of our manufacturers, we do not control the manufacturers or their labor practices. If our current manufacturers, or any other third-party manufacturer which we may use in the future, violate U.S. or foreign laws or regulations, we may be subjected to extra duties, significant monetary penalties, adverse publicity, the seizure and forfeiture of products that we are attempting to import or the loss of our import privileges. The effects of these factors could render the conduct of our business in a particular country undesirable or impractical and have a negative impact on our operating results.\nProduct liability, product replacement, or recall costs could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nWe are subject to product liability and product recall claims if any of our products and services are alleged to have resulted in injury to persons or damage to property. If any of our products proves to be defective, we may need to recall and/or redesign them. In addition, any claim or product recall that results in significant adverse publicity may negatively affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We maintain product liability insurance, but this insurance may not adequately cover losses related to product liability claims brought against us. We may also be a defendant in class action litigation, for which no insurance is available. Product liability insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, we do not maintain any product recall insurance, so any product recall we are required to initiate could have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe depend on sole source suppliers for some components used in our products and solutions. The availability and sale of those products and solutions would be harmed if any of these suppliers is not able to meet our demand and production schedule and alternative suitable components are not available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nOur products contain a variety of components, some of which are procured from single suppliers. In addition, some of our vehicle tracking or fleet management solutions rely on devices procured from single suppliers. From time to time, certain components used in our products or certain products used in our solutions have been in short supply or their anticipated commercial introduction has been delayed or their availability has been subsequently interrupted for reasons outside our control. If there is a shortage or interruption in the availability to us of any such components or products and we cannot timely obtain a commercially and technologically suitable substitute or make sufficient and timely design or other modifications to permit the use of such a substitute component or product, we may not be able to timely deliver sufficient quantities of our products or solutions to satisfy our contractual obligations and particular revenue expectations. Moreover, even if we timely locate a substitute part or product, but its price materially exceeds the original cost of the component or product, then our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur business depends on our continued ability to license necessary third-party technology, which we may not be able to do on commercially competitive terms, if at all.\nWe license technology from third parties for our products and solutions. We have licensed from third parties, such as Qualcomm, software, patents and other intellectual property for use in our products and from time to time we may elect or be required to license additional intellectual property. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our third-party licenses or that these licenses or the technologies that are the subject of these licenses will not be the subject of dispute or litigation, or that additional third-party licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The inability to maintain or obtain third-party licenses required for our products or to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to seek to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards, if such exists, or at greater cost, which could seriously harm our competitive position, revenue and prospects.\nOur products, including our proprietary or third party software contained in our products, may contain errors or defects, which could prevent or decrease their market acceptance and lead to unanticipated costs or other adverse business consequences.\nOur products are technologically complex and must meet stringent industry, regulatory and customer requirements. We must develop our hardware and software products quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing and technologically advanced markets we serve. Products or solutions as sophisticated as ours may contain undetected errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions or features are released. Our products or software may not be free from errors or defects at the time commercial shipments have begun, which could result in the rejection of our products or solutions, the loss of an existing or potential customer or the failure to obtain one, damage to our reputation, lost revenue, diverted development resources, increased customer service and support costs, unanticipated warranty claims, and the payment of monetary damages to our customers. Furthermore, correcting problems could require additional capital expenditures, result in increased design and development costs, and force us to divert resources from other efforts. Failure to remediate problems could result in lost revenue, harm our reputation, and lead to costly warranty or other legal claims against us by our customers, and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nWe may be subject to breaches of our information technology systems, which could damage our reputation, vendor, and customer relationships, and our customers\u2019 access to our services.\nOur business operations require that we use and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information, in our secure data centers and on our networks. We face a number of threats to our data centers and networks in the form of unauthorized access, security breaches and other system disruptions, and these risks may increase as we continue to expand our international operations. It is critical to our business strategy that our infrastructure remains secure and is perceived by customers and partners to be secure. We implement industry standard security measures, but nonetheless, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or other disruptive problems. Any such security breach may compromise information used or stored on our networks and may result in significant data losses or theft of our, our customers\u2019, or our business partners\u2019 intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information. A cybersecurity breach could negatively affect our reputation by adversely affecting the market\u2019s perception of the security or reliability of our products or services. In addition, a cyber-attack could result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, disruption of internal operations, increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenues or litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED TO INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS\nDue to the global nature of our operations, we are subject to political and economic risks of doing business internationally.\nOur largest subsidiary, Ctrack, is headquartered in South Africa and conducts business in over 50 countries. Most of our mobile computing and M2M devices are manufactured in Asia or South Africa. Most of our employees are located outside the U.S., and international revenue represents a significant percentage of our worldwide revenue. The risks inherent in global operations include:\n\u2022\ndifficulty managing sales, product development and logistics and support across continents;\n\u2022\nlimitations on ownership or participation in local enterprises;\n\u2022\nlack of familiarity with, and unexpected changes in, foreign laws and legal standards, including employment laws, product liability laws, privacy laws and environmental laws, which may vary widely across the countries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nincreased expense to comply with U.S. laws that apply to foreign operations, including the FCPA and Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations;\n\u2022\ncompliance with, and potentially adverse tax consequences of, foreign tax regimes;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, currency exchange controls, price controls and limitations on repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays and interruptions;\n\u2022\nlocal economic conditions;\n\u2022\npolitical, social and economic instability and disruptions;\n\u2022\nacts of terrorism and other security concerns;\n\u2022\ngovernment embargoes or foreign trade restrictions such as tariffs, duties, taxes or other controls;\n\u2022\nimport and export controls;\n\u2022\nincreased product development costs due to differences among countries\u2019 safety regulations and radio frequency allocation schemes and standards;\n\u2022\nincreased expense related to localization of products and development of foreign language marketing and sales materials;\n\u2022\nlonger sales cycles;\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022\nworkforce reorganizations in various locations;\n\u2022\nrestrictive employment regulations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and increased expense in implementing corporate policies and controls;\n\u2022\ninternational intellectual property laws, which may be more restrictive or may offer lower levels of protection than U.S. law;\n\u2022\ncompliance with differing and changing local laws and regulations in multiple international locations, including regional data privacy laws, as well as compliance with U.S. laws and regulations where applicable in these international locations; and\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding our international business, the risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Further, operating in international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources. Due to the additional uncertainties and risks of doing business in foreign jurisdictions, international acquisitions tend to entail risks and require additional oversight and management attention that are typically not attendant to acquisitions made within the U.S. We cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required to establish, acquire or integrate operations in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, especially the South African Rand against the U.S. Dollar, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenues are generated from sales agreements denominated in foreign currencies, and we expect to enter into additional such agreements as we expand our international customer base. In addition, we employ a significant number of employees outside the U.S., and the associated employment and facilities costs are denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We have particularly large exposure in South Africa where our Ctrack subsidiary is headquartered and the costs of operating in South Africa are subject to the effects of exchange fluctuations of the South African Rand against the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies, particularly the South African Rand against the U.S. Dollar, will create greater uncertainty in our revenues and can significantly and adversely affect our operating results.\nAt times, we may attempt to manage this risk, in part, by minimizing the effects of volatility on cash flows by identifying forecasted transactions exposed to these risks and using foreign exchange forward contracts. Since there is a high correlation between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures, the gains and losses on these underlying exposures are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the hedging instruments. We may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading or speculative purposes. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that we will not incur foreign currency losses or that foreign exchange forward contracts we may enter into to reduce the risk of such losses will be successful.\nRISKS RELATED TO REGULATORY COMPLIANCE\nOur expanded international operations following our recent acquisition of Ctrack may increase our exposure to potential liability under anti-corruption, trade protection, tax and other laws and regulations.\nThe FCPA and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (\u201cAnti-Corruption Laws\u201d) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors or agents. From time to time, we may receive inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere about our business activities outside of the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. While we devote substantial resources to our global compliance programs and have implemented policies, training and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments, our employees, vendors or agents may violate our policies. Our recent acquisition of Ctrack may significantly increase our exposure to potential liability.\nOur failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Operations outside of the U.S. may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment.\nDue to our recent acquisition of Ctrack, we are now subject to certain foreign tax regulations that did not apply to us previously. Such regulations may not be clear, not consistently applied and subject to sudden change, particularly with regard to international transfer pricing. Our earnings could be reduced by the uncertain and changing nature of such tax regulations.\nAny changes to existing accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices may cause adverse fluctuations in our reported results of operations or affect how we conduct our business.\nA change in accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements, taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements or taxation rules have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. The change to existing rules, future changes, if any, or the need for us to modify a current tax position may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.\nEvolving regulations and changes in applicable laws relating to data privacy may increase our expenditures related to compliance efforts or otherwise limit the solutions we can offer, which may harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur products and solutions enable us to collect, manage and store a wide range of data related to vehicle tracking and fleet management such as vehicle location and fuel usage, speed and mileage. Some of the data we collect or use in our business is subject to data privacy laws. The U.S. federal government and various state governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, distribution and use of personal information. Many foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union and the United Kingdom, have adopted legislation (including directives or regulations) that increase or change the requirements governing data collection and storage in these jurisdictions. Ctrack markets its products in over 50 countries, and accordingly, our acquisition of Ctrack has made us subject to many different, and potentially conflicting, privacy laws. If our privacy or data security measures fail to comply, or are perceived to fail to comply, with current or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations or other liabilities.\nFailure or circumvention of our controls and procedures could seriously harm our business.\nAny system of control and procedures, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the controls and procedures are met. Acquired companies or businesses are likely to have different standards, controls, contracts, procedures and policies, making it more difficult to implement and harmonize company-wide financial, accounting, billing, information and other systems. Acquisitions of privately held companies and/or non-U.S. companies are particularly challenging because their prior practices in these areas may not meet the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or public accounting standards. The failure or circumvention of our controls, policies and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nWe may not be able to develop products that comply with applicable government regulations.\nOur products must comply with government regulations. For example, in the U.S., the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, regulates many aspects of communications devices, including radiation of electromagnetic energy, biological safety and rules for devices to be connected to telephone networks. In addition to the federal government, some states have adopted regulations applicable to our products. Radio frequency devices, which include our modems, must be approved by obtaining equipment authorization from the FCC prior to being offered for sale. Regulatory requirements in Africa, Europe, Asia and other jurisdictions must also be met. Additionally, we cannot anticipate the effect that changes in domestic or foreign government regulations may have on our ability to develop and sell products in the future. Failure to\ncomply with existing or evolving government regulations or to obtain timely regulatory approvals or certificates for our products could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations or cash flows.\nIf we do not achieve applicable black economic empowerment objectives in our South African businesses, we risk not being able to renew certain of our existing contracts which service South African government and quasi-governmental customers, as well as not being awarded future corporate and governmental contracts which would result in the loss of revenue.\nThe South African government, through the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act, No. 53 of 2003, the codes of good practice and industry charters published pursuant thereto (collectively \u201cBBBEE\u201d) has established a legislative framework for the promotion of broad-based black economic empowerment. Achievement of BBBEE objectives is measured by a scorecard which establishes a weighting for the various components of BBBEE. BBBEE objectives are pursued in significant part by requiring parties who contract with corporates, governmental or quasi-governmental entities in South Africa to achieve BBBEE compliance through satisfaction of an applicable scorecard. Parties improve their BBBEE score when contracting with businesses that have earned good BBBEE ratings in relation to their scorecards (this includes black-owned businesses).\nCtrack has material contracts with governmental entities that require it to maintain minimum BBBEE rating levels as measured under the BBBEE scorecard. Failure to achieve applicable BBBEE objectives could jeopardize our ability to maintain existing business or to secure future business from these and other corporate, governmental or quasi-governmental customers that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFollowing our acquisition of Ctrack, we are now required to comply with South African labor laws with respect to certain of our employees and face the risk of disruption from labor disputes in South Africa, which could result in additional operating costs.\nSouth African laws relating to labor regulate work time, provide for mandatory compensation in the event of termination of employment for operational reasons, and impose monetary penalties for non-compliance with administrative and reporting requirements in respect of affirmative action policies, could result in additional operating costs. In addition, future changes to South African legislation and regulations relating to labor may increase our costs or alter our relationship with our employees and result in labor disruptions. Resulting disruptions could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNING OUR SECURITIES\nOur share price has been highly volatile in the past and could be highly volatile in the future.\nThe market price of our stock can be highly volatile due to the risks and uncertainties described in this report, as well as other factors, including substantial volatility in revenues and earnings due to our current dependence on a small number of significant customers; comments by securities analysts; announcements by us or others regarding, among other things, operating results, additions or departures of key personnel, acquisitions or divestitures, additional equity or debt financing or technological innovations, introductions of new products or litigation; price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, and particularly with respect to market prices and trading volumes of other high technology stocks; and our failure to meet market expectations.\nOver the two-year period ended January 31, 2016, the closing price of our common stock as reported on The NASDAQ Global Select Market ranged from a high of $6.66 to a low of $0.93. The stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that were unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility have sometimes subsequently become the subject of securities class action litigation. If litigation were instituted on this basis, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future. We may not be able to raise such additional funds on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe may need to raise substantial additional capital in the future to fund our operations, continue our research and development, develop and commercialize new products and solutions or acquire companies. If we require additional funds in the future, we may not be able to obtain those funds on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any debt or additional equity financing that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders.\nIf we do not have, or are not able to obtain, sufficient funds, we may have to delay development or commercialization of our products and solutions, liquidate some or all of our assets, or delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate some or all of our sales and marketing expansion programs. Any of these actions could harm our operating results.\nIf financial or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue negative or misleading evaluations of our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. If one or more of the analysts who cover us were to adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price could decline. If one or more of the analysts who cover us cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness, including our 5.50% convertible senior notes due 2020 (the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d), depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and other fixed charges, fund working capital needs and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nDespite our current consolidated debt levels, we may still incur substantially more debt or take other actions which would intensify the risks discussed above.\nDespite our current consolidated debt levels, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, including secured debt. The Indenture governing the Convertible Notes will permit us or our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness or to take a number of other actions that could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness, including the Convertible Notes.\nCertain provisions in the Indenture governing the Convertible Notes could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover or takeover attempt of us.\nCertain provisions in the Indenture governing the Convertible Notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, if a takeover would constitute a fundamental change, holders of the Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Convertible Notes in cash. In addition, if a takeover constitutes a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), we may be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their Convertible Notes in connection with such takeover. In either case, and in other cases, our obligations under the Convertible Notes and the Indenture could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us.\nFuture issuances of our common stock or instruments convertible or exercisable into our common stock, including in connection with conversions of Convertible Notes or exercises of warrants, may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock and cause dilution to our existing stockholders.\nWe may obtain additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in the near future, subject to certain limitations in the agreements governing our indebtedness. If we issue additional shares of common stock or instruments convertible into common stock, it may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock. In addition, the conversion of some or all of the Convertible Notes and/or the exercise of some or all of the warrants may dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders, and any sales in the public market of any of our common stock issuable upon such conversion or exercise could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding warrants to purchase 1,886,630 shares of our common stock. These warrants are generally only exercisable on a cash basis; provided, however, that the warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis if and only if a registration statement relating to the issuance of the shares underlying the warrants is not then effective or an exemption from registration is not available for the resale of such shares. Any such net exercise will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders without any corresponding benefit to the Company of a cash payment for the exercise price of such warrant.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $120.0 million in outstanding Convertible Notes. Prior to December 15, 2019, holders may convert their Convertible Notes only if certain conditions are met. The Convertible Notes are convertible into cash, shares of the Company's common stock, or a combination thereof, at the election of the Company, and are initially convertible into 24,000,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, based on an initial conversion rate of 200.0000 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $5.00 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment if certain events occur; provided that, in no event will the conversion rate exceed 250 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $4.00 per share of common stock, or a maximum of 30,000,000 shares of common stock). If we elect to settle conversions of the Convertible Notes with common stock, this may cause significant dilution to our existing stockholders.", "PERMNO": 88807, "SIC": 3661, "TIC": "INSG"}
