{"cik": "939930", "company": "PYXUS INTERNATIONAL, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-08-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our operating results, our financial condition, and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report.\nWe may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in filings with the SEC, in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor calls and webcasts. You can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words such as \u201cstrategy,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201ccontinues,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201cgoals,\u201d \u201ctargets\u201d and other words of similar meaning. You can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.\nWe cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, or projected. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in Pyxus International, Inc. securities or in the securities of New Pyxus following the effectiveness of the Plan, as it, though its subsidiaries, will continue to operate the businesses we operate immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Plan. In connection with the \u201csafe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are identifying important risk factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us; any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements. We elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document. It is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Consequently, the following should not be considered a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time.\nRisks Related to the Chapter 11 Cases\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, our historical financial information may not be indicative of our future performance, which may be volatile.\nDuring the Chapter 11 Cases, we expect our financial results to be volatile as restructuring activities and expenses, contract terminations and rejections, and claims assessments significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our historical financial performance is likely not indicative of our financial performance after the date of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nCertain information contained in our historical financial statements will not be comparable to the information contained in our financial statements after the application of fresh start accounting.\nIf the Company meets the criteria set forth in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 852 - Reorganizations (\u201cASC 852\u201d), New Pyxus will adopt the fresh start accounting rules upon emergence from Chapter 11, in which case its assets and liabilities will be recorded at fair value as of the fresh start reporting date, which may differ materially from the recorded values of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not reflect the adoption of fresh start accounting.\nThe Chapter 11 Cases may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe Chapter 11 Cases could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. In the months prior to and during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, our management was required to spend a significant amount of time and effort dealing with the restructuring instead of focusing on our business operations. In addition, as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, our customers, farmers and other suppliers might lose confidence in us and may seek to establish alternative commercial relationships, which may cause, among other things, our suppliers, farmers, vendors, counterparties and service providers to renegotiate the terms of our agreements, attempt to terminate their relationship with us or require financial assurances from us. Many of our suppliers, farmers, vendors and other providers may require stricter terms and conditions, and we may not find these terms and conditions acceptable. Any failure to timely obtain suitable inventory at competitive prices could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe have typically financed our non-U.S. local leaf tobacco operations with short-term operating credit lines at the local level. These operating lines are typically seasonal in nature, normally extending for a term of 180 to 270 days corresponding to the tobacco crop cycle in that location. Certain of these facilities are uncommitted in that the lenders have the right to cease making loans or demand payment of outstanding loans at any time. As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, these local lenders may lose confidence in us and, with respect to uncommitted facilities, may cease making loans or demand payment of outstanding loans or, with respect to committed facilities, decline to renew or extend existing facilities, or require stricter terms and conditions with respect to future facilities, and we may not find these terms and conditions acceptable or they may overly restrict our ability to conduct our businesses successfully. An inability to maintain adequate financing to fund our non-U.S. local leaf tobacco operations in any significant location could result in a significant decline in our revenues, profitability and cash flow.\nEven if the Plan is consummated and becomes effective, we may not be able to achieve our stated goals and we cannot assure you of our ability to continue as a going concern.\nEven if the Plan is consummated and becomes effective, we may continue to face a number of risks, such as changes in economic conditions, continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in the leaf tobacco market and the markets for our other products, other changes in demand for our products and increasing expenses. Some of these risks may become more acute because of our involvement in the Chapter 11 Cases. As a result of these risks and others, we cannot guarantee that the Plan will achieve our stated goals. Furthermore, even though certain of our debts will be discharged through the Plan, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing or other various means to fund our business after the completion of the Chapter 11 Cases, including short-term operating credit lines to fund the needs of our non-U.S. local leaf tobacco operations. Our access to necessary financing may be limited, if it is available at all. Therefore, adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. As a result, we cannot assure you of our ability to continue as a going concern following the consummation and effectiveness of the Plan.\nRisks Relating to Our Tobacco Operations\nOur reliance on a small number of significant customers may adversely affect our financial statements.\nThe customers of our leaf tobacco business are manufacturers of cigarette and other tobacco products. Several of these customers individually account for a significant portion of our sales in a normal year.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2020, each of Philip Morris International, Inc. and China Tobacco International Inc., including their respective affiliates, accounted for more than 10% of our revenues from continuing operations. In addition, tobacco product manufacturers have experienced consolidation and further consolidation among our customers could decrease such\ncustomers\u2019 demand for our leaf tobacco or processing services. The loss of any one or more of our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.\nContinued vertical integration by our customers could materially adversely affect our financial statements.\nDemand for our leaf tobacco or processing services could be materially reduced if cigarette manufacturers continue to significantly vertically integrate their operations, either through acquisition of our competitors, establishing new operations or contracting directly with suppliers. Japan Tobacco, Inc. has vertically integrated operations in Malawi, Brazil, and the United States. In addition, Philip Morris International, Inc. acquired supplier contracts and related assets in Brazil in order to procure leaf directly. In general, our results of operations have been adversely affected by vertical integration initiatives. Although some customers have reversed certain aspects of their previous vertical integration of operations, further vertical integration by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.\nGlobal shifts in sourcing customer requirements may negatively affect our organizational structure and asset base.\nThe global leaf tobacco industry has experienced shifts in the sourcing of customer requirements for tobacco. For example, significant tobacco production volume decreases have occurred in the United States and Europe from historical levels. At the same time, production volumes in other sourcing origins have stabilized. Additional shifts in sourcing may occur as a result of currency fluctuations, including changes in currency exchange rates against the United States Dollar (\"USD\"), the imposition of tariffs and other changes in international trade policies. A shift in sourcing origins in Europe has been influenced by modifications to the tobacco price support system in the European Union (\"EU\"). Customer requirements have changed due to these variations in production, which could influence our ability to plan effectively for the longer term in the United States and Europe.\nWe may not be able to timely or efficiently adjust to shifts in sourcing origins, and adjusting to shifts may require changes in our production facilities in certain origins and changes in our fixed asset base. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, restructuring charges as we continue to adjust to shifts in sourcing. Adjusting our capacity and adjusting to shifts in sourcing may have an adverse impact on our ability to manage our costs and could have an adverse effect on our financial performance.\nWe may not have access to available capital to finance our local leaf tobacco operations in non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nWe have typically financed our non-U.S. local leaf tobacco operations with uncommitted short-term operating credit lines at the local level. These operating lines are typically seasonal in nature, normally extending for a term of 180 to 270 days corresponding to the tobacco crop cycle in that location. These facilities are typically uncommitted in that the lenders have the right to cease making loans or demand payment of outstanding loans at any time. In addition, each of these operating lines must be renewed with each tobacco crop season in that jurisdiction. Although our foreign subsidiaries are the borrowers under these lines, many of them are guaranteed by us.\nAs of March 31, 2020, we had approximately $540.2 million outstanding on the short-term foreign seasonal lines with maximum capacity of $745.5 million, subject to limitations under our asset-based revolving credit facility (the \"ABL Facility\"). Additionally, against these lines there was $12.8 million available in unused letter of credit capacity with $7.0 million issued but unfunded.\nBecause the lenders under these operating lines typically have the right to cancel the loan at any time and each line must be renewed with each crop season, we cannot assure you that this capital will be available to our subsidiaries. If a number of these lenders cease lending to our subsidiaries or dramatically decrease such lending, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Further, there is additional risk that certain banks that are lenders under seasonal lines could be unable to meet contractually obligated borrowing requests in the future if their financial condition were to deteriorate.\nOur financial results will vary according to growing conditions, customer indications and other factors, which reduces your ability to gauge our quarterly and annual financial performance.\nOur financial results, particularly the quarterly financial results, may be significantly affected by fluctuations in tobacco growing seasons and crop sizes which affect the supply of tobacco. Crop sizes may be affected by, among other things, crop infestation and disease, the volume of annual tobacco plantings and yields realized by suppliers, and suppliers' elections to grow crops other than tobacco. The cultivation period for tobacco is dependent upon a number of factors, including the weather and other natural events, such as hurricanes or tropical storms, and our processing schedule and results of operations for any quarterly period can be significantly altered by these factors.\nThe cost of acquiring tobacco can fluctuate greatly due to crop sizes and increased competition in certain markets in which we purchase tobacco. For example, short crops in periods of high demand translate into higher average green prices, higher throughput costs and less volume to sell. Furthermore, large crops translate into lower average green prices, lower throughput costs and excess volume to sell.\nThe timing and unpredictability of customer indications, orders, and shipments cause us to keep tobacco in inventory, increase our risk, and result in variations in quarterly and annual financial results. The timing of shipments can be materially impacted by shortages of containers and vessels for shipping as well as infrastructure and accessibility issues in ports we use for shipment. We may, from time to time in the ordinary course of business, keep a significant amount of processed tobacco in inventory for our customers to accommodate their inventory management and other needs. Sales recognition by us and our subsidiaries is based on the passage of ownership, usually with shipment of product. Because individual shipments may represent significant amounts of revenue, our quarterly and annual financial results may vary significantly depending on our customers\u2019 needs and shipping instructions. These fluctuations result in varying volumes and sales in given periods, which also reduces your ability to compare our financial results in different periods or in the same periods in different years.\nSuppliers who have historically grown tobacco and from whom we have purchased tobacco may elect to grow other crops instead of tobacco, which affects the world supply of tobacco and may impact our quarterly and annual financial performance.\nIncreases in the prices for other crops have led and may in the future lead suppliers who have historically grown tobacco, and from whom we have purchased tobacco, to elect to grow these other, more profitable, items instead of tobacco. A decrease in the volume of tobacco available for purchase may increase the purchase price of such tobacco. As a result, we could experience an increase in tobacco crop acquisition costs, which may impact our quarterly and annual financial performance.\nOur advancement of inputs to tobacco suppliers could expose us to losses.\nAdvances to tobacco suppliers are settled as part of the consideration paid upon the suppliers delivering us unprocessed tobacco at market prices. Two primary factors determine the market value of the tobacco suppliers deliver to us: the quantity of tobacco delivered and the quality of the tobacco delivered. Unsatisfactory quantities or quality of the tobacco delivered could result in losses with respect to advances to our tobacco suppliers or the deferral of those advances.\nWhen we purchase tobacco directly from suppliers, we bear the risk that the tobacco will not meet our customers\u2019 quality and quantity requirements.\nIn countries where we contract directly with tobacco suppliers, we bear the risk that the tobacco delivered will not meet quality and quantity requirements of our customers. If the tobacco does not meet such market requirements, we may not be able to sell the tobacco we agreed to buy and may not be able to meet all of our customers\u2019 orders, which would have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\nWeather and other conditions can affect the marketability of our inventory.\nLike other agricultural products, the quality of tobacco is affected by weather and the environment, which can change the quality or size of the crop. If a weather event is particularly severe, such as a major drought or hurricane, the affected crop could be destroyed or damaged to an extent that it would be less desirable to our customers, which would result in a reduction in revenues. If such an event is also widespread, it could affect our ability to acquire the quantity of products required by customers. In addition, other items can affect the marketability of tobacco, including, among other things, the presence of:\n\u2022non-tobacco related material;\n\u2022genetically modified organisms; and\n\u2022excess residues of pesticides, fungicides and herbicides.\nA significant event impacting the condition or quality of a large amount of any of the tobacco crops we buy could make it difficult for us to sell such tobacco or to fill our customers\u2019 orders. In addition, in the event of climate change, adverse weather patterns could develop in the growing regions in which we purchase tobacco. Such adverse weather patterns could result in more permanent disruptions in the quality and size of the available crop, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe face increased risks of doing business due to the extent of our international operations.\nSome of the countries we do business in do not have stable economies or governments. Our international operations are subject to international business risks, including unsettled political conditions, uncertainty in the enforcement of legal obligations, including the collection of accounts receivable, fraud risks, expropriation, import and export restrictions, exchange controls, inflationary economies, currency risks, and risks related to the restrictions on repatriation of earnings or proceeds from liquidated assets of foreign subsidiaries. These risks are exacerbated in countries where we have advanced substantial sums or guaranteed local loans or lines of credit for the purchase of tobacco from suppliers. For example, in 2006 as a result of the political environment, economic instability, foreign currency controls, and governmental regulations in Zimbabwe, we deconsolidated our Zimbabwe subsidiary, Mashonaland Tobacco Company LTD (\"MTC\"). Subsequently, we determined that the significant doubt about our ability to control MTC was eliminated and reconsolidated MTC as of March 31, 2016. The Company utilizes the Zimbabwe RTGS system for local transactions. RTGS is a local currency equivalent that is exchanged at a government specified rate with the USD. In order to convert these units to USD, the Company must obtain foreign currency resources from the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, which are subject to the monetary and exchange control policy in Zimbabwe. If the foreign exchange restrictions and government-imposed controls become severe, we may have to reassess our ability to control MTC.\nOur international operations are in areas where the demand is for the export of lower priced tobacco. We have significant investments in our purchasing, processing and exporting operations in Argentina, Brazil, Malawi, Tanzania and Turkey.\nIn recent years, economic problems in certain countries where we have international operations have received wide publicity related to devaluation and appreciation of the local currency and inflation, including the classification of the Argentina, Malawi, and Zimbabwe economies as highly inflationary. Devaluation and appreciation of the local currency and inflation can affect our purchase costs of tobacco and our processing costs. In addition, we conduct business with suppliers and customers in countries that have recently had or may be subject to dramatic political regime change. In the event of such dramatic changes in the government of such countries, we may be unable to continue to operate our business, or adequately enforce legal obligations, after the change in a manner consistent with prior practice.\nFailure of foreign banks in which our subsidiaries deposit funds or the failure to transfer funds or honor withdrawals may affect our results of operations.\nFunds held by our foreign subsidiaries are often deposited in their local banks. In addition, we maintain deposit accounts with numerous financial institutions around the world in amounts that exceed applicable governmental deposit insurance levels. Banks in certain foreign jurisdictions may be subject to a higher rate of failure or may not honor withdrawals of deposited funds. In addition, the countries in which these local banks operate may lack sufficient regulatory oversight or suffer from structural weaknesses in the local banking system. Due to uncertainties and risks relating to the political stability of certain foreign governments, these local banks also may be subject to exchange controls and therefore unable to perform transfers of certain currencies. If our ability to gain access to these funds was impaired, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and we operate in jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential FCPA violations.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and/or other benefits. We operate in a number of jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential FCPA violations. Although our corporate policy prohibits foreign bribery and we have adopted procedures to promote compliance, we cannot assure you that our policy or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under the FCPA for actions taken by our agents, employees, and intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we acquire. Failure to comply with the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities (including local laws) could lead to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures (including further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies, and controls, the imposition of a compliance monitor at our expense and potential personnel changes and/or disciplinary actions), any of which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws by U.S. or foreign authorities also could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn 2010, we entered into settlements with the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice to resolve their investigations regarding potential criminal and civil violations of the FCPA. The settlements resulted in the disgorgement in profits and fines totaling $19.45 million, which have been paid. Both settlements also required us to retain an independent compliance monitor for a three-year term that was completed September 30, 2013.\nOur exposure to foreign tax regimes, and changes in U.S. or foreign tax regimes, could adversely affect our business.\nWe do business in countries that have tax regimes in which the rules are not clear, are not consistently applied and are subject to sudden change. This is especially true with regard to international transfer pricing. Our earnings could be reduced by the uncertain and changing nature of these tax regimes. Certain of our subsidiaries are and may in the future be involved in tax matters in foreign countries. While the outcome of any of these existing matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we are vigorously defending them and do not currently expect that any of them will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position. However, should one or more of these matters be resolved in a manner adverse to our current expectation, the effect on our results of operations for a particular fiscal reporting period could be material.\nWe seek to optimize our tax footprint across all operations in U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions alike. These benefits are contingent upon existing tax laws and regulations in the U.S. and in the countries in which our international operations are located. Future changes in domestic or international tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe conduct our business in many countries around the world. Our business is generally conducted in USD, as is the business of the leaf tobacco industry as a whole. We generally must purchase tobacco in non-U.S. countries using local currency. As a result, local country operating costs, including the purchasing and processing costs for tobaccos, are subject to the effects of\nexchange fluctuations of the local currency against the USD. When the USD weakens against foreign currencies, our costs for purchasing and processing tobacco in such currencies increases. We attempt to minimize such currency risks by matching the timing of our working capital borrowing needs against the tobacco purchasing and processing funds requirements in the currency of the country where the tobacco is grown. Fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies can significantly affect our operating results.\nIn addition, the devaluation of foreign currencies has resulted and may in the future result in reduced purchasing power from customers whose capital resources are denominated in those currencies. We may incur a loss of business as a result of the devaluation of these currencies now or in the future.\nCompetition could erode our earnings.\nThe leaf tobacco industry is highly competitive. Competition is based primarily on the prices charged for products and services as well as the merchant\u2019s ability to meet customer specifications in the buying, processing, and financing of tobacco. In addition, there is competition in all countries to buy the available tobacco. The loss or substantial reduction of any large or significant customer could reduce our earnings.\nIn addition to the two primary global independent publicly held leaf tobacco merchants, the cigarette manufacturers increasingly buy tobacco directly from suppliers. We also face increasing competition from new local and regional independent leaf merchants with low fixed costs and overhead and good local customer connections, where the new entrants have been able to capitalize in the global transition to those markets. Any of these sources of new competition may result in less tobacco available for us to purchase and process in the applicable markets.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nWe have been and will likely continue to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic and its related impacts to our employees, operations, customers and suppliers.\nThe pandemic arising from the disease caused by the novel coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") has adversely affected, and is likely to continue to adversely affect, our businesses, and we have experienced and expect to continue to experience delays in shipments of leaf tobacco and other disruptions to our operations. Although, in many jurisdictions, our operations have been classified as \u201cessential\u201d under various governmental orders restricting business activities implemented in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, that classification has not been universal and we have been, and may in the future be, required to suspend operations at certain facilities as a result of similar governmental orders. We cannot predict whether our operations classified as \u201cessential\u201d will continue to be so classified or, even if so classified, whether site-specific health and safety concerns related to COVID-19 might otherwise require operations at any of our facilities to be halted for some period of time. Other operational disruptions may result from restrictions on the ability of employees and others in the supply chain to travel and work, such as caused by quarantine or individual illness, or which may result from border closures imposed by governments to deter the spread of COVID-19, or determinations by us or shippers to temporarily suspend operations in affected areas, or other actions which restrict the ability to ship our products or which may otherwise negatively impact our ability to ship our products. Ports or channels of entry may be closed, operate at only a portion of capacity or require quarantining of vessels, or transportation of products within a region or country may be limited, if workers are unable to report to work due to travel restrictions or personal illness. These factors have also impacted certain of our suppliers and we have been and will likely continue to be impacted by disruptions in the supply of certain materials used in our operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may further damage our business due to negative consumer purchasing behavior with respect to the products of our leaf tobacco customers and our other products. Public health officials around the world have recommended, and local, state, and national governments have mandated, precautions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including prohibitions on congregating in groups, shelter-in-place orders or similar measures. Consumer purchasing behavior may be impacted by reduced consumption by consumers who may not be able to leave home or otherwise shop in a normal manner as a result of these restrictions. In addition, in view of uncertainties with respect to the spread of COVID-19 and the duration and terms of related governmental orders restricting activities, we cannot predict whether demand for our products will persist at current levels or decrease on a global or regional basis.\nDue to the scope of our operations, including in emerging markets, and our sale to customers around the world, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and the demand for our products may not coincide with impacts experienced in the United States. Our operations in jurisdictions only recently experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks, such as portions of Africa and South America, may continue to be subject to governmental orders restricting activities after such governmental orders are lifted in the United States. Accordingly, to the extent that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States may improve over time, results of operations may continue to be adversely affected by COVID-19 impacts in other areas of the world.\nRisks Related to New Business Lines\nOur investments in new business lines as part of our expanded business strategy have been in companies with limited histories that are operating in newly developing markets and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\nOur investments, including indirect investments, in Figr East, Figr Norfolk, Criticality, Purilum, Nicotine River, and Humble Juice (collectively, the \"new business lines\") and the operation of these businesses, involve a high degree of risk. These investments are in businesses with limited operating histories and are dependent upon receipt of requisite licenses and approvals. We cannot assure you that as these operations further develop they will be profitable or otherwise sustainable. While certain of these businesses involve the cultivation and/or processing of agricultural products, similar in certain ways to leaf tobacco, and accordingly share commonality with our agronomy, traceability and agricultural product processing expertise, they are subject to commercial and regulatory challenges different from our leaf tobacco business and with respect to which we do not have the same level of experience. In addition, these businesses are subject to numerous additional risks and uncertainties, including those specified in the risk factors below.\nThe results of operations and financial position of the new business lines may differ materially from the expectations of\nthe Company's management.\nDue to numerous uncertainties, the results of operations, and financial position of the new business lines may differ materially from the expectations of the Company's management. The process for estimating the revenue, net income, and cash flow of the new business lines requires the use of judgment in determining the appropriate assumptions and estimates. These estimates and assumptions may be revised as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed. In addition, the assumptions used in planning may not prove to be accurate, and other factors may affect the financial condition or results of operations of the new business lines.\nGiven the rapid changes affecting global, national, and regional economies generally, including for example the economic decline associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the success of the new business lines will depend on the ability to respond to, among other things, changes in the economy, regulatory conditions, market conditions, and competitive pressures. Any failure to anticipate or respond adequately to such changes could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, operating results, liquidity, cash flow, and operational performance.\nThe Company expects to incur significant ongoing costs and obligations related to its investment in infrastructure, growth, regulatory compliance, and operations of the new business lines.\nThe Company expects to incur significant ongoing costs and obligations related to its investment in infrastructure and growth and for regulatory compliance with respect to the new business lines, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, future changes in regulations, changes in the enforcement thereof or other unanticipated events could require extensive changes to the Company's operations, increased compliance costs or give rise to material liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of the Company. Efforts to grow the business of the new business lines may be costlier than the Company expects, and the Company may not be able to increase its revenue enough to offset higher operating expenses. The new business lines may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the other risks described in this Form 10-K, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, and delays, and other unknown events.\nThe technologies, processes, and formulations used by the new business lines may face competition or become obsolete.\nRapidly changing markets, technology, emerging industry standards, and frequent introduction of new products characterize the new business lines. The introduction of new products embodying new technologies, including new manufacturing processes or formulations, and the emergence of new industry standards may render the new business lines\u2019 products obsolete, less competitive or less marketable. The process of developing the new business lines' products is complex and requires significant continuing costs, development efforts, and third-party commitments. The failure to develop new technologies and products and the obsolescence of existing technologies or processes could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations. The new business lines may be unable to anticipate changes in their respective potential customers' preferences that could make their existing technologies, processes or formulations obsolete. The success of the new business lines will depend in part on their ability to continue to enhance their existing technologies, develop new technologies that address the increasing sophistication and varied news of the market, and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost-effective basis. The development of the new business lines' proprietary technologies, processes and formulations entails significant technical and business risks. The new business lines may not be successful in using new technologies, exploiting niche markets effectively or adapting their respective businesses to evolving customer or medical requirements or preference or emerging industry standards.\nAs the markets in which the new business lines compete continue to develop, competition from market participants may have a negative impact on their business and prospects.\nThe markets in which the new business lines compete are competitive and are expected to become increasingly competitive. Certain of these competitors have significantly greater financial, production, marketing, research & development, technical, and\nhuman resources than the Company does. The commercial opportunity for the new business lines could be reduced or eliminated if their competitors produce and commercialize products that, among other things, are safer, more effective, more convenient or less expensive, have greater sales, marketing, and distribution support, enjoy enhanced timing of market introduction and perceived advantages of better effectiveness and receive more favorable publicity. As a result, these competitors may be more successful in gaining market penetration and market share. If the new business lines do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance in their respective markets, the new business lines may not generate sufficient revenue from their products, and their businesses may not become profitable.\nThe industries that the new business lines operate in are undergoing rapid growth and substantial change, which has resulted in an increase in competitors, consolidation and formation of strategic relationships, particularly with respect to legal adult-use cannabis products in Canada. Such acquisitions or other consolidating transactions could harm the Company in a number of ways, including by losing strategic partners if the partners are acquired by or enter into relationships with a competitor, losing customers, revenue and market share, or forcing the Company to expend greater resources to meet new or additional competitive threats, all of which could harm the operating results of the new business lines. As competitors enter the market and become increasingly sophisticated, this may intensify and place downward pressure on retail prices, which could negatively impact the profitability of the new business lines. To remain competitive while complying with regulatory requirements, the new business lines will require continued significant investment in research and development, marketing, sales, and customer support. The new business lines may not have sufficient resources to maintain research and development, marketing, sales and customer support efforts on a competitive basis, which could materially and adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\nFigr also faces competition from license holders authorized to produce cannabis under the Cannabis Act who may not fully comply with applicable regulations. Such producers may have lower operating costs, make impermissible claims and utilize other competitive advantages based on circumvention of regulatory requirements. Furthermore, Figr also faces competition from the illicit cannabis market. Illegal dispensaries and illicit operations and participants, despite not having a valid license under the Canadian Cannabis Regulations Act, may be able to: (i) offer products with higher concentrations of active ingredients than Figr is authorized to produce and sell; (ii) brand products more explicitly; (iii) sell products at lower prices; and (iv) market products in ways not permissible by law. As these illicit market participants do not comply with applicable regulations, their operations may also have significantly lower costs.\nAs the Canadian adult-use cannabis market continues to mature, consumers who once solely relied on the medical cannabis market may shift some, or all, of their consumption away from medical cannabis and towards adult-use cannabis, resulting in increased levels of competition in the adult-use cannabis market. The Cannabis Act allows individuals in Canada to cultivate, propagate, harvest and distribute up to four cannabis plants per household provided that each plant meets certain requirements. If Figr is unable to effectively compete with other suppliers to the adult-use cannabis market, or a significant number of individuals take advantage of the ability to cultivate and use their own cannabis, the success of Figr may be limited and may not fulfill the expectations of management.\nThe number of competitors in the hemp and CBD markets is expected to increase, both in the United States and internationally, which could negatively impact Criticality\u2019s market share and demand for its products. Additionally, the introduction of an adult-use model for non-hemp cannabis production and distribution in various jurisdictions may cause producers in those jurisdictions to expand beyond the medical cannabis market and compete with Criticality\u2019s hemp and CBD products. The impact of this potential development may be negative for Criticality and could result in increased levels of competition in its existing market and/or the entry of new competitors in the hemp market in which Criticality operates.\nAny failure by the new business lines to anticipate or respond adequately to such changes could have a material adverse effect on their respective financial condition, operation results, liquidity, cash flow, and operational performance.\nThe new business lines may be unable to obtain additional financial resources on favorable terms or at all.\nIf the new business lines are not able to reach or sustain profitability or if any requires additional capital to fund growth or other initiatives, they may require additional equity or debt financing. We cannot assure you that any new business line will be able to obtain additional financial resources on favorable commercial terms or at all. Failure to obtain such financial resources could affect the Company's plan for growth or result in the Company being unable to satisfy its obligations as they become due, either of which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\nChanging consumer preferences may adversely affect consumer retention and results of operations.\nAs a result of changing consumer preferences, many novel products, dietary supplements, and other innovative products attain financial success for a limited period of time. Even if the products of the new business lines find retail success, we cannot assure you that any of these products will continue to see extended financial success. The success of the new business lines will be significantly dependent upon their ability to develop new and improved product lines and to adapt to consumer preferences. Even if the new business lines are successful in introducing new products or developing current products, a failure to gain\nconsumer acceptance or to update products with compelling content could cause a decline in popularity of these products that could reduce revenues and harm the Company's brands, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nConsumer perception and reputational risk may negatively affect the new business lines.\nThe respective markets for the products of the new business lines are highly dependent upon consumer perception regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of their products. Consumer perception can be significantly influenced by scientific research or findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention and other publicity regarding the consumption of these products. We cannot assure you that future scientific research, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other research findings or publicity will be favorable to the these markets or any particular product, or consistent with currently held views. Future research reports, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other publicity that are perceived as less favorable than, or that question, earlier research reports, findings or publicity could have a material adverse effect on the respective industries and demand for the products of the new business lines, which could affect their businesses, results of operations and cash flows. This dependence upon consumer perception means that adverse scientific research reports, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other publicity, whether or not accurate or with merit, could have a material adverse effect on the new business lines and their respective business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, adverse publicity, reports or other media attention regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of these industries in general, or associating the consumption of these types of products with illness or other negative effects or events, could have a material adverse effect. Such adverse publicity reports or other media attention could arise even if the adverse effects associated with such products resulted from consumers' failure to consume such products legally, appropriately, or as directed. Any litigation that might affect consumer perception regarding the new business lines' products could take the form of class proceedings or individual proceedings.\nThere have been a number of highly publicized cases involving lung and other illness and deaths that appear to be related to vaporizer devices or products used in such devices. For example, in February 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (the \u201cCDC\u201d) reported that federal and state agencies were investigating an outbreak of over 2,807 lung injury cases involving patients from all 50 states and one U.S. territory, including 68 confirmed deaths. As a result of the outbreak or future developments related to potential health risks associated with vaping, governments and private sector parties initiated actions aimed at reducing the incidence of vaping and/or seeking to hold manufacturers of nicotine e-liquids, THC or CBD vapable oils, and other vaping products, responsible for the adverse health effects associated with the use of vaping products. As there has been a limited period of time to study the long-term effects of vaporizer use, there is limited data on the safety and health effects. If scientific or medical research ultimately determines that use of vaporizer devices poses a significant risk to health or safety, the demand for vaporizer products may decrease, and regulation of these products could become significantly more restricted. The composition of Canadian cannabis vaporizer products is already stringently regulated. For example, the federal government in Canada has limited the permissible ingredients in a cannabis vape product to (i) carrier substances, (ii) flavoring agents; and (iii) substances necessary to maintain the quality or stability of the product. Additionally, certain states and local governments have already implemented regulations that prohibit the sale of vaporizers, the sale of flavored products (including nicotine, non-nicotine, THC and CBD e-liquid, e-cigarette and other vaping products) or have implemented additional restrictions on the composition of the product. Additional states and localities may implement similar restrictions and the regulations may become more restrictive at the federal level. Additional or more restrictive regulatory changes may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nActions by the FDA and other federal, state, or local governments or agencies may impact consumers\u2019 acceptance of or access to nicotine e-liquids, THC or CBD vapable oils and other vaping products (for example, through product standards related to flavored products promulgated by the FDA), limit consumers\u2019 choices, delay or prevent the launch of new or modified products or products with claims of reduced risk, require the recall or other removal of products from the marketplace (for example, as a result of product contamination or regulations that ban certain flavors or ingredients), restrict communications to consumers, restrict the ability to differentiate products, create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain companies, impose additional manufacturing, labeling, or packaging requirements, interrupt manufacturing or otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business, or restrict or prevent the use of specified products in certain locations or the sale of products by certain retail establishments. Any one or more of these actions may have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nEntities with which the Company does business may cease to provide services to the Company or the new business lines.\nParties outside of the cannabis industry in Canada with which the Company does business may perceive that they are exposed to reputational risk as a result of Figr's cannabis business activities. For example, the Company could receive a notification from a financial institution advising it that the financial institution would no longer maintain banking relationships with those in the cannabis industry, even though the Company\u2019s involvement is through indirect, separately managed foreign subsidiaries. It is possible that the Company may in the future have difficulty establishing or maintaining bank accounts or other business relationships that it needs to operate its business. Failure to establish or maintain such business relationships could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company and its U.S. subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations related to money laundering, financial record keeping, and proceeds of crime and may be unable to receive any funds generated by Figr and such funds may not be used to fund the payment of obligations of our U.S. based operations.\nThe Company is subject to a variety of laws and regulations that involve money laundering, financial recordkeeping and proceeds of crime, including the U.S. Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (commonly known as the Bank Secrecy Act), as amended by Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act), the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (Canada), the Criminal Code (Canada), as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder, and any related or similar rules, regulations or guidelines, issued, administered or enforced by governmental authorities in the United States and Canada.\nFor example, under U.S. federal law, it is unlawful to engage in financial transactions involving the proceeds of unlawful activity, including the sale of controlled substances, which in the United States includes marijuana (i.e., cannabis plants, plant parts, or derivatives that do not qualify as either hemp, the mature stalks of non-hemp plants, the sterilized seeds of non-hemp plants, or derivatives or such mature stalks or seeds). Also under U.S. federal law, banks or other financial institutions that provide a marijuana-related business with a checking account, debit or credit card, small business loan, or any other service could be found guilty of money laundering, aiding and abetting a violation of federal law (e.g., the Controlled Substances Act), or conspiracy (e.g., to violate the Controlled Substances Act).\nThe Company does not believe any of its activities implicate any applicable money laundering, conspiracy, or related statutes. However, if any of the Company's investments, or any proceeds thereof, any dividends or distributions therefrom, or any profits or revenues accruing from such investments in the United States or Canada were found to be in violation of money laundering legislation or otherwise, such transactions may be viewed as proceeds of crime under one or more of the statutes noted above or any other applicable legislation and any persons found to be aiding and abetting or conspiring to commit such violations could be subject to liability. This could restrict or otherwise jeopardize the ability of Figr to declare or pay dividends, effect other distributions or otherwise repatriate funds to Pyxus or any Pyxus subsidiary in the United States. Accordingly, funds generated by Figr\u2019s operations, or in certain circumstances the potential future sale of either or both of Figr East and Figr Norfolk subsidiaries, may not be available to fund the payment of obligations of the Company\u2019s U.S. based operations, including the debt obligations of Pyxus.\nThe adult-use cannabis market in Canada has experienced, and may in the future experience, supply, and demand fluctuations.\nThere have been fluctuations in the supply and demand in the Canadian adult-use cannabis market since legalization in October 2018. If the inventory levels of Figr in the future become greater than consumer demand, they may have to engage in sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could significantly impair their brand image and reduce their net income, if any, or result in net losses. Conversely, if they underestimate demand for their products, they may experience inventory shortages, which might delay shipments to customers, reduce revenue, negatively impact customer relationships and diminish brand loyalty. In addition, demand for cannabis and cannabis products is dependent on a number of social, political and economic factors that are beyond their control, including the novelty of legalization, which may diminish over time. Market demand for cannabis may not continue to be sufficient to support the current or future production levels of Figr, and each may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to be profitable.\nDue to these fluctuations and uncertainties, the current market conditions in the cannabis industry generally, the ability to access financing due to both the market and the more recent economic downturn due to the COVID-19 pandemic, any expansion of Figr facilities is subject to significant risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are more pronounced in the cannabis industry, as not only must the license holder make significant capital investments in the plans and construction, any expansion plans must be applied for and approved by Health Canada. To date, Health Canada has been significantly delayed in both processing applications and approving license amendments required for expansions to facilities. Further, any contemplated facilities expansions may not be completed on schedule due to delays in construction, including delays in securing necessary funding, and may not receive necessary licenses and permits to permit operations to commence once construction is completed. In addition, Figr may not be able to attract and retain sufficiently qualified personnel to adequately staff the expanded facilities. It is also possible that any expansion plans may cost more than anticipated and need to be curtailed, or the timeframes for completion extended. Accordingly, Figr may not be successful in executing its strategy to expand production capacity at its facilities.\nThere are limited long-term data with respect to the efficacy and side effects of the new business lines\u2019 products, and future studies may lead to conclusions that dispute or conflict with the Company's understanding and belief regarding the benefits, viability, safety, efficacy, dosing and social acceptance of such products.\nIf the products of the new business lines are not perceived to have the effects intended by the end user, the Company's business may suffer. With the exception of nicotine, which is highly addictive, there are limited long-term data with respect to efficacy, unknown side effects and/or interaction of the substances contained in the products of the new business lines with human or\nanimal biochemistry. As a result, these products could have unexpected side effects, the discovery of which could materially and adversely affect the Company's, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn particular, the rapid development of nicotine e-liquids, THC or CBD vapable oils, and other vaping products has not provided sufficient time for the medical profession to study the long-term health effects of using such products. Therefore, it is uncertain as to whether or not nicotine e-liquids, THC or CBD vapable oils, and other vaping products are safe for their intended use. If the medical profession were to determine that using nicotine e-liquids, THC or CBD vapable oils, and other vaping products posed a significant threat to long-term human health, consumption could decline rapidly and the new business lines may be forced to modify certain or all of their respective, e-liquids, vapable oils, and other vaping products. Such an outcome may have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, and results of operations\nResearch in Canada, the United States, and internationally regarding the benefits, viability, safety, efficacy, dosing and social acceptance of cannabis or isolated cannabinoids, such as CBD and THC, remains in early stages. There have been relatively few studies conducted to determine the benefits, safety, and side effects of cannabis or isolated cannabinoids (such as CBD and THC). Although the Company believes that the articles, reports, and studies support its beliefs regarding the benefits, viability, safety, efficacy, dosing, and social acceptance of hemp and cannabis, future research and clinical trials may prove such articles, reports, and studies to be incorrect, or could raise concerns regarding cannabis, and perceptions relating to cannabis. Given these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, undue reliance should not be placed on such articles and reports.\nFuture research studies and clinical trials may draw opposing conclusions, or reach negative conclusions, regarding the benefits, viability, safety, efficacy, dosing, social acceptance, or other facts and perceptions related to cannabis and hemp use, which could have a material adverse effect on the demand for products containing THC or CBD with the potential to lead to a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nThe Company believes the hemp and CBD industries in the United States are highly dependent upon positive consumer perception regarding the safety, efficacy, and quality of hemp-derived products, as well as consumer views concerning regulatory compliance and perceived similarities or differences between hemp and marijuana. Consumers, vendors, landlords/lessors, industry partners, or third-party service providers may incorrectly perceive hemp products as marijuana thereby confusing them for having the high THC content of marijuana or for being controlled substances under U.S. federal law.\nThe new business lines are subject to risks related to the retail distribution of their respective products.\nRetail chains typically procure products in defined cycles depending on their internal procurement needs. If the new business lines (with the exception of Figr, as discussed below) are successful in obtaining retail distribution for their products, they will be subject to the cyclical nature of the procurement strategies of their respective retail partners.\nWhile the Canadian federal government regulates the cultivation and production of cannabis and authorizes distribution of cannabis, each province and territory regulates the wholesale and retail distribution of cannabis within their province or territory. In many provinces and territories, the provincial or territorial government has a monopoly over adult-use sales and thus Figr derives a significant portion of its revenue from supply agreements with provincial governments. In the context of brick and mortar retail, most provinces and territories allow private parties to apply for retail licenses, however, these private sector retailers are required to purchase products from the applicable provincial or territorial government and thus Figr can sell its products only to the provincial or territorial government. A small number of provinces do allow for direct sales by federally licensed producers to retailers. In all cases, in order for Figr to be able to sell its products it must apply to the applicable provincial or territorial government and complete the onboarding process which varies from one provincial or territorial government to the next and, in some cases, is quite onerous and more akin to licensing. In addition, and once approved, Figr must abide by the applicable rules, policies and regulations of the applicable provincial or territorial government, which are subject to change any time.\nCurrently, Figr Norfolk does not have any supply agreements with provincial or territorial governments. Figr East has secured supply agreements or arrangements with the provinces of Ontario, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick and has initiated the process of securing supply agreements with Alberta, Quebec and Manitoba. We cannot assure you that Figr East will obtain supply agreements or arrangements with the provinces of Alberta, Quebec, and Manitoba, or any other province or territory. While Figr East is authorized to sell product in Saskatchewan, it has yet to sell any product in this province. Generally, provincial supply agreements or other supply arrangements do not contain purchase commitments or otherwise obligate provincial distributors to buy a minimum or fixed volume of products. As a result, the amount of cannabis that these provincial distributors may purchase under supply agreements or other arrangements, or its price, may deviate significantly from the Company's desires or expectations. In addition, revenues could fluctuate materially in the future and could be materially and disproportionately impacted by the purchasing decisions of existing government purchasers and any other future government purchasers. If any of the existing purchasers decides to purchase lower volumes of products than expected, insist on a price that is lower than expected, alter its purchasing patterns at any time with limited notice,\ndecide not to continue or begin to purchase the Figr East cannabis products at all or do not enter into or renew supply agreement with Figr East on similar terms or other terms acceptable to them, Figr East's revenues could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s new business lines may be unable to maintain or promote the reputation of their respective brands or may incur excessive expense in doing so.\nManagement believes that maintaining and promoting the respective brands of the new business lines is critical to expanding their respective customer bases. Maintaining and promoting such brands will depend largely on the ability of new business lines to continue to provide quality, reliable and innovative products, which they may not do successfully. In addition, any introduction of new products or services that their respective customers do not like, which may negatively affect their respective brand and reputation. Maintaining and enhancing these brands may require substantial investments, and these investments may not achieve the desired goals. Further, the restriction on the use of logos and brand names on cannabis products could have a material adverse impact on the business, financial condition, and results of operations of Figr, as it may be difficult to establish brand loyalty.\nThe future growth and profitability of the new business lines will depend on the effectiveness and efficiency of advertising and promotional expenditures with respect to their products, including the ability to: (i) create greater awareness of the products; (ii) determine the appropriate creative message and media mix for future advertising expenditures; and (iii) effectively manage advertising and promotional costs in order to maintain acceptable operating margins. We cannot assure you that advertising and promotional expenditures will result in revenues in the future or will generate awareness of these products or services. In addition, the plain packaging requirements and restrictions or promotion of the Canadian cannabis regulatory regime combined with the oversight of Criticality\u2019s and Purilum's operations in the United States by the FTC and FDA may limit the ability to effectively advertise and promote these products. We cannot assure you that the new business lines will be able to manage their respective advertising and promotional expenditures on a cost-effective basis.\nThe new business lines are heavily dependent on their respective intellectual property and trade secrets. If they are unable to effectively defend their respective intellectual property and trade secrets, their respective image, brand or competitive position may be harmed.\nThe success of the new business lines is heavily dependent upon their respective intangible property and technology. The new business lines rely upon copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing innovation to protect important intangible property, technology and information. The Company relies on various methods to protect its proprietary rights, including confidentiality agreements with consultants, service providers and management that contain terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized use and disclosure of confidential information. However, despite efforts to protect intangible property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or replicate intangible property, technology or processes. We cannot assure you that the steps taken by the new business lines to protect their intangible property, technology and information will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or independent third-party development of the new business lines' intangible property, technology or processes. Other companies may also be able to materially duplicate Figr's proprietary plant strains.\nWith respect to any intangible property rights claim against a new business line, the Company may have to pay damages or the new business line may be forced to stop using intangible property found to be in violation of a third party's rights. Such new business line may have to seek a license for the intangible property, which may not be available on reasonable terms and may significantly increase operating expenses. The technology also may not be available for license at all. As a result, the new business line may also be required to pursue alternative options, which could require significant effort and expense. If the new business line cannot license or obtain an alternative for the infringing aspects of its business, it may be forced to limit product offerings and may be unable to compete effectively. Any of these results could harm the Company's brand and prevent it from generating sufficient revenue or achieving profitability.\nTo the extent that any of the above occur, revenue could be negatively affected, and in the future, the Company may have to litigate to enforce its intangible property rights, which could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention and other resources.\nEach of the new business lines' ability to successfully implement its business plan depends in part on its ability to obtain, maintain and build brand recognition using its trademarks, service marks, trade dress, domain names and other intellectual property rights. If their efforts to protect their intellectual property are unsuccessful or inadequate, or if any third-party misappropriates or infringes on their intellectual property, the value of their brands may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on their business and might prevent their brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance.\nThe industries in which the new business lines operate are highly regulated and the Company may not always succeed in complying fully with applicable regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where the Company carries on business.\nThe Company's new business lines are heavily regulated in all jurisdictions where they carry on business. For example, Figr's operations are subject to various laws, regulations, and guidelines by governmental authorities (including Health Canada)\nrelating to the manufacture, marketing, management, transportation, storage, sale, pricing, and disposal of cannabis and cannabis oil, and also including laws and regulations relating to health and safety, insurance coverage, the conduct of operations, and the protection of the environment. Additionally, certain activities of the new business lines are legally permissible only in select jurisdictions or pursuant to select specified regulations and restrictions. For example, while Canadian national and provincial law authorizes the cultivation and sale of cannabis subject to regulatory requirements, United States federal law prohibits the cultivation and sale of non-hemp cannabis. Similarly, the cultivation and sale of industrial hemp or hemp in the United States is governed by a patchwork of federal, state, and local regulations, including without limitation the 2014 Farm Bill, the 2018 Farm Bill, the USDA interim final rule, state agricultural pilot program requirements, and state commercial hemp plans. Laws and regulations, applied generally, grant government agencies and self-regulatory bodies broad administrative discretion over such activities, including the power to limit or restrict business activities as well as impose additional disclosure requirements on these products and services.\nThe Company intends to pursue the new business lines only in the jurisdictions where legal, and only to the extent permitted by applicable law and regulation. Among other things, the Company does not intend to grow, cultivate, manufacture, or distribute non-hemp cannabis in the United States, or to export any cannabis grown, or cannabis products manufactured, in Canada to the United States, while such activities remain illegal under United States federal law. However, any failure to comply with the regulatory requirements applicable to the operations of the new business lines may lead to civil, criminal, and/or administrative enforcement actions, which could result in possible penalties and other sanctions for the Company, its officers, directors, and/or other parties, including but not limited to, the revocation or imposition of additional conditions on licenses to operate; the suspension or expulsion from a particular market or jurisdiction or of key personnel; the imposition of additional or more stringent inspection, testing and reporting requirements; the imposition of fines and censures; and the cessation of business activities, each of such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, changes in regulations, more vigorous enforcement thereof or other unanticipated events could require extensive changes to operations, increase compliance costs or give rise to material liabilities or a revocation of licenses and other permits, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, governmental authorities may change their administration, application, or enforcement procedures at any time, which may adversely impact the ongoing costs relating to regulatory compliance.\nThe industry and the regulations governing adult-use cannabis in Canada are rapidly developing, and if they develop in ways that differ from the Company\u2019s expectations, its business and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nThe Cannabis Act federally legalized adult-use (non-medical) cannabis in Canada effective as of October 17, 2018. Under the Cannabis Act, each province and territory of Canada has the ability to separately regulate the distribution and sale of adult-use cannabis within such province or territory, and the laws (including associated regulations) adopted by each province and territory may vary significantly. Each Canadian province and territory has enacted and implemented regulatory regimes for the distribution and sale of cannabis for adult use. Regulations continue to be promulgated and amended. There is no guarantee that federal, provincial and territorial legislation regulating the production, distribution and sale and promotion of cannabis for adult use, or the application and enforcement of such legislation, will not change in the future or that its interpretation by the applicable regulatory and judicial bodies will not differ from that of the Company. Any such change or difference in interpretation could result in significant additional compliance or other costs and may make participation in such markets uneconomical. Since cannabis for adult use was only recently legalized in Canada, there may be inconsistencies in the interpretation and enforcement of the Cannabis Act and associated provincial and territorial rules and regulations. At the federal level, there are limitations on sales and marketing activities, the packaging of cannabis products and use of branding and other promotional activities. The provinces and territories have also imposed certain restrictions that are more stringent than the federal rules or regulations, such as bans on certain products, raising minimum age of purchase and flavor restrictions. In addition, Health Canada has experienced delays in approving applications for new licenses, capacity expansions and security clearances required under the Cannabis Act, including with respect to Figr. Any inconsistencies in the interpretation and enforcement of the Cannabis Act, changes or delays could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn October 2019, new regulations permitting and governing the production, distribution, promotion and sale of edible cannabis, cannabis extracts and topical cannabis came into effect. Uncertainty remains, however, with respect to the implementation of regulations under the Cannabis Act that will govern the sale and use of cannabis-related products as well as the various provincial and territorial regimes governing the distribution and sale of cannabis for adult-use purposes. The impact of these laws, regulations and guidelines on Figr, including increased costs of compliance and other potential risks remain uncertain and, accordingly, may cause Figr to experience adverse effects on their business, financial condition and results of operations. In Canada, the federal and provincial or territorial legislation and regulatory regimes for cannabis products also include excise duties payable by licensed cannabis producers on adult-use cannabis products, in addition to goods and services tax or harmonized sales tax in certain provinces and territories. The rate of the excise duties for cannabis products varies by province and territory. Any significant increase in the rate of excise duties on adult-use cannabis products in the future could reduce consumer demand for adult-use cannabis products and adversely impact the adult-use cannabis industry and market in general.\nIn addition, any increase in the rate of excise duties on cannabis products in the future could reduce the margins and profitability of Figr.\nThe Canadian federal regulatory regime includes plain packaging requirements. Among other things, the packaging of cannabis products may only display the brand name once on each principal display panel in prescribed font and size and only one other brand element, such as a logo, may be displayed in addition to the brand name. Further, the packaging and promotion of cannabis products must not be appealing to youth.\nIn addition, the Cannabis Act allows for licenses to be granted for outdoor cultivation and Health Canada commenced granting outdoor cultivation licenses in May 2019. The implications of permitting outdoor cultivation are not yet known, but outdoor cultivation could reduce start-up capital required for new entrants in the cannabis industry, or permit lower cost expansions by existing industry participants as capital expenditure requirements related to outdoor growing are typically much lower than those associated with indoor growing. Similarly, it may also ultimately lower prices. Accordingly, competition from firms holding outdoor cultivation licenses may have a material adverse impact on the business, financial condition, and results of operation of Figr.\nChanges to these laws or regulations could negatively affect the competitive position of Figr within its industry and the markets in which it operates, and we cannot assure you that various levels of government in the jurisdictions in which Figr operates will not pass legislation or regulations that adversely impact their business.\nThe new business lines are reliant on obtaining and maintaining licenses, authorizations, approvals, and permits for each of its businesses.\nEach of the new business lines will be required to obtain and maintain certain licenses, approvals and permits in the jurisdictions where their products are produced, licensed or sold. There are also certain approvals and clearances required for directors, officers, parent corporations and any individual in a position to exercise control over Figr. We cannot assure you that the Company will be able to obtain or maintain all necessary licenses, approvals and permits or be able to obtain them on a timely basis. Failure to obtain such licenses, permits or approvals may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCriticality may be required to submit a New Dietary Ingredient (\"NDI\") notification to the FDA with respect to hemp extracts. This could depend on whether Criticality can establish that a particular extract was marketed as a dietary ingredient in a dietary supplement prior to October 15, 1994, or is otherwise currently in the food supply in the same chemical form as used in its dietary supplement product. If the FDA objects to Criticality's NDI notification, this would have a materially adverse effect upon Criticality and its business.\nFurther, the FDA\u2019s current compliance policy generally requires that the Company file PMTAs for its finished nicotine-containing e-liquid products by September 9, 2020, or remove them from the market. The Company intends to file PMTAs for certain products by such date. In the event that these applications are not timely submitted or approved, the Company may be required to remove these products from the market.\nThe Company is subject to uncertainty regarding legal and regulatory status and changes.\nAchievement of the Company's business objectives is contingent, in part, upon compliance by the new business lines with regulatory requirements enacted by governmental authorities. The new business lines will incur ongoing costs and obligations related to regulatory compliance. Failure to comply with regulations may result in additional costs for corrective measures, penalties or in restrictions on operations. In addition, changes in regulations or in interpretations of existing regulations, more vigorous enforcement thereof or other unanticipated events could require extensive changes to operations, increased compliance costs or give rise to material liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of the Company.\nCriticality is subject to uncertainty regarding the legal and regulatory status of hemp, including with respect to U.S. federal and state implementation of the 2018 Farm Bill and related laws, and changes to such laws and regulations may have material adverse effects on the operations of Criticality.\nAs discussed in Item 1, \u201cBusiness-Operations of New Business Lines-Industrial Hemp-Regulation\u201d of this Form 10-K, there is significant uncertainty concerning the permissible scope of commercial activity involving industrial hemp, hemp, and hemp-derived products including CBD, as well as the timing and manner of implementation of relevant regulations. The 2014 Farm Bill only authorized institutions of higher education and state agriculture departments to cultivate industrial hemp, and only to do so for research purposes. However, it also gave significant discretion to states to regulate industrial hemp pilot programs. Many states that have adopted pilot programs have registered private companies to cultivate and process industrial hemp. Additionally, many states, including North Carolina, where Criticality is based, have interpreted the 2014 Farm Bill to permit marketing research concerning industrial hemp through, among other things, commercial marketing and sale of industrial hemp and industrial hemp products. In contrast, the DEA, FDA, and USDA have taken the position that, under the\n2014 Farm Bill, industrial hemp products may not be sold for the purpose of general commercial activity or in states without agricultural pilot programs that permit their sale for research marketing purposes. These agencies have also taken the position that, under the 2014 Farm Bill, industrial hemp plants and seeds may not be transported across state lines; although the USDA\u2019s general counsel has issued a legal opinion that interstate shipment of hemp is permitted under the 2014 Farm Bill, not all of the agencies may agree. There is evidence that Congress does not agree with these agencies\u2019 interpretation of the 2014 Farm Bill, including through its insertion in various appropriations bills language prohibiting the DEA from using funds to impede state agricultural pilot programs. However, we cannot assure you that such language will be inserted in future appropriations bills while industrial hemp cultivation continues to be governed by the 2014 Farm Bill. We cannot assure you that these agencies will change their position concerning the permissible scope of commercial activity under the 2014 Farm Bill.\nThe 2018 Farm Bill, among other things, removes \"hemp\" and its derivatives (including its cannabinoids, such as CBD) from the Controlled Substances Act and amends the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to provide for commercial production of hemp in the United States. The passage of the 2018 Farm Bill and the promulgation on October 31, 2019 by the USDA of an interim final rule under the 2018 Farm Bill did not eliminate the uncertainty surrounding the permissible scope of commercial activity involving hemp and hemp products. As of May 27, 2020, the USDA had approved commercial hemp plans for only seventeen states, thirty-two tribes, and one territory. In states without approved plans (and for individual growers in those states who have not received federal licenses from the USDA), cultivation of industrial hemp continues to be governed by the more restrictive 2014 Farm Bill and applicable states\u2019 agricultural pilot program requirements, and commercial production of hemp may violate federal law.\nFurther, there is uncertainty concerning the timing and manner of implementation of the 2018 Farm Bill in each state. Under the interim final rule, each state may choose if and when to submit a plan for USDA approval. Until a plan is approved for a growing state, commercial hemp production may not legally begin under the 2018 Farm Bill under state authority in that state. By way of example, in North Carolina, where Criticality is based, legislation authorizing a state plan was introduced but did not pass in the last legislative session, there has been no proposed state plan, and the NC Hemp Commission has expressed its opposition to operating under the existing interim final regulations. In contrast, other states (including South Carolina, from which Criticality sources hemp) have approved plans and growers operating under the 2018 Farm Bill. Moreover, individual growers (including some from which Criticality purchases) may choose to apply for a federal license and be governed by the 2018 Farm Bill.\nAdditionally, there is uncertainty created by the 2018 Farm Bill\u2019s decision to leave the states as potential primary regulators of hemp production. States may adopt regulatory schemes that impose different levels of regulation and costs on the production of hemp. Because many states have not yet obtained USDA approval for plans for commercial hemp production, the timing of the adoption of state plans cannot be assured. Moreover, the 2018 Farm Bill provides that its provisions do not preempt or limit state laws that regulate the production of hemp. Accordingly, some states may choose to restrict or prohibit some or all hemp production or sales. For example, in North Carolina, where Criticality is based, the state legislature previously considered legislation that would have treated \u201csmokeable hemp\u201d (defined as \"harvested raw or dried hemp plant material, including hemp buds or hemp flowers, hemp cigars, and hemp cigarettes\") as illegal marijuana under state law unless produced and used in compliance with specified requirements.\nIn addition, the status of the current regulations as an interim final rule creates uncertainty as to the ultimate regulatory structure for commercial hemp production. The current regulations are temporarily in place, pending public notice and comment on the regulations. The USDA has received comments on the interim final rule, including critical comments from the NC Hemp Commission. The USDA may make substantive changes in the regulations when final regulations are approved, and, indeed, has already suggested certain potential changes. The interim final rule is set to expire on November 1, 2021, unless extended, to provide time for a full rulemaking procedure. There is uncertainty what the final rules will be, if any, after the rulemaking procedure, and when they will be adopted.\nFurther, under the 2018 Farm Bill, the FDA has retained authority over Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act-regulated products containing hemp and its derivatives, including CBD. Moreover, states have retained regulatory authority through their own analogues to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and the states may diverge from the federal treatment of the use of hemp as, or in, food, dietary supplements, vapable products, or topical cosmetic products. We cannot assure you that the FDA or states (under their Controlled Substances Act and Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act analogues) will ultimately permit the sale of non-pharmaceutical products containing hemp-derived CBD.\nChanges in the regulations governing cannabis outside of Canada may adversely impact the Company's prospects.\nThe Company's growth strategy with respect to international expansion of the new business lines continues to evolve as regulations governing the medical cannabis and industrial hemp industries in the foreign jurisdictions become more fully developed. Interpretation of these laws, rules, regulations, and their application is ongoing. New laws, regulations, and guidelines may be enacted and enforced or existing laws, regulations, and guidelines may be interpreted or applied in a manner that could limit or curtail the new business lines expansion plans. Amendments to current laws, regulations and guidelines,\nmore stringent implementation or enforcement thereof, enactment of new laws, the adoption of new regulations, or other unanticipated events, including changes in political regimes and attitudes toward cannabis and industrial hemp, are beyond the Company's control and could materially adversely affect the Company's international growth prospects.\nFurthermore, additional countries continue to pass laws that allow for the production and distribution of cannabis in one form or another. International competition and limitations placed on Figr by Canadian regulations might lower the demand for any future Figr products on a global scale.\nAmendments to current laws, regulations, and guidelines, more stringent implementation or enforcement thereof or other unanticipated events, including changes in political regimes and attitudes toward the new business lines, are beyond the Company's control and could require extensive changes to the Company's international operations, which in turn may result in a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot assure you that the Company will be able to expand cannabis operations into legal jurisdictions outside of Canada, or to expand its industrial hemp operations into other states or internationally, and any such expansion will be subject to risks.\nWe cannot assure you that any market for cannabis products to be offered by subsidiaries of the Company will develop in any jurisdiction outside of Canada. Laws, regulations, and perceptions pertaining to cannabis vary widely internationally, and the scope or pace of legalization of medical and adult-use cannabis cannot be predicted or assured.\nSimilarly, we cannot assure you that the Company will be able to obtain the licenses, approvals and authorizations necessary to source industrial hemp from growers located in and operating under the agricultural pilot programs of states other than Colorado, New York, North Carolina, and Virginia, or to source hemp under the 2018 Farm Bill from growers operating under approved state plans (including but not limited to the South Carolina plan) or under the USDA\u2019s umbrella plan available to individual growers in states without approved plans. We cannot assure you that United States federal or state legislation regulating the distribution and sale of industrial hemp and hemp will remain unchanged, will be implemented in a way that is favorable to the Company, or will permit the commercial sale of hemp and hemp products nationally or internationally. If and when additional legal markets for cannabis develop, or the Company is able to expand its industrial hemp operations, the Company\u2019s pursuit of such markets may expose it to new or unexpected risks or significantly increase its exposure to one or more existing risk factors, including economic instability, changes in laws and regulations and the effects of competition. These factors may limit the Company's capability to successfully expand the operations of its subsidiaries into such jurisdictions and may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company will become subject to further laws and regulations as it expands internationally.\nThe Company may expand the new business lines internationally. If such international expansion occurs, the Company would become subject to the laws and regulations of (as well as international treaties among) the foreign jurisdictions in which it operates or imports or exports products or materials. In addition, the Company may avail itself of proposed legislative changes in certain jurisdictions to expand its product portfolio, which expansion may include business and regulatory compliance risks as yet undetermined. Failure by the Company to comply with the current or evolving regulatory framework in any jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations. There is the possibility that any such international jurisdiction could determine that the Company was not or is not compliant with applicable local regulations. If the Company's historical or current sales or operations were found to be in violation of such international regulations the Company may be subject to enforcement actions in such jurisdictions including, but not limited to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of the Company's operations or asset seizures and the denial of regulatory applications, each of such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nViolations of applicable law by Figr, including an unlawful transfer of cannabis inventory to jurisdictions, including the United States, in which the sale of such product is unlawful or within Canada other than for permitted use, may subject the Company to potential criminal sanctions.\nFigr is required to comply concurrently with a variety of complex federal, state or provincial, and local laws in each jurisdiction where it operates, or to which it exports or proposes to export its products, including laws and regulations relating to health and safety, conduct, or operations and the production, management, transportation, storage, and disposal of our products and of certain material used in our operations. These laws change frequently and may be difficult to interpret and apply. Compliance with these laws and regulations requires the investment of significant financial and managerial resources, and a determination that we are not in compliance with these laws and regulations could harm our brand image and business. Moreover, it is impossible for the Company to predict the cost or effect of such laws, regulations or guidelines upon its future operations.\nUnder current U.S. federal law, it is unlawful to operate a business from the U.S. that engages in the possession, manufacture, distribution, and/or sale of a controlled substance, including cannabis, in a foreign country where such activities are illegal. Although the Company anticipates that Figr will take precautions to ensure that their operations remain in compliance with all\nCanadian laws that might apply to such operations, operational decisions of Figr will be made by personnel not located in the United States, and funding of Figr, to the extent any additional funding is required, would be made by subsidiaries not located in the United States, there is a risk that if Figr were to violate Canadian federal, provincial or local law with respect to the manufacture, distribution, and/or sale of cannabis, including an unlawful transfer of cannabis inventory to jurisdictions, including the United States, in which the sale of such product is unlawful or within Canada other than for permitted use, that may subject the Company, its officers, directors, and other parties to potential criminal sanctions, civil fines, forfeitures, and other penalties in the United States.\nFurther, under current U.S. law, it is unlawful to import controlled substances, including marijuana (that is, cannabis plants, plant parts, or derivatives that do not qualify as either hemp, the mature stalks of non-hemp plants, the sterilized seeds of non-hemp plants, or derivatives of such mature stalks or seeds), into the United States, or to transport controlled substances through U.S. territorial waters, on U.S. flagged vessels and U.S. registered aircraft, or accompanied by U.S. citizens or resident aliens. Accordingly, there is a risk that if Figr were to violate U.S. federal or state law with respect to the manufacture, distribution, sale and/or transport of cannabis, even outside the United States, that may subject the Company to potential criminal sanctions, civil fines, forfeitures, and other penalties in the United States.\nThe presence of THC in Criticality\u2019s CBD products may cause adverse consequences to users of such products that will expose it to the risk of liability and other consequences.\nCriticality\u2019s products are made from industrial hemp, which contains THC, though typically at a low level. As a result of the variability of agricultural products, certain of Criticality\u2019s products contain varying levels of THC. THC is an illegal or controlled substance in many jurisdictions. Whether or not ingestion of THC (at low levels or otherwise) is permitted in a particular jurisdiction, there may be adverse consequences to end users who test positive for THC attributed to use of Criticality\u2019s products through unintentional presence in its products of THC, even if only in trace amounts. In addition, certain metabolic processes in the body may negatively affect the results of drug tests. Positive tests may adversely affect the end user\u2019s reputation, ability to obtain or retain employment and participation in certain athletic or other activities. A claim or regulatory action against Criticality based on such positive test results could materially adversely affect its reputation, potentially expose it to material liability and potentially require it to recall its products.\nEach of the new business lines faces inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims, regulatory action, and litigation if its products are alleged to have caused significant loss, injury, or death, which is exacerbated by the fact that cannabis use may increase the risk of serious adverse side effects.\nAs a manufacturer and distributor of products which are ingested or otherwise consumed by humans, each of the new business lines faces the risk of exposure to product liability claims, regulatory action and litigation (including class proceedings and individual proceedings) if its products are alleged to have caused loss, injury or death. Each of the new business lines may be subject to these types of claims due to allegations that its products caused or contributed to injury, illness or death, made false, misleading or impermissible claims, failed to include adequate labelling and instructions for use or failed to include adequate warnings concerning possible side effects or interactions with other substances. This risk is exacerbated for Figr by the fact that cannabis use may increase the risk of developing schizophrenia and other psychoses, symptoms for individuals with bipolar disorder, and other side effects. Previously unknown adverse reactions resulting from human consumption of the products of the new business lines alone or in combination with other medications or substances could also occur. In addition, the manufacture and sale of any ingested or consumable product, involves a risk of injury to consumers due to tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination. Any of the new business lines may in the future have to recall certain of its products as a result of potential contamination and quality assurance concerns. A product liability claim or regulatory action against any of the new business lines could result in increased costs and could adversely affect its reputation and goodwill with its consumers. We cannot assure you that product liability insurance can be maintained on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Such insurance is expensive and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. The inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage on reasonable terms or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could result in the Company becoming subject to significant liabilities that are uninsured and also could adversely affect commercial arrangements between the new business lines and third parties.\nThe risk of class-based litigation (and individual litigation) for manufacturers and distributors of cannabis and nicotine e-liquids, THC or CBD vapable oils and other vaping products, and others involved in the cannabis, hemp and vaping markets, is significant, particularly in the face of increasing health and marketing concerns, the potential for product recalls or other product-related issues. Both the United States and Canada have highly active plaintiffs\u2019 bars. Recent years have seen an increasing number of purported class action lawsuits in the United States against manufacturers and distributors of nicotine e-liquids, THC or CBD vapable oils and other vaping and CBD products. Canada, including each of its provinces and territories, generally has a low bar to class certification and is viewed as a highly plaintiff-friendly jurisdiction. These circumstances create enhanced risk and exposure for the Company given the nature of its operations, the products it manufactures, distributes and sells, and its business environment.\nSome of the inventory of the new business lines, including cannabis and hemp, is subject to possible write-offs.\nThe new business lines intend to hold finished goods in inventory and such inventory have a limited shelf life. Finished goods in inventory may include cannabis, cannabis products, and hemp products. Even though it is the intention of management to review the amount of inventory on hand in the future, write-off of inventory may still be required. Any such write-off of inventory could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company could incur substantial liability that may not be covered by insurance.\nThe Company has insurance to protect its assets, operations and employees. While the Company believes its insurance coverage addresses all material risks to which it is exposed and is adequate and customary in its current state of operations, such insurance is subject to coverage limits and exclusions and may not be available for the risks and hazards to which the Company is exposed. In addition, we cannot assure you that such insurance will be adequate to cover the Company's liabilities or will be generally available in the future or, if available, that premiums will be commercially justifiable. If the Company were to incur substantial liability and such damages were not covered by insurance or were in excess of policy limits, or if the Company were to incur such liability at a time when it is not able to obtain liability insurance, its business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nIn particular, due to the Company's involvement in the new business lines, it may have a difficult time obtaining the various insurances that are desired to operate its business, which may expose the Company to additional risk and financial liability. Insurance that is otherwise readily available, such as general liability, and directors and officer's insurance, may be more difficult to find, and more expensive, because of the regulatory regime applicable to the industry. There are no guarantees that the Company will be able to find such insurance coverage in the future, or that the cost will be affordable. If the Company is forced to go without such insurance coverage, it may prevent it from entering into certain business sectors, may inhibit growth, and may expose the Company to additional risk and financial liabilities.\nThe Company could incur unexpected expenses due to product recalls and any legal proceedings that may arise in connection with product recalls.\nManufacturers and distributors of products are sometimes subject to the recall or return of their products for a variety of reasons, including product defects, such as contamination, unintended harmful side effects or interactions with other substances, packaging safety and inadequate or inaccurate labeling disclosure. If any of the Company's products, including the new business lines, are recalled due to an alleged product defect or for any other reason, the Company could be required to incur the unexpected expense of the recall and any legal proceedings that might arise in connection with the recall. The Company may lose a significant amount of sales and may not be able to replace those sales at an acceptable margin or at all. In addition, a product recall may require significant attention from management. Although the Company has detailed procedures in place for testing its products, we cannot assure you that any quality, potency or contamination problems will be detected in time to avoid unforeseen product recalls, regulatory action or lawsuits. Additionally, if one of the products produced by the Company were subject to recall, the image and reputation of that product and the Company as a whole could be harmed. A recall for any of the foregoing reasons could lead to decreased demand for the Company's products and could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition and reputation of the Company.\nAdditionally, product recalls may lead to increased scrutiny of the Company's operations by applicable regulatory agencies, requiring further management attention and potential legal fees and other expenses.\nHemp plants are vulnerable to specific agricultural risks that may have a material adverse effect on the Company's hemp-related operations.\nHemp plants can be vulnerable to various pathogens including bacteria, fungi, viruses and other miscellaneous pathogens. Such instances often lead to reduced crop quality, stunted growth and/or death of the plant. Moreover, hemp is phytoremediative meaning that it may extract toxins or other undesirable chemicals or compounds from the ground in which it is planted. Various regulatory agencies have established maximum limits for pathogens, toxins, chemicals and other compounds that may be present in agricultural materials. If the hemp acquired by the Company for supply to Criticality is found to have levels of pathogens, toxins, chemicals, or other undesirable compounds that exceed established limits, the Company may have to destroy the applicable portions of its hemp crop and has been required to do so in the past. Should the crops be lost due to pathogens, toxins, chemicals or other undesirable compounds, it may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and financial condition.\nThe Company's cannabis production estimates are based on assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate.\nThe Company's estimated annual production of cannabis is based on estimated square footage of cultivation space and the amount of dried cannabis cultivated per plant, which is derived from the historical output of the existing Figr facilities. If Figr is unable to develop the predicted cultivation space, cultivate the predicted amount of cannabis, or obtain the necessary regulatory approvals, annual cannabis production may be less than predicted, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, and results of operations.\nA change in control of the Company, including in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, may affect Figr\u2019s ability to continue to sell its products in certain provinces in Canada.\nUpon change in control of Pyxus, which will occur upon consummation of the Plan, Figr may be required to notify certain Canadian provincial governments with which it has entered into supply agreements. While the Company does not believe that such a change of control in and of itself will give rise to a termination right of such provincial governments, due to the wide range of rights afforded to the provincial governments under these contracts, there is a risk that such provincial governments may terminate the supply agreements under their general termination rights or cease ordering product from Figr. In addition, in the event that any such change-in-control transaction also resulted in any change to the directors or officers of Figr, that the new directors and officers will be required to obtain security clearance from Health Canada in order to hold such positions in accordance with the Cannabis Regulations. Obtaining security clearance requires a thorough background check by Health Canada and is a prolonged process. Any delays in obtaining required security clearances, may have a material impact on the business and operations of Figr.\nRisks Relating to Other Aspects of Our Operations\nLow investment performance by our defined benefit pension plan assets may increase our pension expense, and may require us to fund a larger portion of our pension obligations, thus, diverting funds from other potential uses.\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover certain eligible employees. Our pension expense and required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of return on plan assets, and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure the defined benefit pension plan obligations.\nIf plan assets perform below the assumed rate of return used to determine pension expense, future pension expense will increase. Further, as a result of the global economic instability or other economic market events, our pension plan investment portfolio may experience significant volatility.\nThe proportion of pension assets to liabilities, which is called the funded status, determines the level of contribution to the plan that is required by law. In recent years, we have funded the plan in amounts as required, but changes in the plan\u2019s funded status related to the value of assets or liabilities could increase the amount required to be funded. We cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will further increase our pension funding obligations, diverting funds that would otherwise be available for other uses.\nWe rely on internal and externally hosted information technology systems and disruption, failure, or security breaches of these systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on information technology (\"IT\") systems, including systems hosted by service providers. The enterprise resource planning system (\"SAP\") we have implemented throughout the Company, for example, is hosted by Capgemini and our domestic employee payroll system is hosted by Ceridian. Although we have disaster recovery plans and several intrusion preventive mitigating tools and services in place, which are active inline services or are tested routinely, our portfolio of hardware and software products, solutions and services and our enterprise IT systems, including those hosted by service providers, may be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control, such as catastrophic events, power outages, natural disasters, computer system, or network failures, computer viruses or other malicious software programs, and cyber-attacks, including system hacking and other cyber-security breaches. For example, in April 2019, the Company discovered that the email accounts of two Canadian employees had been compromised resulting in the unauthorized access of customer and vendor data. These incidents were neither material nor compromised the Company\u2019s other IT systems. The failure or disruption of our IT systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and result in decreased performance, significant remediation costs, transaction errors, loss of data, processing inefficiencies, downtime, litigation, and the loss of suppliers or customers. A significant disruption or failure could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance and financial condition.\nWe cannot assure you that material weaknesses will not be identified in the future.\nWe believe that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at March 31, 2020, as reported elsewhere in this Annual Report. Although we intend to continue to aggressively monitor and improve our internal controls, we cannot assure you that other material weaknesses will not occur in the future. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in misstatements in our financial statements in amounts that could be material. Ineffective internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the value of our common stock and could also require additional restatements of our prior reported financial information.\nRegulations regarding environmental matters may affect the Company by substantially increasing the Company's costs and exposing it to potential liability.\nThe Company is subject to environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which the Company operates. Such regulations govern, among other things, emissions of pollutants into the air, wastewater discharges, waste disposal, the investigation and remediation of soil, and groundwater contamination, and the health and safety of the Company's employees. For example, the Company's products and the raw materials used in its production processes are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations. The Company may be required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of its current or proposed operations. The Company may not have been, nor may it be able to be at all times, in full compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. If the Company violates or fails to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, the Company could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators.\nAs with other companies engaged in similar activities or that own or operate real property, the Company faces inherent risks of environmental liability at its current and historical production sites. Certain environmental laws impose strict and, in certain circumstances, joint and several liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of the investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances as well as liability for related damages to natural resources. In addition, the Company may discover new facts or conditions that may change its expectations or be faced with changes in environmental laws or their enforcement that would increase its liabilities. Furthermore, its costs of complying with current and future environmental, health, and safety laws, or the Company's liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, regulated materials, may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDerivative transactions may expose us to potential losses and counterparty risk.\nWe may, from time to time, enter into certain derivative transactions, including interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts. Changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments that are not accounted for as cash flow hedges are reported as income, and accordingly could materially affect our reported income in any period. In addition, the counterparties to these derivative transactions may be financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we would be subject to risks that these counterparties default under these transactions. In some of these transactions, our exposure to counterparty credit risk may not be secured by any collateral. Global economic conditions over the last few years have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions, including bankruptcy. If one or more of the counterparties to one or more of our derivative transactions not secured by any collateral becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we would become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. We cannot assure you of the financial stability or viability of any of our counterparties.\nTo the extent that any of our indebtedness that extends beyond 2021 bears interest at rates based on LIBOR, the interest rates for these obligations might be subject to change based on recent regulatory changes.\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if at that time whether LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing USD LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. The future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate any agreements extending beyond 2021 that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established, which may have an adverse effect on our interest expense and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nShares of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Plan will be cancelled upon the effectiveness of the Plan, and pursuant to the Plan shares are be issued by New Pyxus upon the effectiveness of the Plan to certain holders of the Second Lien Notes and to the DIP Lenders, who will, pursuant to the Plan, be deemed to have signed the Shareholders Agreement. We cannot assure you that an active trading market for the New Pyxus common stock to be issued upon the effectiveness of the Plan will develop or be maintained, and the market price of the New Pyxus common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of your investment to decline.\nUpon the effectiveness of the Plan, all shares of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Plan will be cancelled pursuant to the terms of the Plan. The shares of New Pyxus common stock to be issued in connection with the effectiveness of the Plan will not initially be listed for trading on any national stock exchange. We cannot assure holders of New Pyxus common stock that an active public market for New Pyxus common stock to be issued upon the effectiveness of the Plan will develop or, if it develops, that it will be sustained. In the absence of an active public trading market, it may be difficult for holders to liquidate their investment in New Pyxus common stock. In the event New Pyxus common stock commences trading, the trading price of New Pyxus common stock may fluctuate significantly. Numerous factors, many of which we have no control over, may have a significant impact on the market prices of New Pyxus common stock. The Shareholders Agreement implemented upon the effectiveness of the Plan, which is to be deemed to have been signed by all persons receiving shares of New Pyxus common stock pursuant to the Plan, includes their agreement not to transfer such\nshares in certain transactions and to certain person as set forth in the Shareholders Agreement. A description of the Shareholders Agreement is included in \"Note 28. Subsequent Events\" to the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\".\nIn the event New Pyxus common stock commences trading, the trading price of such common stock may not accurately reflect the value of its business.\nUpon the effectiveness of the Plan, ownership of New Pyxus common stock will be highly concentrated, and there will be a limited number of shares available for trading on any public market if such a market develops. As a result, future reported trading prices for New Pyxus common stock at any given time may not accurately reflect the underlying economic value of its business at that time. Future reported trading prices could be higher or lower than the price a shareholder would be able to receive in a sale transaction, and we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient public trading in New Pyxus common stock in the future to create a liquid trading market that accurately reflects the underlying economic value of its business.\nRisks Relating to the Tobacco Industry\nReductions in demand for consumer tobacco products could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe tobacco industry, both in the United States and abroad, continues to face a number of issues that may reduce the consumption of cigarettes and adversely affect our business, sales volume, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThese issues, some of which are more fully discussed below, include:\n\u2022governmental actions seeking to ascribe to tobacco product manufacturers liability for adverse health effects associated with smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke;\n\u2022smoking and health litigation against tobacco product manufacturers;\n\u2022increased consumer acceptance of electronic cigarettes;\n\u2022tax increases on consumer tobacco products;\ncurrent and potential actions by state attorneys general to enforce the terms of the Master Settlement Agreement, or MSA, between state governments in the United States and tobacco product manufacturers;\n\u2022governmental and private bans and restrictions on smoking;\n\u2022actual and proposed price controls and restrictions on imports in certain jurisdictions outside the United States;\n\u2022restrictions on tobacco product manufacturing, marketing, advertising and sales;\n\u2022the diminishing social acceptance of smoking;\n\u2022increased pressure from anti-smoking groups;\n\u2022other tobacco product legislation that may be considered by Congress, the states, municipalities and other countries; and\n\u2022the impact of consolidation among multinational cigarette manufacturers.\nTobacco product manufacturer litigation may reduce demand for our products and services.\nOur primary customers, the leading cigarette manufacturers, have faced thousands of lawsuits brought throughout the United States and, to a lesser extent, the rest of the world. These lawsuits have been brought by different types of plaintiffs, including: (1) individuals and classes of individuals alleging personal injury and/or misleading advertising; (2) governments (including governmental and quasi-governmental entities in the United States and abroad) seeking recovery of health care costs allegedly caused by cigarette smoking; and (3) other groups seeking recovery of health care expenditures allegedly caused by cigarette smoking, including third-party health care payors, such as unions and health maintenance organizations. Damages claimed in some of the smoking and health cases have ranged into the billions of dollars. There have been many jury verdicts for plaintiffs in tobacco product litigation over the past several years. Additional plaintiffs continue to file lawsuits. The effects of the previous and current lawsuits on our customers could reduce their demand for tobacco from us.\nLegislation and regulatory and other governmental initiatives could impose burdensome restrictions on the tobacco industry and reduce consumption of consumer tobacco products and demand for our services.\nThe Tobacco Control Act, which amended the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, extends the authority of the FDA to regulate tobacco products. This act authorizes the FDA to adopt product standards for tobacco products, including the level of nicotine yield and the reduction or elimination of other constituents of the products, along with provisions for the testing of products against these standards. The act imposes further restrictions on advertising of tobacco products, authorizes the FDA to limit the sales of tobacco products to face-to-face transactions permitting the verification of the age of the purchaser, authorizes a study to determine whether the minimum age for the purchase of tobacco products should be increased and requires submission of reports from manufacturers of tobacco products to the FDA regarding product ingredients and other matters, including reports on health, toxicological, behavioral, or physiologic effects of tobacco products and their constituents. The act also mandates warning labels and requires packaging to indicate the percentage of domestically grown tobacco and foreign grown tobacco included in the product, although the FDA has issued guidance to the industry announcing its intent to enforce the latter\nrequirements until further notice. The FDA has adopted regulations under the act establishing requirements for the sale, distribution, and marketing of cigarettes, as well as package warnings and advertising limitations.\nThe act directs the FDA to promulgate regulations requiring that the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, preproduction design validation, packing, and storage of a tobacco product conform to current good manufacturing practice. Regulations under the act do not apply to tobacco leaf that is not in the possession of a manufacturer of tobacco products, or to the producers of tobacco leaf, including tobacco suppliers, tobacco warehouses, and tobacco supplier cooperatives unless those entities are controlled by a tobacco product manufacturer, but do apply to our U.S. cut rag processing facility with respect to covered tobacco products.\nIn May 2016, the FDA finalized regulations, which became effective in August 2016, that extend its regulatory authority under the act to tobacco products not previously covered by its regulations, including vaporizers, vape pens, hookah pens, electronic cigarettes (or, e-cigarettes), e-pipes, and other types of electronic nicotine delivery systems, including e-liquids used in these devices, as well as pipe tobacco and cigars (including little cigars and cigarillos), and future novel tobacco products. These regulations require manufacturers of these additional tobacco products to, among other things submit an application and obtain FDA authorization to market a new tobacco product (as noted above); register establishment(s) and submit product listing to FDA; submit listing of ingredients; submit information on harmful and potentially harmful constituents; submit tobacco health documents; not introduce into interstate commerce modified-risk tobacco products (e.g., products with label, labeling, or advertising representing that they reduce risk or are less harmful compared to other tobacco products on the market) without an FDA order; and include the required warning statement on packaging and advertisements. These regulations apply to certain of our operations that had not previously been subject to the act, including the processing of pipe tobacco and tobacco for little cigars and cigarillos at our U.S. cut rag processing facility, and to joint ventures and subsidiaries that develop, produce and sell consumable e-liquids. In addition, the May 2016 regulations make these additional tobacco products subject to certain existing restrictions on the sale of cigarettes, including then-existing restrictions prohibiting sale to individuals under 18 years of age. In addition, recent federal legislation established a national minimum purchase age of 21 for tobacco and tobacco-based products, including e-liquids.\nThe full impact of the act, including the May 2016 regulations and any future regulatory action to implement the act, is uncertain. However, if the effect of the act and FDA regulations under the act is a significant reduction in consumption of tobacco products, it could materially adversely affect our business, volume, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nReports with respect to the harmful physical effects of cigarette smoking have been publicized for many years, and the sale, promotion and use of cigarettes continue to be subject to increasing governmental regulation. Since 1964, the Surgeon General of the United States and the Secretary of Health and Human Services have released a number of reports linking cigarette smoking with a broad range of health hazards, including various types of cancer, coronary heart disease and chronic lung disease, and recommending various governmental measures to reduce the incidence of smoking. More recent reports focus upon the addictive nature of cigarettes, the effects of smoking cessation, the decrease in smoking in the United States, the economic and regulatory aspects of smoking in the Western Hemisphere, and cigarette smoking by adolescents, particularly the addictive nature of cigarette smoking in adolescence. Numerous state and municipal governments have taken and others may take actions to diminish the social acceptance of smoking of tobacco products, including banning smoking in certain public and private locations.\nA number of foreign nations also have taken steps to restrict or prohibit cigarette advertising and promotion, to increase taxes on cigarettes and to discourage cigarette smoking. In some cases, such restrictions are more onerous than those in the United States. For example, advertising and promotion of cigarettes has been banned or severely restricted for a number of years in Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Italy, Singapore and other countries. Further, in February 2005, the World Health Organization (\u201cWHO\u201d) treaty, the Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (\u201cFCTC\u201d), entered into force. This treaty, which is binding on 181 nations as of March 31, 2019, requires signatory nations to enact legislation that would require, among other things, specific actions to prevent youth smoking; restrict or prohibit tobacco product marketing; inform the public about the health consequences of smoking and the benefits of quitting; regulate the content of tobacco products; impose new package warning requirements including the use of pictorial or graphic images; eliminate cigarette smuggling and counterfeit cigarettes; restrict smoking in public places; increase and harmonize cigarette excise taxes; abolish duty-free tobacco sales; and permit and encourage litigation against tobacco product manufacturers.\nDue to the present regulatory and legislative environment, a substantial risk exists that past growth trends in tobacco product sales may not continue and that existing sales may decline. A significant decrease in worldwide tobacco consumption brought about by existing or future governmental laws and regulations would reduce demand for tobacco products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nGovernment actions can have a significant effect on the sourcing of tobacco. If some of the current efforts are successful, we could have difficulty obtaining sufficient tobacco to meet our customers\u2019 requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our performance and results of operations.\nThe WHO, through the FCTC, created a formal study group to identify and assess crop diversification initiatives and alternatives to leaf tobacco growing in countries whose economies depend upon tobacco production. The study group began its work in February 2007. In its initial report published later that year, the study group indicated that the FCTC did not aim to phase out tobacco growing, but the study group's focus on alternatives to tobacco crops was in preparation for its anticipated eventual decrease in demand resulting from the FCTC's other tobacco control initiatives.\nIf the objective of the FCTC study group were to change to seek to eliminate or significantly reduce leaf tobacco production and certain countries were to partner with the study group in pursuing this objective, we could encounter difficulty in sourcing leaf tobacco to fill customer requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues, including climate change, conservation, and natural resource management, could result in new or more stringent forms of regulatory oversight of industry activities, which may lead to increased levels of expenditures for environmental controls, land use restrictions affecting us or our suppliers, and other conditions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, certain aspects of our business generate carbon emissions. Regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions have been proposed in certain countries in which we operate. These may include limitations on such emissions, taxes or emission allowance fees on such emissions, various restrictions on industrial operations, and other measures that could affect land-use decisions, the cost of agricultural production, and the cost and means of processing and transporting our products. These actions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have been, and continue to be, subject to governmental investigations into, and litigation concerning, leaf tobacco industry buying and other payment practices.\nThe leaf tobacco industry, from time to time, has been the subject of government investigations regarding trade practices. For example, we were the subject of an investigation by the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice into certain buying practices alleged to have occurred in the industry, we were named defendants in an antitrust class action litigation alleging a conspiracy to rig bids in the tobacco auction markets, and we were the subject of an administrative investigation into certain tobacco buying and selling practices alleged to have occurred within the leaf tobacco industry in some countries within the European Union, including Spain, Italy, Greece and potentially other countries.", "PERMNO": 29867, "SIC": 5190, "TIC": "PYXSQ"}
