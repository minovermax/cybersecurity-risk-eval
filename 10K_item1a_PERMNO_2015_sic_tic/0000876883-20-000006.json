{"cik": "876883", "company": "MDC PARTNERS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-05", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below, as well as the other information contained in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The following risk factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance and should not be considered to represent a complete set of all potential risks that could affect our business, financial condition or results of operation.\nFuture economic and financial conditions could adversely impact our financial condition and results.\nAdvertising, marketing and communications expenditures are sensitive to global, national and regional macroeconomic conditions, as well as specific budgeting levels and buying patterns. Adverse developments including heightened economic uncertainty could reduce the demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\na. As a marketing services company, our revenues are highly susceptible to declines as a result of unfavorable economic conditions.\nGlobal economic conditions affect the advertising and marketing services industry more severely than other industries. In the past, some clients have responded to weakening economic conditions with reductions to their marketing budgets, which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses. This pattern may recur in the future. Decreases in our revenue would negatively affect our financial results, including a reduction of our estimates of free cash flow from operations.\nb. If our clients experience financial distress, their weakened financial position could negatively affect our own financial position and results.\nWe have a diverse client base, and at any given time, one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty, file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business. Unfavorable economic and financial conditions in the global economy could increase client financial difficulties resulting in reduced demand for our services, reduced revenues, delayed payments by clients, and increased write offs of accounts receivable.\nc. Conditions in the credit markets could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.\nTurmoil in the credit markets or a contraction in the availability of credit would make it more difficult for businesses to meet their capital requirements and could lead clients to change their financial relationship with their vendors, including us. If that were to occur, it could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.\nd. Our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2020 may be adversely affected by the recent coronavirus outbreak.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus surfaced in Wuhan, China. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others.\nMDC competes for clients in highly competitive industries.\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive environment in an industry characterized by numerous advertising and marketing agencies of varying sizes, with no single advertising and marketing agency or group of agencies having a dominant position in the marketplace. MDC is, however, smaller than several of its larger industry competitors. Competitive factors include creative reputation, management, personal relationships, quality and reliability of service and expertise in particular niche areas of the marketplace. In addition, because an agency\u2019s principal asset is its people, barriers to entry are minimal, and relatively small agencies are, on occasion, able to take all or some portion of a client\u2019s business from a larger competitor.\nWhile many of MDC\u2019s client relationships are long-standing, companies put their advertising and marketing services businesses up for competitive review from time to time, including at times when clients enter into strategic transactions or experience senior management changes. To the extent that the Company fails to maintain existing clients or attract new clients, MDC\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows may be affected in a materially adverse manner.\nIf our available liquidity is insufficient, our financial condition could be adversely affected and we may be unable to fund contingent deferred acquisition liabilities, and any put options if exercised.\nMDC maintains a committed $250 million senior secured revolving credit agreements due May 3, 2021 (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), together with cash flow from operations, to fund its working capital needs and to fund the exercise of put option\nobligations and contingent deferred acquisition payments. If credit were unavailable or insufficient under the Credit Agreement, MDC\u2019s liquidity could be adversely affected and MDC\u2019s ability to fund its working capital needs and any contingent obligations with respect to put options or contingent deferred acquisition payments could be adversely affected. MDC has made acquisitions for which it has deferred payment of a portion of the purchase price, with the deferred acquisition consideration generally payable based on achievement of certain thresholds of future earnings of the acquired company. In addition, a noncontrolling shareholder in an acquired business often has the right to require MDC to purchase all or part of its interest, either at specified dates or upon the termination of such shareholder\u2019s employment with the subsidiary or death (put rights). Payments to be made by the Company in respect of deferred acquisition consideration and noncontrolling shareholder put rights may be significantly higher than the amounts estimated by MDC because the actual obligation adjusts based on the performance of the acquired businesses over time. If available liquidity is insufficient, MDC may be unable to fund contingent deferred acquisition payments.\nMDC may not realize the benefits it expects from past acquisitions or acquisitions or other strategic transactions MDC may make in the future.\nMDC\u2019s business strategy includes ongoing efforts to engage in acquisitions of ownership interests in entities in the marketing communications services industry and other strategic transactions.\nThe success of acquisitions or strategic investments depends on the effective integration of newly acquired businesses into MDC\u2019s current operations. Such integration is subject to risks and uncertainties, including realization of anticipated synergies and cost savings, the ability to retain and attract executives and clients, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, and undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of the acquired company. MDC\u2019s failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and other strategic transactions could cause MDC to fail to realize their anticipated benefits, incur unanticipated liabilities and harm MDC\u2019s business generally. MDC\u2019s acquisitions and other strategic transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of the Company\u2019s equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and/or purchased long-lived assets, and restructuring charges, any of which could harm its financial condition or operating results. Furthermore, the anticipated benefits or value of MDC\u2019s acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not materialize.\nMDC\u2019s business could be adversely affected if it loses key clients.\nMDC\u2019s strategy has been to acquire ownership stakes in diverse marketing communications businesses to minimize the effects that might arise from the loss of any one client. The loss of one or more clients could materially affect the results of the individual agencies and MDC as a whole.\nThe loss of several of our largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nOur ten largest clients (measured by revenue generated) accounted for 23% of our revenue for the three-year period ended December 31, 2019. A significant reduction in spending on our services by our largest clients, or the loss of several of our largest clients, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nMDC\u2019s ability to generate new business from new and existing clients may be limited.\nTo increase its revenues, MDC needs to obtain additional clients or generate demand for additional services from existing clients. MDC\u2019s ability to generate initial demand for its services from new clients and additional demand from existing clients is subject to such clients\u2019 and potential clients\u2019 requirements, pre-existing vendor relationships, financial conditions, strategic plans and internal resources, as well as the quality of MDC\u2019s employees, services and reputation and the breadth of its services. To the extent MDC cannot generate new business from new and existing clients due to these limitations, MDC\u2019s ability to grow its business and to increase its revenues will be limited.\nMDC\u2019s business could be adversely affected if it loses or fails to attract key executives or employees.\nManagement succession at our operating units is very important to the ongoing results of MDC because, as in any service business, the success of a particular agency is dependent upon the leadership of key executives and management. If key executives were to leave our operating units, the relationships that MDC has with its clients could be adversely affected.\nEmployees, including creative, research, analytics, media, technology development, account and practice group specialists, and their skills and relationships with clients, are among MDC\u2019s most important assets. An important aspect of MDC\u2019s competitiveness is its ability to retain key employee and management personnel. Compensation for these key employees is an essential factor in attracting and retaining them, and MDC may not offer a level of compensation sufficient to attract and retain these key employees. If MDC fails to hire and retain a sufficient number of these key employees, it may not be able to compete effectively. If key executives were to leave our operating units, the relationships that MDC has with its clients could be adversely affected.\nMDC is exposed to the risk of client defaults.\nMDC\u2019s agencies often incur expenses on behalf of their clients for productions and in order to secure a variety of media time and space, in exchange for which they receive a fee. The difference between the gross production costs and media purchases and the revenue earned by us can be significant. While MDC takes precautions against default on payment for these services (such as credit analysis, advance billing of clients, and in some cases acting as an agent for a disclosed principal) and has historically had a very low incidence of default, MDC is still exposed to the risk of significant uncollectible receivables from our clients. The risk of a material loss could significantly increase in periods of severe economic downturn. Such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nMDC\u2019s results of operations are subject to currency fluctuation risks.\nAlthough MDC\u2019s financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a portion of its revenues and operating costs are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and other currencies, particularly the Canadian dollar, may affect MDC\u2019s financial results and competitive position.\nGoodwill, intangible assets and right-of-use assets may become impaired.\nWe have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP resulting from our acquisition activities, which principally represents the specialized know-how of the workforce at the agencies we have acquired. We test, at least annually, the carrying value of goodwill for impairment, as discussed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. The estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows. If MDC concludes that any intangible asset and goodwill values are impaired, any resulting non-cash impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on goodwill impairment recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.\nIn addition, we have recorded a significant amount of right-of-use assets in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP as a result of the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification, Leases (\u201cASC 842\u201d). Upon a triggering event, we test the right-of-use assets for impairment, as discussed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. If a right-of-use asset is impaired, the resulting non-cash impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on lease impairments recorded related to right-of-use assets.\nMDC is subject to regulations and litigation risk that could restrict our activities or negatively impact our revenues.\nAdvertising and marketing communications businesses are subject to government regulation, both domestic and foreign. There has been an increasing trend in the United States for advertisers to resort to litigation and self-regulatory bodies to challenge comparative advertising on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive. Moreover, there has recently been an expansion of specific rules, prohibitions, media restrictions, labeling disclosures, and warning requirements with respect to advertising for certain products. Proposals have been made to ban the advertising of specific products and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising which, if successful, may have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and consequently, on MDC\u2019s revenues.\nCertain of MDC\u2019s agencies produce software and e-commerce tools for their clients, and these product offerings have become increasingly subject to litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. As we expand these product offerings, the possibility of an intellectual property claim against MDC grows. Any such claim, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation and distract management from day-to-day operations. If we are not successful in defending such claims, we could be required to stop offering these services, pay monetary damages, enter into royalty or licensing arrangements, or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our clients. Such arrangements may cause our operating margins to decline.\nIn addition, laws and regulations related to consumer privacy, use of personal information and digital tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the United States and certain international markets (including the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, or \u201cGDPR,\u201d the proposed European Union \u201cePrivacy Regulation\u201d and the recently enacted California Consumer Privacy Act, or \u201cCCPA\u201d). We face increasing costs of compliance in an uncertain regulatory environment and any failure to comply with these legal requirements could result in regulatory penalties or other legal ability. Furthermore, these laws and regulations may impact the efficacy and profitability of certain digital marketing and analytics services we provide to clients, making it difficult to achieve our clients\u2019 goals. These and other related factors could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nCompliance with data privacy laws requires ongoing investment in systems, policies and personnel and will continue to impact our business in the future by increasing legal, operational and compliance costs. While we have taken steps to comply with data privacy laws, we cannot guarantee that our efforts will meet the evolving standards imposed by data protection authorities. In the event that we are found to have violated data privacy laws, we may be subject to additional potential private consumer, business\npartner or securities litigation, regulatory inquiries, governmental investigations and proceedings and we may incur damage to our reputation. Any such developments may subject us to material fines and other monetary penalties and damages, divert management\u2019s time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nSome of MDC\u2019s Partner Firms rely upon signatory service companies to employ union performers in commercials.\nSome of MDC\u2019s creative agencies that have not entered into the SAG-AFTRA Commercials Contract have traditionally used signatory service companies, which are parties to the SAG-AFTRA Commercials Contract, to employ SAG-AFTRA union performers appearing in television, new media, and other commercials produced by those agencies. SAG-AFTRA has recently persuaded the principal signatory service companies to change the way such signatory service companies do business. These changes will make it more cumbersome and expensive for advertising agencies which have not entered into the SAG-AFTRA Commercials Contract to produce advertisements using SAG-AFTRA members, and in some cases may preclude the use of SAG-AFTRA members in a production. If a Partner Firm is unable to produce a commercial using a union performer, it may reduce the amount of business conducted by such Partner Firm. Accordingly, if SAG-AFTRA\u2019s recent restrictions on signatory service companies are not modified, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems and cybersecurity incidents could adversely affect us.\nWe rely on information technologies and infrastructure to manage our business, including digital storage of client marketing and advertising information and developing new business opportunities. Increased cybersecurity threats and attacks, which are becoming more sophisticated, pose a risk to our systems and networks. Security breaches, improper use of our systems and unauthorized access to our data and information by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. We also have access to sensitive or personal data or information that is subject to privacy laws and regulations. Our systems and processes to protect against, detect, prevent, respond to and mitigate cybersecurity incidents and our organizational training for employees to develop an understanding of cybersecurity risks and threats may be unable to prevent material security breaches, theft, modification or loss of data, employee malfeasance and additional known and unknown threats. In addition, we use third-party service providers, including cloud providers, to store, transmit and process data. Any breakdown or breach in our systems or data-protection policies, or those of our third-party service providers, could adversely affect our reputation or business.\nFuture issuances of equity securities, which may include securities that would rank senior to our Class A shares, may cause dilution to our existing shareholders and adversely affect the market price of our Class A shares.\nThe market price of our Class A shares could decline as a result of sales of a large number of our Class A shares in the market, or the sale of securities convertible into a large number of our Class A shares. The perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market price of our Class A shares. On March 7, 2017, we issued 95,000 Series 4 convertible preference shares (the \u201cSeries 4 Preference Shares\u201d) with an initial aggregate liquidation preference of $95.0 million, which will be convertible into Class A shares or our Series 5 convertible preference shares at a current conversion price of $7.42 per share. On March 14, 2019, we issued 50,000 Series 6 convertible preference shares (the \u201cSeries 6 Preference Shares\u201d and, together with the Series 4 Preference Shares, the \u201cPreference Shares\u201d) with an initial aggregate liquidation preference of $50.0 million, which will be convertible into Class A shares or our Series 7 convertible preference shares at an initial conversion price of $5.00 per share. The terms of the Preference Shares provide that the conversion price may be reduced, which would result in the Preference Shares being convertible into additional Class A shares upon certain events, including distributions on our Class A shares or issuances of additional Class A shares or equity-linked securities, at a price less than the then-applicable conversion price. The issuance of Class A Shares upon conversion of the Preference Shares would result in immediate and substantial dilution to the interests of our Class A shareholders. In addition, the holders of the Preference Shares may ultimately receive and sell all of the shares issuable in connection with the conversion of such Preference Shares, which could result in a decline in the market price of our Class A shares. The market price of our Class A shares may also be affected by factors, such as whether the market price is near or above the conversion price, that could make conversion of the Preference Shares more likely.\nFurther, the Preference Shares rank senior to the Class A shares, which could affect the value of the Class A shares on liquidation or, as a result of contractual provisions, on a change in control transaction. For example, pursuant to the related purchase agreements, the Company has agreed, with certain exceptions, not to become party to certain change in control transactions that are approved by the Board other than a qualifying transaction in which holders of Preference Shares are entitled to receive cash or qualifying listed securities with a value equal to the then-applicable liquidation preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the Series 4 Preference Shares and the Series 6 Preference Shares.\nAdditionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our Class A shares, and may result in dilution to owners of our Class A shares. Because our decision to issue additional debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot\npredict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future issuances. Also, we cannot predict the effect, if any, of future issuances of our Class A shares on the market price of our Class A shares.\nThe indenture governing the 6.50% Notes and the Credit Agreement governing our secured line of credit contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business.\nMDC has issued 6.50% senior notes due 2024 in the aggregate principal amount of $900 million (the \u201c6.50% Notes\u201d). The indenture governing the 6.50% Notes and the Credit Agreement governing our lines of credit contain various provisions that limit our discretion in the operation of our business by restricting our ability to:\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\npay dividends and make other distributions;\n\u2022\nredeem or repurchase our capital stock;\n\u2022\nincur additional debt and issue capital stock;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or sell substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022\nmake loans, investments or advances;\n\u2022\nrepay subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022\nundergo a change in control;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022\nengage in new lines of business; and\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions.\nThese restrictions on our ability to operate our business in our discretion could seriously harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, mergers and acquisitions and other corporate opportunities. The Credit Agreement is subject to various additional covenants, including a senior leverage ratio, a total leverage ratio, a fixed charge coverage ratio, and a minimum EBITDA level (as defined). Events beyond our control could affect our ability to meet these financial tests, and we cannot assure you that they will be met.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations, including the 6.50% Notes.\nAs of December 31, 2019, MDC had $887.6 million, net of debt issuance costs, of indebtedness. In addition, we expect to make additional drawings under the Credit Agreement from time to time. As a holding company, our ability to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by and distributions from our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries\u2019 business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet MDC\u2019s debt service and other obligations. If we are unable to meet our expenses and debt service obligations, we may need to obtain additional debt, refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, sell assets or raise equity. We may not be able to obtain additional debt, refinance any of our indebtedness, sell assets or raise equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, to obtain additional debt or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, we currently receive senior unsecured and long-term debt and corporate quality ratings from Standard & Poor\u2019s Rating Services and Moody\u2019s Investor Service Inc. Our ratings are subject to periodic review, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our current or any future ratings. If our ratings are reduced from their current levels, this could further adversely affect our liquidity and our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and, as a result, our debt holders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable; the lenders under the Credit Agreement could terminate their commitments to loan us money and foreclose against the assets securing our borrowings; and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the 6.50% Notes;\n\u2022\nmake it difficult for us to meet our obligations with respect to our contingent deferred acquisition payments;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to increase our ownership stake in our Partner Firms;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital and other activities;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the advertising industry, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nlimit, particularly in concert with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, our ability to borrow additional funds or take other actions.\nDespite our current debt levels, we may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness, which could further increase the risks associated with our leverage.\nWe may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of our Credit Agreement and the indenture governing the 6.50% Notes permit us and our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness subject to certain limitations. If we or our subsidiaries incur additional indebtedness, the related risks that we face could increase.\nWe may be subject to adverse tax consequences such as those related to changes in tax laws or tax rates or their interpretations, and the related application of judgment in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities or other tax liabilities given the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.\nWe are a Canada-domiciled multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. While we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that jurisdictional tax authorities may take a contrary view, which may have a significant impact on our global provision for income taxes.\nTax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. The U.S. recently enacted significant tax reform, and certain provisions of the new law may adversely affect us. In addition, governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies. Many countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business. If U.S. or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nWe are a holding company dependent on our subsidiaries for our ability to service our debt.\nMDC is a holding company with no operations of our own. Consequently, our ability to service our debt is dependent upon the earnings from the businesses conducted by our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities. Although our operating subsidiaries have generally agreed to allow us to consolidate and \u201csweep\u201d cash, subject to the timing of payments due to noncontrolling interest holders, any distribution of earnings to us from our subsidiaries is contingent upon the subsidiaries\u2019 earnings and various other business considerations. Also, our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization, and therefore the right of the holders of common stock to participate in those assets, will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary\u2019s creditors. In addition, even if we were a creditor of any of our subsidiaries, our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us.\nMDC may not be able to meet our performance targets and milestones.\nMDC communicates to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance. These targets and milestones are not predictions or guidance, and investors should not place undue reliance on them. MDC may fail to meet such targets and milestones because of the inherent risk and uncertainty of operating our business and executing on our strategic and other plans.\nMDC is launching alliances among its agencies to improve collaboration and client service.\nMDC is in the midst of transforming how its advertising and marketing agencies collaborate and work together in order to improve MDC\u2019s ability to attract and retain clients, and expand the amount and variety of services provided to clients. There can be no guarantee that the structures and incentives we have put in place to improve collaboration among our agencies will be successful, or will lead to attracting or retaining clients, or expanding the amount and variety of services provided to clients. If our agency collaboration initiatives are unsuccessful, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nMDC is consolidating and densifying its real estate occupancy in New York.\nMDC is in the midst of consolidating the real estate occupancy of its advertising and marketing agencies, in order to lower MDC\u2019s leasing costs and improve collaboration among our agencies. MDC contemplates that in New York City its advertising and marketing agencies will colocate in a single location. MDC may not be able to sublease existing spaces to be vacated on expected terms or at all. Our anticipated savings from consolidating and densifying our real estate occupancy is subject to timely completing construction, and construction could be delayed. If we fail to sublet on expected terms the existing leased offices to be vacated, or construction of our consolidated leased space is delayed, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur shares of common stock are thinly traded and our stock price may be volatile.\nBecause MDC\u2019s Class A shares are thinly traded, their market price may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market in general or the stock prices of similar companies, which are exchanged, listed or quoted on NASDAQ or another stock exchange. Our Class A shares may be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership, and as a result, the trading price for our Class A shares may be more volatile. Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of our Class A shares may have a greater impact on the trading price for our stock than would be the case if our public float were larger.\nThe Company has identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting for income taxes. If we are unable to remediate the material weakness and otherwise maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, it could result in us not preventing or detecting on a timely basis a material misstatement of the Company's financial statements.\nManagement identified a material weakness in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting for income taxes as of December 31, 2019, as described in Part II, Item 9A of this Form 10-K.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAlthough we intend to implement a plan to remediate this material weakness, we cannot be certain of the success of the plan. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness, or if one or more additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, we may not be able to prevent or identify irregularities or ensure the fair and accurate presentation of our financial statements included in our periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.", "PERMNO": 81527, "SIC": 7311, "TIC": "MDCA"}
