{"cik": "1090061", "company": "OMNOVA SOLUTIONS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-01-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nThis Annual Report includes descriptions of our current business, operations, and financial condition, as well as \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d as defined by federal securities laws. All forward-looking statements by the Company, including verbal statements, are intended to qualify for the protections afforded forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements reflect Management\u2019s current expectation, judgment, belief, assumption, estimate or forecast about future events, circumstances or results and may address business conditions and prospects, strategy, capital structure, debt and cash levels, sales, profits, earnings, markets, products, technology, operations, customers, raw materials, claims and litigation, financial condition, and accounting policies among other matters. Words such as, but not limited to, \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201cforecasts,\u201d \u201cseeks,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201ctargets,\u201d \u201coptimistic,\u201d \u201clikely,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \"committed,\" and similar expressions or phrases identify forward-looking statements.\nAll descriptions of our current business, operations and financial condition, as well as all forward-looking statements, involve risks and uncertainties. Many risks and uncertainties are inherent in business generally. Other risks and uncertainties are more specific to the Company\u2019s businesses and strategy, or to any new businesses which the Company may enter into or acquire. There also may be risks and uncertainties not currently known to us. The occurrence of any of such risks and uncertainties and the impact of such occurrences is often not predictable or within the Company\u2019s control. Such impacts could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, operations, or financial condition, as well as the Company's actual and projected results and the value of an investment in the Company. In some cases, such effect could be material. Certain risks and uncertainties facing the Company are described below or elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nAll written and verbal descriptions of our business, operations and financial condition and all forward-looking statements attributable to the Company or any person acting on the Company\u2019s behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the risks, uncertainties, and cautionary statements contained and referenced herein. All such descriptions and any forward-looking statement speak only as of the date on which such description or statement is made, and the Company undertakes no obligation, and specifically declines any obligation, other than that imposed by law, to publicly update or revise any such description or forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nRisks associated with the proposed merger of the Company with Synthomer\nWe may face business and operational impacts due to the announcement of our proposed merger with Synthomer and the pendency of the proposed merger.\nOn July 3, 2019, the Company announced it had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) with Synthomer, Spirit USA Holdings Inc., and Synthomer USA LLC, pursuant to which Spirit USA Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Synthomer, would merge with and into the Company, subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals and other customary conditions (the \"Merger\"). Uncertainty about the effect of the Merger on our employees, customers, suppliers, distributors and other parties may have a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that our employees, including key personnel, can be retained to the same extent that\nwe have previously been able to attract and retain employees. In addition, we have diverted, and will continue to divert, significant management resources towards the completion of the Merger, which may limit the amount of time that can be focused on our business and operations by such persons. Parties with which we do business, including our suppliers and distributors, may experience uncertainty associated with the Merger, including with respect to current or future business relationships with us, with Synthomer, or with the combined enterprise if the Merger is consummated. In addition, costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the Merger Agreement, the Merger, or pending and future litigation and other legal proceedings, including any such proceedings related to the Merger and instituted against us and others, cannot be quantified. The Company is required to operate under certain restrictions on its business pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, including, among other things, restrictions on the ability in certain cases to enter into contracts or to enter into contracts having certain terms, to acquire or dispose of assets, or to incur indebtedness or incur capital expenditures, until the Merger becomes effective or the Merger Agreement terminates. These restrictions may prevent us from taking actions with respect to our business that we may consider advantageous and result in our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and industry developments. Finally, the Company may experience a loss of business based on the expectation that Synthomer will own the Company following the closing of the Merger.\nThe proposed merger of the Company with Synthomer may not be completed on a timely basis, or at all, and the failure to complete or delays in completing the proposed merger could adversely affect our business, financial results and stock price.\nCompletion of the Merger with Synthomer is subject to several conditions outside of our or Synthomer\u2019s control that may prevent or delay its completion, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. If the Merger is not completed, the Company\u2019s share price could decrease if and to the extent that the current market price for the Company\u2019s common shares reflects an assumption that a transaction will be consummated. Additionally, the Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights and provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, the Company will pay Synthomer a cash termination fee of $15.8 million. Further, a failed transaction may result in negative publicity and a negative impression of the Company in the capital markets and among the investment community. Finally, any disruption to our business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the Merger, including any adverse impact in our relationships with employees, distributors or suppliers could continue or accelerate in the event of a failed transaction.\nIf the proposed merger of the Company with Synthomer is completed, OMNOVA\u2019s common shares are expected to be delisted and deregistered.\nFollowing the successful completion of the Merger, our common shares, which are currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d), will be converted into the right to receive $10.15 per share in cash and are expected to be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. If OMNOVA's common shares are delisted and deregistered, there will no longer be a public trading market for our common shares.\nMarket and Economic Risks\nOur business is sensitive to general economic, business, and industry conditions.\nWe are exposed to general economic, business and industry conditions, both in the United States and internationally. Adverse global economic and financial conditions are difficult to predict and mitigate against, and therefore the potential impact is difficult to estimate. The end markets that we serve can be sensitive to changes in general economic conditions and can be volatile, with significant, rapid, and unpredictable reductions in demand and/or increases in raw material and other costs. Adverse general economic conditions may cause, among other things, significant reductions in available capital and liquidity from banks and other credit providers, substantial volatility in equity and currency values worldwide, and/or a prolonged recessionary or slow growth period. In addition, downturns in our customers\u2019 particular industries, and markets, even when overall economic conditions are favorable, may also adversely affect our sales, profitability, operating results, and cash flows.\nOur suppliers may be similarly affected by general economic conditions which may affect their access to capital and liquidity, and which may in turn cause them to raise prices or reduce or eliminate production.\nRaw material prices and availability have a significant impact on results.\nThe cost of raw materials has a significant impact on results. The principal raw materials that we use in our business are derived from petrochemicals and chemical feedstocks. The prices of many of these raw materials are cyclical and volatile and are affected by supply and demand factors beyond our control. While we generally attempt to pass along higher raw material costs to our customers in the form of price increases, there historically has been a delay between an increase in our raw material costs and our ability to increase the prices of our products. Additionally, we may not be able to increase the prices of our products due to competitive pricing pressure and other factors.\nWe generally have multiple global raw material suppliers. However, in some cases there are a limited number of suppliers which are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards. Certain raw materials are only available from a single source. While we use a limited number of raw materials which are available only from a single source and we order those materials in limited quantities, the loss of any of these raw materials could significantly impact our ability to deliver differentiated products in some of our most specialized businesses. Accordingly, sole source and limited source suppliers generally have greater pricing and supply leverage.\nIn some cases, we may choose to sole source certain raw materials to obtain certain commercial advantages, including superior pricing and terms. Any disruption in raw material availability from one of these suppliers may require us to secure raw material supplies from alternative suppliers on less favorable terms.\nVarious factors, including feedstock shortages, production disruptions, natural disasters, the financial stability of our suppliers, supplier commitments to others, and internal raw material use by suppliers have reduced and eliminated, and in the future may reduce or eliminate, the availability of certain raw materials. Additionally, disruptions in transportation could delay receipt of raw materials. As a result of any of the foregoing events, higher prices and shortages could occur in the future, which may result in customers switching to substitutes for our products.\nThe occurrence or threat of extraordinary events, including natural disasters, political disruptions, terrorist attacks, public health issues, and acts of war, could significantly disrupt production, and decrease market demand for our products.\nExtraordinary events, including natural disasters, political disruptions, terrorist attacks, public health issues, and acts of war could adversely affect the economy generally, and disrupt our business and operations resulting in a loss of sales and customers. In addition, in many cases we do not have redundant manufacturing or transportation capability and thus, any disruption of production or transportation may result in loss of sales and customers. Such events may also disrupt our supply chain and access to necessary raw materials.\nWe are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries and markets.\nWe conduct a significant portion of our business in countries outside of the United States. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social, regulatory, and economic requirements and conditions. Risks associated with international operations, include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022region to region fluctuations in key raw material costs;\n\u2022transportation delays and interruptions;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability and disruptions, including instability and disruptions caused by actual or threatened trade and tariff disputes with the United States, China, Brexit, or other Brexit-like events;\n\u2022failure to have or obtain, delays in obtaining, or the revocation of governmental licenses and permits;\n\u2022the imposition of duties and tariffs;\n\u2022import and export controls;\n\u2022government control of capital transactions, including the borrowing of funds for operations or the expatriation of cash;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing operations;\n\u2022limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies;\n\u2022more stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations;\n\u2022potentially adverse tax consequences; and\n\u2022government expropriation of a business or assets.\nWe participate in highly competitive markets.\nMany of the markets in which we operate are highly competitive. The bases of competition may include product performance and quality, price, product availability, security of supply, and customer service. Some of our competitors are larger and have more financial resources than us. We may also experience increased competition from companies that offer alternative products based on technologies and processes that have superior performance or better pricing, which could cause a decline in the market acceptance of our products. The increasing pressure from our competitors to keep pace and develop new technologies and products requires us to incur substantial expense.\nOngoing consolidation in various industries continues to create individual customers with greater purchasing power and competitors with greater financial and other resources. Customers in established markets like the United States and Europe face their own competitive pressures, particularly from businesses in regions with lower overhead costs. These competitive pressures may require us to reduce prices and attempt to offset such price reductions with improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures, which options may be limited or unavailable. Additionally, larger competitors may be better positioned to weather prolonged periods of reduced prices, which may incentivize them to reduce prices even when not dictated by market and competitive conditions.\nLegal, Regulatory, and Compliance Risks\nWe are subject to extensive and increasing governmental regulation.\nOur business is subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local regulations which govern and restrict numerous aspects of our business and involve significant compliance cost. These regulations may change rapidly, and new regulations or interpretations of regulations may be applied to us, due to circumstances beyond our control. We expect regulations, and the costs associated with compliance, to continue to increase.\nAmong these regulations are increasingly stringent environmental and health and safety regulations. The cost of compliance with these regulations is significant and increasing, and violating these regulations can result in substantial costs, including fines, damages, criminal or civil sanctions, remediation costs, and interruptions in our operations. These regulations may also restrict or prohibit our ability to use certain raw materials key to our products or prohibit the sale of our products altogether.\nCertain environmental requirements provide for strict, and under certain circumstances joint and several, liability for investigation and remediation of releases of regulated materials or from properties owned or operated by us or our predecessors and from properties where substances were sent for off-site treatment or disposal.\nWe may be unable to effectively protect our intellectual property or may be subject to intellectual property claims.\nFor certain products we rely on trademark, trade secret, patent, and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property. We cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be successfully asserted in the future or that they will not be invalidated or circumvented. In addition, the\nlaws of some foreign countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The failure or inability of us to protect our proprietary information could make us less competitive.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to claims or allegations that we infringe upon or have misappropriated the intellectual property of third parties. Defending against such claims is costly and intellectual property litigation often involves complex questions of fact and law, with unpredictable results. We may be forced to acquire rights to such third-party intellectual property on unfavorable terms (if rights are made available at all), pay damages, modify accused products to be non-infringing, or stop selling the applicable product altogether.\nWe are subject to claims and litigation.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to various claims, proceedings, and lawsuits related to products, services, contracts, employment, environmental, safety, intellectual property, and other matters arising out of our business operations or the business operations of our predecessors. Whether founded or unfounded, if any such claims, proceedings, or lawsuits are not resolved in our favor, they may result in significant financial liability, negatively impact our business operations, and harm the reputation of the Company. The costs of investigating and defending against claims can be substantial. We may not have applicable insurance coverage, and any such insurance coverage that we do have may be inadequate to cover the full cost of a particular claim.\nResolutions of claims, proceedings, and lawsuits can be unpredictable and can often take years. As a result, any estimates of liability that we may have made could be materially over or understated.\nChanges in accounting policies, standards, and interpretations could materially affect how we report our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe Financial Accounting Standard Board (\"FASB\"), regulatory agencies, and other bodies that establish accounting standards periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Additionally, those bodies that establish and interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB and the SEC) may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how the Company records and reports its financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In unusual circumstances, the Company could be required to retroactively apply a new or revised standard, resulting in changes to previously reported financial results.\nBusiness and Strategic Risks\nOur manufacturing facilities are subject to operating risks.\nWe are dependent on the continued operation of our manufacturing facilities. These facilities are subject to hazards associated with the manufacturing, handling, storage, and transportation of chemical materials and products, including tank and pipeline leaks and ruptures, explosions, fires, inclement weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, labor difficulties, transportation interruptions, and environmental risks. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to, or destruction of, property and equipment, and environmental contamination. The occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities may diminish or eliminate our ability to manufacture product. Further, from time to time, we may experience capacity limitations in our manufacturing operations. If we are unable to effectively forecast our customers\u2019 demand, it could affect our ability to successfully manage such operating capacity limitations.\nWe may be unable to achieve, or may be delayed in achieving, the objectives and benefits of our cost reduction initiatives.\nWe continuously utilize operational excellence program improvements such as our One OMNOVA initiative, LEAN SixSigma, manufacturing footprint optimization, global supply chain management, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and other initiatives in an effort to improve efficiencies and lower our cost structure. There may be unanticipated difficulties in implementing one or more of these initiatives, and we may not ultimately realize the full benefits of, or be able to sustain the benefits anticipated by, these initiatives. Additionally, even if we achieve these goals, the cost of implementing these initiatives could ultimately exceed their benefits. In addition, certain of these initiatives have resulted in us streamlining and consolidating our manufacturing capacity, increasing the risk of business interruption if a consolidated manufacturing site experiences operational or other difficulties.\nOur sales and profitability depend on our ability to develop and commercialize innovative new products that can be value priced.\nOur specialization strategy requires that we develop, introduce, sell, and support innovative new products and technologies on a timely basis and that we make significant investments in research and development to do so. We may be unsuccessful in developing or introducing new products, modifying our existing products, achieving market acceptance of new products, or securing pricing that reflects the investment into and value of our new products.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate acquisitions into our operations.\nThe integration of acquisitions into our operations involves a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating operations and personnel at different locations;\n\u2022\ndiversion of Management attention;\n\u2022\npotential disruption or loss of business due to negative reactions to the acquisition by customers, suppliers, and other key constituencies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assimilating the technologies and products of the acquisition;\n\u2022\ninability to retain key personnel;\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating operational and financial information technology systems;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in expanding product manufacturing to new sites; and\n\u2022\ninability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures, and policies.\nThese risks may be magnified in acquisitions of significant size and scale. If we are unable to effectively integrate operations and personnel in a timely and efficient manner after an acquisition is completed, we may not realize the projected benefits of the acquisition.\nOur information systems may experience an interruption or a breach in security.\nWe rely heavily on electronic communications, information technology systems (both internal systems and external systems provided by third parties) and the internet to operate our factories, sell our products, fulfill orders, manage inventory, and bill, collect, and make payments. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized intrusion, and other events, any of which could interrupt our business operations. Our business may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism.\nCybersecurity attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including persons who are linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our systems, our data, or the data of our customers.\nOur security systems may not be able to protect our systems from attacks or other disruptions due to the rapid evolution and sophistication of cyberattack methods. Any significant disruption or slowdown of our current or future information systems as a result of a system security failure could disrupt the flow of operational information, cause orders to be lost or delayed, cause disruption and damage to our manufacturing facilities, damage our reputation with our customers, or cause our customers to cancel orders. Additionally, the theft of sensitive data and our inability to protect our trade secrets or information concerning our employees, customers, or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business, customers, suppliers, and employees. These risks may increase in the future as we increase our usage of mobile platforms and expand our internal usage of third-party, web-based products and applications.\nWe generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers.\nWith some exceptions, most of our business is conducted on a purchase order basis rather than through long-term contracts. Accordingly, customers may elect to discontinue business with us with limited or no notice and with limited recourse by OMNOVA.\nCertain product lines contribute disproportionately to the Company\u2019s profitability.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s product lines and certain of its customers contribute disproportionately to the Company\u2019s operating profit. A downturn in the markets those product lines serve, or the loss of these customers, could have an adverse affect on our financial results.\nWe are exposed to credit risk from our customers.\nWe extend credit on most of our sales, which exposes us to the risk of customer nonpayment. In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers, including financial statements, credit reports, and other information. We may also rely on representations of these customers or third-parties as to the accuracy and completeness of credit risk related information. The inaccuracy of that information or those representations would affect our ability to accurately evaluate the credit risk of a customer. Even with accurate information, negative changes in economic, business, or industry conditions may increase the credit risk of customers who are initially determined to have acceptable credit risk.\nEmployee healthcare costs continue to increase.\nWe maintain a self-insured healthcare plan under which we generally share the cost of health care with certain of our employees and retirees. Employee healthcare is a significant operating cost for us, and these costs have continued to escalate well in excess of other inflationary trends over the past several years. If healthcare costs continue to increase, we may not be able or willing to pass these costs along to our employees and retirees.\nWe may be unable to attract or retain key employees.\nMany parts of our business are highly technical and specialized. Global competition for skilled employees meeting our specialized needs is intense and our business success is dependent on our ability to attract highly-qualified new employees or retain our key employees. Our inability to attract necessary talent or the unanticipated departure of any key member of Management or any key employee, could adversely affect our ability to implement strategic initiatives and effectively operate our business.\nWe are subject to collective bargaining agreements with certain employees.\nApproximately 12% of our employees located in the United States are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In addition, certain employees of our foreign operations are also covered by collective bargaining agreements. We may not be able to renew our collective bargaining agreements on terms similar to current terms, or renegotiate collective bargaining agreements on terms acceptable to us. The prolonged failure to renew or renegotiate a collective bargaining agreement could result in work stoppages. Additionally, in foreign jurisdictions where we operate, national unions and foreign governments may be unable to reach agreements, which could result in work stoppages that are out of the Company\u2019s control. In addition, if a collective bargaining agreement is negotiated at higher-than-anticipated cost, absorbing those costs or passing them through to customers in the form of higher prices may make us less competitive.\nOur U.S. pension plan is underfunded, requiring the Company to make significant cash contributions to the plan.\nThe Company\u2019s U.S. pension plan is underfunded, and we are required to make significant cash contributions to it to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by benefit and tax laws. Contribution amounts are based on plan performance, interest rates, and pension funding legislation, among other factors. We currently expect to make a contribution of $6.6 million to our U.S. pension plan during 2020, in part to satisfy\nour requirements under the Pension Protection Act of 2006. We cannot predict whether changing conditions including interest rates, pension assets performance, discount rates, government regulation, or other factors will require us to make future contributions in excess of current expectations, or whether we will have the funds necessary to make minimum pension contributions at the times that they may be required.\nWe maintain cash balances in foreign financial institutions.\nWe maintain cash balances in foreign financial institutions. While we monitor the financial institutions that we maintain accounts with, we may not be able to recover our funds in the event that the financial institution would fail. In addition, we may be limited by foreign governments in the amount and timing of funds to be repatriated from foreign financial institutions.\nWe carry a significant amount of goodwill on our balance sheet.\nAs of November 30, 2019, we had goodwill of $69.4 million. The future occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment, such as a significant adverse change in business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a material negative change in relationships with significant customers, strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions, loss of key personnel, or a more-likely-than-not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of, could result in goodwill impairment charges. We have recorded goodwill impairment charges in the past, and such charges materially affected our historical results of operations. For additional information, see Note A, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nThe market price for our common shares is particularly volatile.\nPrior to the announcement of the Merger Agreement, the market for our common shares was characterized by significant price volatility, and if the merger is not completed we expect that our share price will continue to be volatile. The trading of relatively small quantities of our common shares may cause disproportionate movements upwards and downwards in our share price due to our small market capitalization and low trading volume, and the cyclical nature of our business may create prolonged periods of higher or lower share prices not correlated to Company performance or to general economic or market conditions.\nDebt Risks\nOur substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.\nWe have substantial debt and, as a result, significant debt service obligations. Our substantial debt could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt agreements;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including interest rate fluctuations, because a portion of our borrowings, including those under our term loan and our revolving credit facility, are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, pension contributions and investments, and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets we serve;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing due to applicable financial and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements, and;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts and any acquisitions we may make in the future depends on our ability to generate cash in the future and our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We could be required to obtain the consent of the lenders under our term loan and our revolving credit facility to refinance material portions of our debt. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our debt.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our debt. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. If our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. Additionally, the agreements governing our debt agreements will limit the use of the proceeds from any disposition; as a result, we may not be allowed, under these documents, to use proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy all current debt service obligations. Further, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity, and we cannot assure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nDespite ongoing actions to reduce our debt, we may still be required to incur significant additional debt.\nWe may be able to incur substantial additional debt, including additional secured debt, in the future, and such additional debt may be necessary to accomplish some of our strategic objectives. Our debt agreements restrict but do not completely prohibit us from incurring substantial additional debt. If new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify.\nOur debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities.\nOur debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt or issue certain disqualified stock and preferred stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends or certain other distributions on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments or other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nplace restrictions on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets or merge with or into other companies;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nguarantee debt;\n\u2022\ncreate liens; and\n\u2022\nenter into unrelated businesses.\nOur debt agreements require us to meet certain financial covenants, including covenants relating to senior net debt leverage, minimum excess availability and a springing minimum fixed charge coverage ratio if average excess availability falls below a certain level.\nAs a result of these covenants and restrictions, we may be limited in how we conduct our business and may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any future debt we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We may not be able maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, we may be unable to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.\nMoreover, our revolving credit facility provides the lenders considerable discretion to impose reserves, which could materially impair the amount of borrowings that would otherwise be available to us. There can be no assurance that the lenders under our revolving credit facility will not impose such actions during the term of our revolving credit facility and further, were they to do so, the resulting impact of this action could materially and adversely impair our ability to make interest payments on our debt.\nIf we default under our debt agreements, we may not be able to service our debt obligations.\nIn the event of a default under our debt agreements, the lenders under each of these facilities could elect to declare all amounts borrowed, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be due and payable. If such acceleration occurs, we may not be able to repay the amounts due under our debt agreements. This could have serious consequences to our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent.\nOur subsidiaries may incur obligations that will constrain their ability to provide us with cash, which may affect our ability to make payments on our debt.\nOur cash flows and our ability to service our debt, including our ability to make interest and principal payments when due, are dependent upon cash dividends and other distributions or other transfers from our subsidiaries. Dividends, loans, and advances to us from our subsidiaries may be restricted by covenants in certain debt agreements. If our subsidiaries incur obligations with these restrictive covenants, it will constrain our subsidiaries' ability to provide us with cash, which may affect our ability to make payments on our debt.\nThe LIBOR calculation method may change and LIBOR is expected to be phased out after 2021.\nThe Company\u2019s debt agreements permit interest on the outstanding principal balance to be calculated based on LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the \"FCA\") announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In the meantime, actions by the FCA, other regulators, or law enforcement agencies may result in changes to the method by which LIBOR is calculated. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes or any other reforms to LIBOR that may be enacted in the U.K. or elsewhere.", "PERMNO": 87214, "SIC": 2821, "TIC": "OMN"}
