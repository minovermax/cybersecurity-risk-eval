{"cik": "826253", "company": "AURA SYSTEMS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-07-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nWe have been a party to litigation, a consent solicitation and a proxy contest with shareholders controlling a majority of the Company\u2019s stock, which is costly and time-consuming and has had a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and could adversely affect our stock price.\nOn March 26, 2019, various stockholders of the Company controlling a combined total of more than 27.5 million shares delivered a signed written consent to the Company removing Ronald Buschur as a member of the Company\u2019s Board and electing Cipora Lavut as a director of the Company. On March 27, 2019, those same stockholders delivered a further signed written consent to the Company removing William Anderson and Si Ryong Yu as members of the Company\u2019s Board and electing Robert Lempert and David Mann as directors of the Company. These written consents represented a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock as of March 26, 2019 and March 27, 2019, respectively. Because of Aura\u2019s refusal to recognize the legal effectiveness of the consents, on April 8, 2019 the stockholders filed suit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware pursuant to Section 225 of the Delaware General Corporations Law, seeking an order confirming the validity of the consents and declaring that Aura\u2019s Board consists of Ms. Lavut, Mr. Mann, Dr. Lempert, Mr. Douglas and Mr. Diaz-Vers\u00f3n, Jr. On July 8, 2019 the Court of Chancery entered final judgment in favor of the stockholder plaintiffs, confirming that (a) Ronald Buschur, Si Ryong Yu and William Anderson had been validly removed by the holders of a majority of the Company\u2019s outstanding stock acting by written consent (b) Ms. Lavut, Mr. Mann and Dr. Lempert had been validly elected by the holders of a majority of the Company\u2019s outstanding stock acting by written consent, and (c) the Company\u2019s Board of Directors validly consists of Cipora Lavut, David Mann, Robert Lempert, Gary Douglas and Salvador Diaz-Vers\u00f3n, Jr. Aura\u2019s refusal to recognize the legal effectiveness of the consents and the decision by the Company\u2019s former leadership team to utilize corporate resources to vigorously contest the shareholder action has consumed the Company\u2019s financial resources, temporarily stagnated operations, and resulted in substantial costs, all of which had a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe have a history of losses, and we may not be profitable in any future period.\nExcept for fiscal 2018, in each fiscal year since our reorganization in 2006, we have reported losses. For fiscal years 2019 and 2020, we recorded net losses of $2.5 million and $2.6 million, respectively. Since the Company\u2019s Chapter 11 Plan reorganization in 2006, we have spent considerable amounts on, among other things, building market awareness and infrastructure for sales and distribution, enhancing our engineering capabilities, perfecting an all-electric refrigeration transport system for midsize trucks, developing a 20 kW product, and developing a nine-inch system capable of delivering approximately 4 kW of power. We continue to need substantial funds for the development of new products, enhancement of existing products and in order to expand sales. However, sales of our products have not increased as we expected them to and may never increase to the level that we need to expand our operations, or even to sustain them. We can provide no assurance as to when, or if, we will be profitable in the future. Even if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain it.\nThe effects of a pandemic or widespread outbreak of an illness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, has had and could continue to have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe recent outbreak of COVID-19, which has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a pandemic, has spread across the globe and is impacting worldwide economic activity. A pandemic, including COVID-19, or other public widespread outbreak of an illness, poses the risk that we, our employees, our suppliers, our customers and others may be restricted or prevented from conducting business activities for indefinite or intermittent periods of time, including as a result of employee health and safety concerns, shutdowns, shelter in place orders, travel restrictions and other actions and restrictions that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. While we have implemented measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect our fiscal 2021 results of operations to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent of the impact on our business will depend on a number of evolving factors, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, as well as the possibility of the pandemic re-occurring, actions taken by governmental authorities to restrict certain business operations and social activity and impose travel restrictions, the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and whether recessionary conditions will persist, consumer demand, the ability of our supply chain to deliver in a timely and cost-effective manner, the ability of our employees and manufacturing facilities to operate efficiently and effectively, the continued viability and financial stability of our customers and suppliers and future access to capital, all of which remain uncertain. As a result, the magnitude and duration of the impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition cannot be determined at this time.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers in industries susceptible to trends and factors affecting those industries, including the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur AuraGen\u00ae system is geared toward end-markets such as commercial vehicles, communications, transportation industries, and consumer and industrial equipment markets. Factors negatively affecting these industries also negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any adverse occurrence, including industry slowdown, recession, costly or constraining regulations, excessive inflation, prolonged disruptions in one or more of our customers\u2019 production schedules or labor disturbances, that results in significant decline in the volume of sales in these industries, or in an overall downturn in the business and operations of our customers in these industries, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, global vehicle production has decreased, and some manufacturers have completely shut down manufacturing operations in some countries and regions, including the United States and Europe. As a result, we have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales. If the global economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic continue or increase, overall customer demand may continue to decrease which could have a further adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe will need additional capital in the future to meet our obligations and financing may not be available. During fiscal 2020, the Company attempted to increase its engineering and manufacturing activities, but it still struggled with meeting its financial requirements. If we cannot obtain additional capital, we will not be able to continue our operations.\nAs a result of our operating losses, we have largely financed our operations through sales of our debt and equity securities. Since fiscal 2017, the Company has significantly reduced its engineering, manufacturing, sales, and marketing activities to focus on renegotiating numerous financial obligations and conserving cash. For fiscal 2019, we had approximately $2.5 million negative cash flows from operations, and commencing with fiscal 2020, the Company\u2019s engineering and manufacturing activities remained limited due to our inability to raise significant amounts of new financing. Following July 2019, under the new management team, we increased our sales, engineering, manufacturing, and marketing activities to improve operating results, but we continued to operate with a negative cash flow from operations for fiscal 2020 of approximately $0.8 million, or an improvement of approximately $1.7 million. Our ability to continue as a going concern is directly dependent upon our ability to obtain additional operating capital and generating sufficient operating cash flow. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused significant uncertainty and volatility in the credit markets and there can be no assurance that lenders or investors will make additional commitments to provide financing to us under current circumstances. As a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be required to raise additional capital and our access to and cost of financing will depend on, among other things, global economic conditions, conditions in the global financing markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing, and our prospects. If we are unable to obtain additional funding as and when we need it, we will not be able to recommence operations or undertake our planned expansion.\nOur independent public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph in its opinion to the effect that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur independent public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph in its opinion to the effect that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We do not have any sufficient committed sources of capital and do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed on terms that are acceptable, if at all. This going concern statement from our independent public accounting firm may discourage some investors from purchasing our stock or providing alternative capital financing. The failure to satisfy our capital requirements will adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf we do not receive additional financing when and as needed, we may not be able to continue the research, development and commercialization of our technology and products. In that case, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur capital requirements have been and will continue to be significant. We will require substantial additional funds in excess of our current financial resources for research, development and commercialization of products, to obtain and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights in these technologies and products, and for working capital and other purposes, the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain. When and as we need additional funds, such funds may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot obtain additional funding when and as needed, our business and results of operation would be materially and adversely affected.\nMarket acceptance of our AuraGen\u00ae product line is uncertain. If a large enough market does not develop for our products, our business and the results of our operations will be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business is dependent upon sales generated from our AuraGen\u00ae/VIPER family of products. This product line utilizes advanced technology and has only recently begun being used in the marketplace for selected applications. We are dependent on the broad acceptance by businesses and industry of our products. Because the market for our product line is emerging, the potential size of this market and the timing of its development cannot be predicted. A significant market may fail to develop, or it may develop more slowly than we anticipate, either of which will have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability or failure to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services and brand, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur patents, trademarks, and all of our other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. There are events that are outside of our control that pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Due to our lack of financial resources, we may not be able to adequately protect our technology portfolio or apply for new patents to extend our intellectual property portfolio. The expiration of patents in our patent portfolio may also have an adverse effect on our business. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and or our ability to compete. Protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming and we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our patent rights or to determine the scope and validity of third-party intellectual property rights and we may not have the financial resources to pay for such litigation. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources.\nWe seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations. It is possible, however, that some of these innovations may not be protectable. In addition, given the costs of obtaining patent protection, we may choose not to protect certain innovations that later turn out to be important. Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable. Our inability or failure to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business by reducing the value of our products, services and brand.\nWe occasionally become subject to commercial disputes that could harm our business by distracting our management from the operation of our business, by increasing our expenses and, if we do not prevail, by subjecting us to potential monetary damages and other remedies.\nFrom time to time we are engaged in disputes regarding our commercial transactions. These disputes could result in monetary damages or other remedies that could adversely impact our financial position or operations. Even if we prevail in these disputes, they may distract our management from operating our business and the cost of defending these disputes would reduce our operating results.\nWe have been named as a party in various legal proceedings, and we may be named in additional litigation, all of which will require significant management time and attention, result in significant legal expenses and may result in an unfavorable outcome, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are and may become subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in or outside the ordinary course of business. Certain current lawsuits and pending proceedings are described under Part I, Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d\nThe results of these lawsuits and future legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Also, our insurance coverage may be insufficient or not provide any coverage at all for certain claims, our assets may be insufficient to cover any amounts that exceed our insurance coverage, and we may have to pay damage awards or otherwise may enter into settlement arrangements in connection with such claims. Any such payments or settlement arrangements in current or future litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. Even if the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are not successful, current future litigation could result in substantial costs and significantly and adversely impact our reputation and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. In addition, such lawsuits may make it more difficult to finance our operations.\nWe are currently party to litigation with a former director relating to approximately $10.6 million and approximately 3.33 million warrants which the director claims are owed to him and his affiliates. An adverse ruling on these claims in this litigation would materially and adversely affect our business results or operating and financial condition, dilute our shareholders\u2019 equity interests in the Company and could adversely affect our stock price.\nThe Company is presently engaged in a dispute with a former director, Robert Kopple, relating to approximately $10.6 million (representing approximately $5.4 million loaned to the Company over the course of 2013 to 2016; approximately $170,000 Mr. Kopple claims to have advanced or paid to third parties on Aura\u2019s behalf; and approximately $5 million Mr. Kopple claims to be owed for interest, loan fees and late payment fees) and approximately 3.33 million warrants which Mr. Kopple claims to be owed to him and his affiliates by the Company. In July 2017, Mr. Kopple filed suit against the Company as well as against the then other present and former members of the Board of Directors in connection with these allegations. The Company believes that it has valid defenses in these matters and believes that no warrants are due to Mr. Kopple or his affiliates. The Company intends to vigorously defend against these claims and has been actively attempting to reach a resolution with Mr. Kopple. However, to-date, no settlement has been reached in large part because Mr. Kopple continues to demand that as part of any such settlement, he receive unilateral control over significant aspects of the Company\u2019s financial and management functions such as, but not limited to, the right to unilaterally direct the Company\u2019s ordinary business expenditures and requiring the Company to seek his approval for the hiring of nearly all personnel, all to the exclusion of the Company\u2019s management team and stockholder-elected Board of Directors. The Company believes that allowing Mr. Kopple such level of operational control over the Company without any accountability would be highly detrimental to the Company and is incompatible with the Board of Directors\u2019 duties to shareholders and creditors as a whole. However, if we are unable to reach and resolution with Mr. Kopple and Mr. Kopple were to prevail in his lawsuit, an adverse ruling on these claims would materially and adversely affect our business results or operating and financial condition, dilute our shareholders\u2019 equity interests in the Company and could adversely affect our stock price. See Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d, \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the transactions under dispute.\nOur business is not diversified. If we cannot increase market acceptance of our products, modify our products and services, or compete with new technologies, we may never be profitable.\nWe currently focus all of our resources on the successful commercialization of the AuraGen\u00ae family of products. Because we have elected to focus our business on a single product line rather than diversifying into other areas, our success will be dependent upon the commercial success of these products. If we are unable to increase market acceptance of our products, if we are unable to modify our products and services on a timely basis so that we lose customers, or if new technologies make our technology obsolete, we may never be profitable.\nMost of our competitors are larger and better financed than we are and have a greater presence in the marketplace. Our business may be adversely affected by industry competition.\nBoth in the U.S. and internationally, the industries in which we operate are extremely competitive. We face substantial competition from companies that have a long history of offering traditional auxiliary power units (portable generators), traditional automotive alternators, and inverters (a device that inverts battery direct current electricity to alternating current). Most of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources, spend considerably larger sums than we spend on research, new product development and marketing, and have long-standing customer relationships. Furthermore, we must compete with many larger and better-established companies in the hiring and retention of qualified personnel. Although we believe we have significant technological advantages over our competitors, realizing and maintaining such advantages will require us to develop customer relationships and will also depend on market acceptance of our products. We may not have the financial resources, technical expertise, or marketing and support capabilities to compete successfully, which would materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe may not be able to establish an effective distribution network or strategic OEM relationships; in which case our sales will not increase as expected and our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe are in the very beginning stages of developing our distribution network and establishing strategic relationships with original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers. We may not be able to identify appropriate distributors or OEM customers on a timely basis. The distributors with which we partner may not focus adequate resources on selling our products or may otherwise be unsuccessful in selling them. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to establish OEM relationships on favorable terms or at all. The lack of success of distributors or OEM customers in marketing our products would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to locate and lease a new facility for limited production, testing, warehousing, engineering and office space, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur current Stanton facility is not sufficient to support our expected operations in fiscal 2021. Accordingly, the Company is actively searching for a new facility that would be used for limited production, testing, warehousing and engineering and office space for support staff. The inability to locate a suitable facility could adversely affect our financial performance, business operations and growth. Appropriate locations or financing for the lease of a new facility may not be available at reasonable costs or at all. Our failure to secure a new facility will impede our business strategy.\nIf we are successful in executing our business plan to grow our business, our failure to efficiently manage our growth could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIf we are successful in executing our business plan, we may experience growth in our business that could place a significant strain on our management and other resources. Our ability to manage this growth will require us to successfully assimilate new employees, improve existing management information systems and reorganize our operations. If we fail to manage growth efficiently, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe may experience delays in product shipments and increased product costs because we depend on third party manufacturers for certain product components. Delays in product shipment or an inability to replace certain suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe currently do not have the capability to manufacture most of the AuraGen\u00ae components on a commercial scale. Therefore, we rely extensively on contracts with third party manufacturers for such components. The use of third-party manufacturers increases the risk of delay of shipments to our customers and increases the risk of higher costs if our manufacturers are not available when required. Our suppliers and manufacturers may not supply us with a sufficient number of components or components of adequate quality, which would delay production of our product. We do not currently have written agreements with any suppliers. Furthermore, those suppliers who make certain components may not be easily replaced. Any of these disruptions in the supply of components could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. Furthermore, we are monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the operations of the Company, particularly with respect to possible delays and other disruptions to the supply-chain.\nAlthough we generally aim to use standard parts and components for our products, some of our components are currently available only from limited sources.\nWe may experience delays in production of the AuraGen\u00ae if we fail to identify alternate vendors, or if any parts supply is interrupted or reduced or if there is a significant increase in production costs, each of which could materially adversely and affect our business and operations.\nWe will need to renew sources of component supplies to meet increases in demand for the AuraGen\u00ae. There is no assurance that our suppliers can or will supply the components to us on favorable terms or at all.\nAs we recommence our operations and in order to meet future demand for AuraGen\u00ae systems, we will need to renew contracts or form new contracts with our prior manufacturers and suppliers or locate other suitable manufacturers and suppliers for subassemblies and other components. Recently, we entered into discussions with several of our prior suppliers and we are in the process of negotiating settlements of old payables and arranging new supply contracts. Although we believe that there are a number of potential manufacturers and suppliers of the components, we cannot guarantee that contracts for components can be obtained on favorable terms or at all. Any material adverse change in terms of the purchase of these components could increase our cost of goods.\nWe need to invest in tooling to have a more extensive line of products. If we cannot expand our tooling, it may not be possible for us to expand our operations.\nWe are currently limited in the products that we are able to manufacture because of the limitations of our tooling capabilities. In order to have a broader line of products that address industrial and commercial needs, we must make a significant investment in additional tooling or pursue new alternatives to replace traditional tooling. We do not currently have the funds required to acquire new tooling or to obtain replacements and no assurances can be given that we will have the required funds in the future. If we do not acquire the required funds for tooling or replacement tooling, we may not be able to expand our product line to meet industrial and commercial needs.\nWe are subject to government regulation that may restrict our ability to use certain suppliers outside the U.S. or to sell our products into certain countries. If we cannot obtain the required approval from government agencies, then our business may be adversely affected.\nWe depend on third party suppliers for our parts and components, some of which are located outside of the United States. In the event that some of these suppliers are barred from selling their products in the United States, or cannot meet other U.S. government regulations, we would need to locate other suppliers, which could delay or prevent us from shipping product to our customers. We use copper, steel and aluminum in our product and in the event of government regulations or restrictions of these materials we may experience a shortage of these materials to manufacture our product. Furthermore, U.S. law restricts us from selling products in some potential foreign markets without U.S. government approval. If we cannot obtain the required approvals from government agencies to obtain materials or contract with suppliers or if we are restricted by government regulation from selling our products into certain countries, our business may be adversely affected.\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn March 2017, we entered into a joint venture agreement with a Chinese partner. This joint venture arrangement and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, or that they distract management from our other businesses. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements, such as increased revenue, enhanced efficiencies, or increased market share, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. These events could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition. During fiscal 2020, the Company recorded an impairment expense of $250,000 writing-off the Jiangsu Shengfeng investment due to operational and future cash-flow uncertainties associated with AuraGen\u00ae market development prospects in China through the joint venture\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire qualified personnel, we may not be able to grow effectively.\nOur performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. We are currently in default under several agreements with various key consultants which may make those parties unwilling to continue to work with the Company. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees and consultants. The incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees and consultants provided by our ability to pay competitive salaries and rates as well as offering additional incentives such as stock option grants or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past. If we do not succeed in attracting excellent personnel or retaining or motivating existing personnel, we may be unable to grow effectively.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes and other natural catastrophic events, and to interruptions by man-made problems such as computer viruses, terrorism, or pandemics.\nOur corporate headquarters and our research and development operations are located in the State of California in regions known for seismic activity. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, in this region could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could adversely affect our business and the market price of our Common Stock.\nPursuant to rules adopted by the SEC under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to assess the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and provide a management report on our internal controls over financial reporting in all annual reports. This report contains, among other matters, a statement as to whether our internal controls over financial reporting are effective and the disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting identified by management. Section 404 also requires our independent registered public accounting firm to audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nAs described in ITEM 9A, Controls and Procedures contained herein in this Annual Report, we have concluded that the material weakness that was previously disclosed on Form 10-K, as amended, for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, was successfully remediated during fiscal 2020. Presently, the Company does not have the financial resources to fully comply with all requirements of Section 404. If, in the future, we identify additional material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting during this continuous evaluation process, our management may not be able to assert that such internal controls are effective. Therefore, if we are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective in the future, or if our auditors are unable to attest that our internal controls are effective or they are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would have an adverse effect on our business and the market price of our Common Stock.\nTrading on the OTC Markets is volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares.\nOur common stock is quoted on the Pink Sheets of the OTC Markets. Trading in stock quoted on the OTC Markets is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors, some of which may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the OTC Markets is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTC Markets is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like NASDAQ or a stock exchange like the New York Stock Exchange. These factors may result in investors having difficulty reselling any shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 12122, "SIC": 3621, "TIC": "AUSI"}
