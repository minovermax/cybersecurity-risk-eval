{"cik": "1421517", "company": "Energy Recovery, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-08", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nThe following discussion sets forth what management currently believes could be the most significant risks and uncertainties that could impact our businesses, results of operations, and financial condition. Other risks and uncertainties, including those not currently known to the Company or its management, could also negatively impact our businesses, results of operations, and financial conditions. Accordingly, the following should not be considered a complete discussion of all of the risks and uncertainties the Company may face. We may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time in other reports we file with the SEC.\nRisk Related to our Water Segment\n\u2022\nOur Water Segment depends on the construction of new desalination plants for revenue, and as a result, our operating results have experienced, and may continue to experience, significant variability due to volatility in capital spending, availability of project financing, and other factors affecting the water desalination industry.\nWe currently derive the majority of our revenue from sales of products and services used in desalination plants for municipalities, hotels, mobile containerized desalination solutions, resorts, and agricultural operations in dry or drought-ridden regions of the world. The demand for our Water segment products may decrease if the construction of desalination plants declines for political, economic, or other factors, especially in these dry or drought-ridden regions. Other factors that could affect the number and capacity of desalination plants built or the timing of their completion include the availability of required engineering and design resources; a weak global economy; shortage in the supply of credit and other forms of financing; changes in government regulation, permitting requirements, or priorities; and reduced capital spending for desalination. Each of these factors could result in reduced or uneven demand for our Water segment products. Pronounced variability or delays in the construction of desalination plants or reductions in spending for desalination, could negatively impact our Water segment sales and revenue, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our entire business, financial condition, or results of operations and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast our future sales and revenue.\n\u2022\nOur Water segment faces competition from a number of companies that offer competing energy recovery and pump solutions. If any one of these companies produces superior technology or offers more cost-effective products, our competitive position in the market could be harmed and our profits may decline.\nThe market for ERD and pumps for desalination plants is competitive and evolving. We expect competition, especially competition on price, to persist and intensify as the desalination market grows and new competitors enter the market. Some of our current and potential competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources; longer operating histories; or greater name recognition. They may also have more extensive products and product lines that would enable them to offer multi-product or packaged solutions as well as competing products at lower prices or with other more favorable terms and conditions. As a result, our ability to sustain our market share may be adversely impacted, which would affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. In addition, if one of our competitors were to merge or partner with another company, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our continuing ability to compete effectively.\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to collect unbilled receivables, which are caused in part by holdback provisions, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur contracts with large engineering, procurement, and construction firms generally contain holdback provisions that typically delay final installment payments for our products by up to 24 months, after the product has been shipped and revenue has been recognized. Generally 10% or less of the revenue we recognize pursuant to our customer contracts is subject to such holdback provisions and is accounted for as unbilled receivables. Such holdbacks may result in relatively high unbilled receivables. If we are unable to collect these performance holdbacks, our results of operations would be adversely affected.\n- 14 -\n\u2022\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers for some of our components. If our suppliers are not able to meet our demand and/or requirements, our business could be harmed.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers for vessel housings, stainless steel ports, alumina powder, and tungsten carbide for our portfolio of PX ERDs and stainless steel castings and components for our turbochargers and pumps. Our reliance on a limited number of manufacturers for these supplies involves a number of risks, including reduced control over delivery schedules, quality assurance, manufacturing yields, production costs, and lack of guaranteed production capacity or product supply. We do not have long-term supply agreements with these suppliers but secure these supplies on a purchase order basis. Our suppliers have no obligation to supply products to us for any specific period, in any specific quantity, or at any specific price, except as set forth in a particular purchase order. Our requirements may represent a small portion of the total production capacities of these suppliers, and our suppliers may reallocate capacity to other customers, even during periods of high demand for our products. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, product quality issues and delivery delays with our suppliers due to factors such as high industry demand or the inability of our vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements. If our suppliers were to cancel or materially change their commitments to us or fail to meet quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products, we could lose time-sensitive customer orders, be unable to develop or sell our products cost-effectively or on a timely basis, if at all, and have significantly decreased revenue, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. We may qualify additional suppliers in the future, which would require time and resources. If we do not qualify additional suppliers, we may be exposed to increased risk of capacity shortages due to our dependence on current suppliers.\nRisk Related to our Oil & Gas Segment\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to successfully commercialize the VorTeq.\nIn October 2015, we entered into the VorTeq License Agreement with the VorTeq Licensee which provides the VorTeq Licensee with exclusive worldwide rights to our VorTeq technology for hydraulic fracturing onshore applications. Once the VorTeq is commercialized, the VorTeq Licensee will begin paying ongoing recurring royalty fees to us for the VorTeq technology. In order to commercialize the VorTeq, the VorTeq License Agreement provides, among other things, that we successfully meet certain specified milestones against key performance indicators set forth in the license agreement. The VorTeq is a relatively new technology and the hydraulic fracturing process is extremely complex which presents a wide range of technological challenges for us. If we are unable to successfully solve these challenges and, as a result, fail to meet the milestones, we may not be able to successfully commercialize the VorTeq. In that circumstance, we will not receive any royalty payments from the VorTeq Licensee, which could have an adverse effect on our entire business, financial condition, or results of operation.\n\u2022\nIf the VorTeq Licensee fails to adopt the VorTeq, for any reason, we may not receive royalty payments or be able to successfully commercialize the VorTeq.\nThe successful commercialization of the VorTeq depends heavily on the VorTeq Licensee\u2019s support and ultimate adoption of the technology. If the VorTeq Licensee fails to adopt the VorTeq, for any reason, we may not be able to successfully commercialize the VorTeq with the VorTeq Licensee and consequently, we may not receive any royalties under the VorTeq License Agreement. In addition, we may not be able to find a suitable replacement for the VorTeq Licensee or be able to negotiate royalties similar to those contained in the VorTeq License Agreement or to commercialize the VorTeq at all. Failure to commercialize the VorTeq could have an adverse effect on our entire business, financial condition, or results of operation.\n\u2022\nWe may not meet the key performance indicators necessary to meet the two milestones in the VorTeq License Agreement.\nThe VorTeq License Agreement calls for certain milestone key performance indicators that if met will result in payments to the Company of $25 million for each of two milestones. Achievement of these milestones is uncertain, and while we believe we can meet the milestones, if we are unable to do so, the milestone payments will be delayed until such time as the milestones are met or not earned and received at all. Failure to meet said milestones may also jeopardize commercialization and the rate of adoption of our VorTeq.\n- 15 -\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to successfully complete early stage testing of the MTeq, enter into a long term licensing agreement for the MTeq or fail to commercialize the MTeq.\nWe introduced the MTeq in 2017 and entered into a strategic early stage testing agreement in the second quarter of 2017. Like the VorTeq, we intend to find a long-term licensing partner for the MTeq and to ultimately commercialize the MTeq. The early stage testing agreement with Sidewinder Drilling is intended to validate the MTeq system through yard testing. However, the MTeq is a relatively new technology and those tests may prove unsuccessful. Even if early stage testing proves to be successful, we may not be able to identify a licensing partner for the technology to assist us in bringing the MTeq solution to the market. If we were able to enter into such a licensing agreement, we may still fail to produce a viable commercialized solution given the complex and extreme conditions found in mud pumping, which present a wide range of technological challenges for us. If we are unable to successfully complete early stage testing, or fail to locate and successfully negotiate a licensing or similar agreement with a long term partner, or fail to solve any of the technological challenges, we may not be able to successfully commercialize the MTeq, which could have an adverse effect on our entire business, financial condition, or results of operation.\n\u2022\nOur Oil & Gas segment may be impacted by prolonged deflation in global oil prices which may cause delays or cancellations of projects by Oil & Gas segment customers, negatively affecting the rate of our market penetration and consequently our revenue and profitability.\nA deflationary oil environment such as the one experienced over the last few years may delay and even stall adoption and deployment of our products within our Oil & Gas segment including but not limited to the VorTeq as licensed for onshore applications by the VorTeq Licensee. Emerging market economies, those dependent on commodity exports, and especially those for whom oil exports make up a significant percent of total exports, may be unable to retrofit or expand their oil exploration, production, and gas processing infrastructure thus negatively impacting our addressable market and future revenue. Additionally, oil price deflation may continue to lead to widespread liquidity and insolvency issues for exploration, production, and processing customers, which may negatively affect our addressable markets and therefore our financial performance.\n\u2022\nWithin our Oil & Gas segment, the use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting for the IsoBoost and IsoGen products requires us to make estimates and judgments, which are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and which may differ from actual results.\nThe IsoBoost and IsoGen systems are highly engineered, customized solutions that are designed and manufactured over an extended period of time and are built specifically to meet a customer\u2019s specifications. It is the Company\u2019s position that the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is appropriate for the IsoBoost and IsoGen systems given the facts and circumstances of these projects. This methodology requires the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating revenue and costs. Revenue and profits are recognized over the life of a project based on costs incurred to date compared to total estimated project costs. Revisions to revenues and profits are made once amounts are known and can be reasonably estimated. In addition, percentage-of-completion revenue may vary from quarter to quarter while a project is being completed due to accounting requirements. Given the uncertainties in accurately estimating the costs of projects, as well as providing reliable estimates to completion, it is possible for actual amounts to vary significantly from estimates previously made, which may result in the reversal of revenues and gross profit previously recognized and publicly reported.\n- 16 -\nRisk Related to our Entire Business\n\u2022\nOur diversification into new fluid flow markets, such as oil & gas, may not be successful\nWe have made a substantial investment in research, development, and sales to execute on our diversification strategy into fluid flow markets such as oil & gas and chemical processing. While we see diversification as core to our growth strategy, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in our efforts. Our model for growth is based on our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new markets, both in terms of geographies and product areas, and to drive broad adoption of the products and services that we develop and market. Any inability to execute this model for growth could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operation results. For example, while we believe that our products will enable gas processing plant operators to operate at a high level of energy efficiency with minimal downtime, we may be subject to warranty claims if customers of these offerings experience significant downtimes or failures for which our warranty reserves may be inadequate given the lack of historical failure rates associated with new product introductions. We also could be subject to damage claims based on our products against which we may not be able to properly insure. In addition, profitability, if any, in new industrial verticals may be lower than in our Water Segment, and we may not be sufficiently successful in our diversification efforts to recoup investments.\n\u2022\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, making our future operating results difficult to predict and causing our operating results to fall below expectations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control.\nWe have experienced significant fluctuations in revenue from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, and we expect such fluctuations to continue. In addition, in the past, customer buying patterns led to a significant portion of our sales occurring in the fourth quarter. This presents the risk that delays, cancellations, or other adverse events in the fourth quarter could have a substantial negative impact on annual results. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Since it is difficult for us to anticipate our future results, in the event our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, our stock price may decline.\n\u2022\nOur sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense. As a result, our sales are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from quarter to quarter, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate.\nOur sales efforts involve substantial education of our current and prospective customers about the use and benefits of our energy recovery products. This education process can be time-consuming and typically involves a significant product evaluation process which is particularly pronounced when dealing with product introduction into new fluid flow industrial verticals. In our Water segment, the sales cycle for our OEM customers, which are involved with smaller desalination plants, averages one to 12 months. The Water segment sales cycle for our international engineering, procurement, and construction firm customers, which are involved with larger desalination plants, ranges from 16 to 36 months. In our Oil & Gas segment, experience indicates that sales efforts are prolonged due in part to customers\u2019 reluctance to accept new technology, procurement processes, plant turnaround dates, and budgetary constraints. The sales cycle for our Oil & Gas segment customers ranges from 16 to 36 months. These long sales cycles make quarter-by-quarter revenue predictions difficult and results in our expending significant resources well in advance of orders for our products.\n\u2022\nOur business entails significant costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term while demand for our products is variable and subject to fluctuation, which may adversely affect our operating results.\nOur business requires investments in facilities, equipment, research and development, and training that are either fixed or difficult to reduce or scale in the short term. At the same time, the market for our products is variable and has experienced downturns due to factors such as economic recessions, increased precipitation, uncertain global financial markets, and political changes, many of which are outside of our control. During periods of reduced product demand, we may experience higher relative costs and excess manufacturing capacity, resulting in high overhead and lower gross profit margins while causing cash flow and profitability to decline. Similarly, although we believe that our existing manufacturing facilities are capable of meeting current demand and demand for the foreseeable future, the continued success of our business depends on our ability to expand our manufacturing, research and development, and testing facilities to meet market needs. If we are unable to respond timely to an increase in demand, our revenue, gross profit margin, net income, and cash flow may be adversely affected.\n- 17 -\n\u2022\nParts of our inventory may become excess or obsolete, which would increase our cost of revenues.\nInventory of raw materials, parts, components, work in-process, or finished products may accumulate, and we may encounter losses due to a variety of factors, including technological change in the water desalination and oil & gas industries that result in product changes; long delays in shipment of our products or order cancellations; our need to order raw materials that have long lead times and our inability to estimate exact amounts and types of items needed, especially with regard to the configuration of our high-efficiency pumps and IsoBoost and IsoGen systems; and cost reduction initiatives resulting in component changes within the products.\nIn addition, we may from time to time purchase more inventory than is immediately required in order to shorten our delivery time in case of an anticipated increase in demand for our products. If we are unable to forecast demand for our products with a reasonable degree of certainty and our actual orders from our customers are lower than these forecasts, we may accumulate excess inventory that we may be required to write off, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nWe may not generate positive returns on our research and development strategy.\nDeveloping our products is expensive and the investment in product development may involve a long payback cycle. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our R&D expenses were $13.4 million, or approximately 21% of our total revenue, $10.1 million, or approximately 19% of our total revenue, and $7.7 million, or approximately 17% of our total revenue, respectively. We expect to continue to invest heavily in R&D in order to introduce new products and achieve proof of concept of at least one new derivative of the pressure exchanger every year. We believe one of our greatest strengths lies in our innovation and our product development efforts. By investing in R&D, we believe we are well positioned to continue to execute on our product strategy, take into consideration our customers\u2019 cost and efficiency sensitivities and take advantage of other market opportunities. We expect that our results of operations may be impacted by the timing and size of these investments. In addition, these investments may take several years to generate positive returns, if ever.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to risks related to product defects, which could lead to warranty claims in excess of our warranty provision or result in a significant or a large number of warranty or other claims in any given year.\nWe provide a warranty for certain products for a period of 18 to 30 months and provide up to a 5-year warranty for the ceramic components of our PX-branded products. We test our products in our manufacturing facilities through a variety of means; however, there can be no assurance that our testing will reveal latent defects in our products, which may not become apparent until after the products have been sold into the market. The testing may not replicate the harsh, corrosive, and varied conditions of the desalination and other plants in which they are installed. It is also possible that components purchased from our suppliers could break down under those conditions. Certain components of our turbochargers and pumps are custom-made and may not scale or perform as required in production environments. Accordingly, there is a risk that we may have significant warranty claims or breach supply agreements due to product defects. We may incur additional cost of revenue if our warranty provisions are not sufficient to cover the actual cost of resolving issues related to defects in our products. If these additional expenses are significant, they could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\u2022\nBusiness interruptions may damage our facilities or those of our suppliers.\nOur operations and those of our suppliers may be vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, flood, and other natural disasters, as well as power loss, telecommunications failure, and other events beyond our control. Our facilities in California are located near major earthquake faults and have experienced earthquakes in the past. If a natural disaster occurs, our ability to conduct our operations could be seriously impaired, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We cannot be sure that the insurance we maintain against general business interruptions will be adequate to cover all of our losses.\n- 18 -\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to protect our technology or enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed, and we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights.\nOur competitive position depends on our ability to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and to protect our technology from copying by others. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright, and trademark laws, as well as confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, all of which may offer only limited protection. We hold a number of U.S. and counterpart international patents, and when their terms expire, we could become more vulnerable to increased competition. The protection of our intellectual property in some countries may be limited. While we have expanded our portfolio of patent applications, we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims, and even if patents are issued, they may be contested, circumvented, or invalidated. Moreover, while we believe our issued patents and patent pending applications are essential to the protection of our technology, the rights granted under any of our issued patents or patents that may be issued in the future may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages, and as with any technology, competitors may be able to develop similar or superior technologies now or in the future. In addition, our granted patents may not prevent misappropriation of our technology, particularly in foreign countries where intellectual property laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as those in the United States. This may render our patents impaired or useless and ultimately expose us to currently unanticipated competition. Protecting against the unauthorized use of our products, trademarks, and other proprietary rights is expensive, difficult, and in some cases, impossible. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Intellectual property litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, either of which could harm our business.\n\u2022\nClaims by others that we infringe their proprietary rights could harm our business.\nThird parties could claim that our technology infringes their intellectual property rights. In addition, we or our customers may be contacted by third parties suggesting that we obtain a license to certain of their intellectual property rights that they may believe we are infringing. We expect that infringement claims against us may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur. In addition, to the extent that we gain greater visibility, we believe that we will face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims. Any claim of infringement by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract management from our business. Furthermore, a party making such a claim, if successful, could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages. A judgment against us could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our products. In addition, we might be required to seek a license for the use of such intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Alternatively, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. Any of these events could seriously harm our business. Third parties may also assert infringement claims against our customers. Because we generally indemnify our customers if our products infringe the proprietary rights of third parties, any such claims would require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on their behalf in one or more jurisdictions, regardless of the merits of these claims. If any of these claims succeed, we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers.\n\u2022\nWe are currently involved in legal proceedings, and may be subject to additional future legal proceedings, that may result in material adverse outcomes.\nIn addition to intellectual property litigation risks discussed above, we are presently involved, and may become involved in the future, in various commercial and other disputes as well as related claims and legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the course of our business. See Note 16, \u201cLitigation,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about certain legal proceedings in which we are involved. Our current legal proceedings and any future lawsuits to which we may become a party are and will likely be expensive and time consuming to investigate, defend and resolve, and will divert our management\u2019s attention. Any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n- 19 -\n\u2022\nOur global operations expose us to risks and challenges associated with conducting business internationally, and our results of operations may be adversely affected by our efforts to comply with the laws of other countries, as well as U.S. laws which apply to international operations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and U.S. export control laws.\nWe operate on a global basis with offices or activities in Europe, Africa, Asia, South America, and North America. We face risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations. These laws and regulations include tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, export control laws, and laws which prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) or other anti-corruption laws that have recently been the subject of a substantial increase in global enforcement. Many of our products are subject to U.S. export law restrictions that limit the destinations and types of customers to which our products may be sold, or require an export license in connection with sales outside the United States. Given the high level of complexity of these laws, there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently or intentionally breached, for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements, or otherwise. Also, we may be held liable for actions taken by our local dealers and partners. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions or conditions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions or conditions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our business, and our operating results. In addition, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced significant governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business, licenses, or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence or through other methods that relevant law and regulations prohibit us from using. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties. These factors or any combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue or our overall financial performance.\n\u2022\nThe U.S. Congress and Trump Administration may make substantial changes to fiscal, political, regulation and other federal policies that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nChanges in general economic or political conditions in the United States or other regions could adversely affect our business. For example, the administration under President Donald Trump has indicated that it may propose significant changes with respect to a variety of issues, including international trade agreements, import and export regulations, tariffs and customs duties, foreign relations, immigration laws, tax laws, corporate governance laws and corporate fuel economy standards, that could have a positive or negative impact on our business. Proposals espoused by the Trump Administration may result in changes to social, political, regulatory, and economic conditions in the United States or in laws and policies affecting the development and investment in countries where we currently conduct business, sell our products, or procure our raw materials. In addition, these changes could result in negative sentiments towards the United States among non-U.S. customers. We cannot predict the impact, if any, of these changes to our business. However, it is possible that these changes could adversely affect our business due to the substantial exposure we have to international markets which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n\u2022\nRegulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (\u201cDRC\u201d) and adjoining countries. As a result, in August 2012, the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. Based on our purchasing policy and supplier selection, it is considered unlikely that any conflict minerals are used in the manufacturing of our products. Nevertheless, we are continuing reasonable country of origin inquiry and have implemented a program of due diligence on the source and chain of custody for conflict minerals. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including loss of customers and potential changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of our verification activities. The implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d minerals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary materials from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict-free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we have implemented.\n- 20 -\n\u2022\nWe may have risks associated with security of our information technology systems.\nWe make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information technology systems and data. Despite significant efforts to create security barriers to such systems, it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. There is a risk of industrial espionage, cyber-attacks, misuse or theft of information or assets, or damage to assets by people who may gain unauthorized access to our facilities, systems, or information. Such cybersecurity breaches, misuse, or other disruptions could lead to the disclosure of confidential information, improper usage and distribution of our intellectual property, theft, manipulation and destruction of private and proprietary data, and production downtimes. Although we actively employ measures to prevent unauthorized access to our information systems, preventing unauthorized use or infringement of our rights is inherently difficult. These events could adversely affect our financial results and any legal action in connection with any such cybersecurity breach could be costly and time-consuming and may divert management\u2019s attention and adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of us and our products.\n\u2022\nWe may have risks associated with our international tax optimization structure\nIn 2015, we implemented an international tax optimization structure. Subsidiaries were established in Ireland and we transferred our Oil & Gas segment intellectual property via platform licenses to ERI Energy Recovery Holdings Ireland Limited. We have undertaken extensive due diligence, implemented and continue to implement manufacturing, R&D, and sales operations to create Irish substance, and have conferred with tax experts to ensure that uncertain tax positions are unlikely. It is possible that the international tax structure could be examined by the Internal Revenue Service in the U.S. and/or the Tax Authorities in Ireland, and it is possible that such an examination could result in an unfavorable impact on us.\n\u2022\nThe enactment of legislation implementing changes in taxation of international business activities, the adoption of other corporate tax reform policies, or changes in tax legislation or policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.\nCorporate tax reform, base-erosion efforts and tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many tax jurisdictions where we have business operations. As a result, policies regarding corporate income and other taxes in numerous jurisdictions are under heightened scrutiny and tax reform legislation is being proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions. For example, on December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law \u201cH.R.1\u201d, known as the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d, (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), which significantly changes existing U.S. tax laws.\nIn addition, many countries are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation\u2019s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including changes to cross-border tax, transfer-pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentive practices. As a result of the heightened scrutiny of corporate taxation policies, prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities, and legislative investigation and inquiry, which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings. Any such changes in policies or rulings may also result in the taxes we previously paid being subject to change.\nDue to the scale of our international business activities any substantial changes in international corporate tax policies, enforcement activities or legislative initiatives may materially and adversely affect our business, the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our financial condition and results of operations generally.\n\u2022\nIf we need additional capital to fund future growth, it may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.\nOur primary source of cash historically has been customer payments for our products and services and proceeds from the issuance of common stock. This has funded our operations and capital expenditures. We may require additional capital from equity or debt financing in the future to fund our operations or respond to competitive pressures or strategic opportunities, such as a potential acquisition or the expansion of operations. We may not be able to secure such additional financing on favorable terms or at all. The terms of additional financing may place limits on our financial and operational flexibility. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities, or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new securities that we issue could have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of existing or future holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain necessary financing on terms satisfactory to us, if and when we require it, our ability to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges or opportunities could be significantly limited.\n- 21 -\n\u2022\nWe may seek to expand through acquisitions of and investments in other businesses, technologies, and assets. These acquisition activities may be unsuccessful or divert management\u2019s attention.\nWe may consider strategic and complementary acquisitions of and investments in other businesses, technologies, and assets, and such acquisitions or investments are subject to risks that could affect our business, including risks related to:\n\u2022\nthe necessity of coordinating geographically disparate organizations;\n\u2022\nimplementing common systems and controls;\n\u2022\nintegrating personnel with diverse business and cultural backgrounds;\n\u2022\nintegrating acquired research and manufacturing facilities, technology and products;\n\u2022\ncombining different corporate cultures and legal systems;\n\u2022\nunanticipated expenses related to integration, including technical and operational integration;\n\u2022\nincreased costs and unanticipated liabilities, including with respect to registration, environmental, health and safety matters, that may affect sales and operating results;\n\u2022\nretaining key employees;\n\u2022\nobtaining required government and third-party approvals;\n\u2022\nlegal limitations in new jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ninstalling effective internal controls and audit procedures;\n\u2022\nissuing common stock that could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders;\n\u2022\nspending cash and incurring debt;\n\u2022\nassuming contingent liabilities; and\n\u2022\ncreating additional expenses.\nWe may not be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or actually realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions or investments. Similarly, we may not be able to obtain financing for acquisitions or investments on attractive terms. If we do complete acquisitions, we cannot ensure that they will ultimately strengthen our competitive or financial position or that they will not be viewed negatively by customers, financial markets, investors, or the media. In addition, the success of any acquisitions or investments also will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the acquisition or investment with our existing operations.\n\u2022\nOur actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.\nWe release guidance in our quarterly earnings conference calls, quarterly earnings releases, or otherwise, regarding our future performance that represents our management\u2019s estimates as of the date of release. This guidance which, includes forward-looking statements, will be based on projections prepared by our management. These projections will not be prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our registered public accountants nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the projections. Accordingly, no such person will express any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect to the projections.\nProjections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. We will continue to state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to imply that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. The principal reason that we release guidance is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such third parties.\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results may vary from our guidance and the variations may be material. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged not to rely upon our guidance in making an investment decision regarding our common stock.\nAny failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could result in the actual operating results being different from our guidance and the differences may be adverse and material.\n- 22 -\n\u2022\nInsiders and principal stockholders will likely have significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval.\nOur directors, executive officers, and other principal stockholders beneficially own, in the aggregate, a substantial amount of our outstanding common stock. These stockholders could likely have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets.\n\u2022\nThe market price of our common stock may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile and subject to fluctuations. Changes in the stock market generally or as it concerns our industry, as well as geopolitical, economic, and business factors unrelated to us, may also affect our stock price. Significant declines in the market price of our common stock or failure of the market price to increase could harm our ability to recruit and retain key employees, reduce our access to debt or equity capital, and otherwise harm our business or financial condition. In addition, we may not be able to use our common stock effectively as consideration in connection with any future acquisitions.\n\u2022\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022\nauthorize our Board of Directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;\n\u2022\nrequire that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;\n\u2022\nspecify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our Board of Directors, the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer, or the president;\n\u2022\nestablish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nestablish that our Board of Directors is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II, and Class III, with each class serving staggered terms;\n\u2022\nprovide that our directors may be removed only for cause;\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our Board of Directors may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;\n\u2022\nspecify that no stockholder is permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors; and\n\u2022\nrequire a super-majority of votes to amend certain of the above mentioned provisions.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law regulating corporate takeovers. Section 203 generally prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder subject to certain exceptions.\n- 23 -", "PERMNO": 92753, "SIC": 3559, "TIC": "ERII"}
