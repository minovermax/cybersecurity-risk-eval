{"cik": "1544227", "company": "Millendo Therapeutics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as general economic and business risks and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The occurrence of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects or cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have made in this report and those we may make from time to time. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed below will not occur. Such risks may be amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential impact on our business and the global economy.\nRisks Related to Our Proposed Merger and Retention of Key Employees\nOur merger with Tempest may not be consummated or may not deliver the anticipated benefits we expect.\nIn 2020, we undertook a strategic review process, which was intended to result in an actionable plan that leverages our assets, capital and capabilities to maximize stockholder value. Following an extensive process of evaluating strategic alternatives and identifying and reviewing potential candidates for a strategic acquisition or other transaction, on March 29, 2021, we entered into a merger agreement with Tempest Therapeutics, Inc. (\u201cTempest\u201d), under which the privately held Tempest will merge with a wholly owned subsidiary of Millendo (the \u201cMerger\u201d). Pre-Merger Millendo shareholders will own approximately 18.5% of the combined company and pre-Merger Tempest stockholders will own approximately 81.5% of the combined company (assuming the financing transaction described in the Merger Agreement results in gross proceeds of approximately $30 million). We are devoting substantially all of our time and resources to consummating this transaction, however, there can be no assurance that such activities will result in the consummation of this transaction or that such transaction will deliver the anticipated benefits or enhance stockholder value.\nCertain provisions of the Merger Agreement may discourage third-parties from submitting alternative acquisition proposals, including proposals that may be superior to the arrangements contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nThe terms of the Merger Agreement prohibit each party from soliciting or engaging in discussions with third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals, except in limited circumstances when such party\u2019s board of directors determines in good faith that an unsolicited acquisition proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal and that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated by us or Tempest under certain circumstances, including because of a decision of our board of directors to accept a superior proposal, we would be required to pay Tempest a termination fee of $1.4 million or reimburse Tempest's expenses up to a maximum of $1.0 million. This termination fee may discourage third parties from submitting alternative takeover proposals to us or our stockholders, and may cause our board of directors to be less inclined to recommend an alternative proposal.\nThe announcement and pendency of the Merger, whether or not consummated, may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our business prospects.\nThe announcement and pendency of the Merger, whether or not consummated, may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our business prospects. In the event that the Merger is not completed, the announcement of the termination of the Merger Agreement may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our business prospects.\nFailure to consummate the Merger may result in us paying a termination fee to Tempest and could harm our common stock price and our future business and operations.\nThe Merger will not be consummated if the conditions precedent to the consummation of the transaction are not satisfied or waived, or if the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. If the Merger is not consummated, we are subject to the following risks:\n\u2022if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we will be required to pay Tempest a termination fee of $1.4 million or reimburse Tempest's expenses up to a maximum of $1.0 million; and\n\u2022the price of our common stock may decline and remain volatile.\nIf the Merger does not close for any reason, our board of directors may elect to, among other things, attempt to complete another strategic transaction, attempt to sell or otherwise dispose of our various assets, dissolve or liquidate our assets or seek to continue to operate our business. If we seek another strategic transaction or attempt to sell or otherwise dispose of our various assets, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so, that the terms would be equal to or superior to the terms of the Merger or as to the timing of such transaction. If we decide to dissolve and liquidate our assets, we would be required to pay all of our\ndebts and contractual obligations, and to set aside certain reserves for potential future claims, and there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of available cash left to distribute to stockholders after paying our debts and other obligations and setting aside funds for reserves.\nIf we were to seek to continue our business, we would need to determine whether to acquire one or more other product candidates. We would also need to raise funds to support continued operations and re-assess our workforce requirements in consideration of our reduced workforce.\nIf the Merger is not consummated, we may be unable to retain the services of key remaining members of our management team and, as a result, may be unable to seek or consummate another strategic transaction, properly dissolve and liquidate our assets or continue our business.\nIf we do not successfully consummate the transaction with Tempest, our board of directors may dissolve or liquidate our assets to pursue a dissolution and liquidation. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such transaction or liquidation.\nIf the Merger does not close for any reason, our board of directors may elect to, among other things, dissolve or liquidate our assets, which may include seeking protection from creditors in a bankruptcy proceeding. If we decide to dissolve and liquidate our assets, we would be required to pay all of our debts and contractual obligations, and to set aside certain reserves for potential future claims, and there can be no assurances as to the amount or timing of available cash left to distribute to stockholders after paying our debts and other obligations and setting aside funds for reserves.\nIn the event of a dissolution and liquidation, the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such decision and, ultimately, such liquidation, since the amount of cash available for distribution continues to decrease as we fund our operations in preparation for the consummation of the Merger. Further, the Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for each party, and provides that, upon termination under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Tempest a termination fee of $1.4 million or reimburse Tempest's expenses up to a maximum of $1.0 million, which would further decrease our available cash resources. If our board of directors were to approve and recommend, and our stockholders were to approve, a dissolution and liquidation, we would be required under Delaware corporate law to pay our outstanding obligations, as well as to make reasonable provision for contingent and unknown obligations, prior to making any distributions in liquidation to our stockholders. Our commitments and contingent liabilities may include (i) regulatory and clinical obligations remaining under our clinical trials; (ii) obligations under our employment, separation and retention agreements with certain employees that provide for severance and other payments following a termination of employment occurring for various reasons, including a change in control of us; and (iii) potential litigation against us, and other various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. As a result of this requirement, a portion of our assets may need to be reserved pending the resolution of such obligations. In addition, we may be subject to litigation or other claims related to a dissolution and liquidation of us. If a dissolution and liquidation were pursued, our board of directors, in consultation with our advisors, would need to evaluate these matters and make a determination about a reasonable amount to reserve. Accordingly, holders of our common stock could lose all or a significant portion of their investment in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up.\nAs a result of our decision to discontinue further investment in MLE-301 and the reductions in our workforce, we have only 12 employees remaining as of the date of this filing. If we are unable to retain certain of our remaining employees, our ability to consummate the planned Merger transaction may be delayed or seriously jeopardized.\nOn January 28, 2021, we announced workforce reductions, and current headcount has been reduced to 12 employees as of the date of this filing. Our cash conservation activities may yield unintended consequences, such as attrition beyond the planned workforce reductions and reduced employee morale, which may cause the remaining employees to seek alternate employment. Competition among biotechnology companies for qualified employees is intense, and the ability to retain the remaining employees is critical to our ability to effectively manage our business and to consummate the planned Merger transaction. Additional attrition could have a material adverse effect on our business and ability to consummate the Merger. In addition, as a result of the reduction in our workforce, we face an increased risk of employment litigation.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses and negative operating cash flows and there is no assurance that we will ever achieve or sustain profitability. Our net loss was $36.4 million and $44.6 million and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $245.1 million. We\nexpect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. We have devoted substantially all of our efforts to the acquisition of and preclinical and clinical development of MLE-301, in which we decided to discontinue our investment in January 2021, nevanimibe, in which we ceased investing in June 2020, and livoletide, of which we discontinued development in April 2020, as well as to building our management team and infrastructure. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We anticipate that our expenses may increase if we resume drug development activities. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease our value and could impair our ability to raise capital, continue our operations. A decline in our value also could cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nWe have a limited operating history and have never generated any revenue from product sales, which may make it difficult to assess our future viability.\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. Our operations to date, with respect to the development of our product candidates, have been limited to organizing and staffing the business, business planning, raising capital, acquiring our product candidates and other assets and conducting preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. We have not demonstrated an ability to successfully complete clinical development of a product candidate, obtain marketing approval, manufacture a commercial-scale drug (or arrange for a third-party to do so on our behalf), or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful commercialization. Consequently, our predictions about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had more experience developing product candidates.\nIf the Merger is not completed, we would need to raise substantial additional funding to the extent we resume our drug development efforts, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate our drug development efforts or other operations.\nIf the Merger is not completed, we may require substantial additional capital to fund any research and development and expenses related to our business. We had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $38.7 million at December 31, 2020. In the event that the Merger is not completed, we may pursue a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the company, or may seek to complete an alternate strategic transaction or may elect to resume investment in other product candidates. Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash will be sufficient to allow us to fund our current operating plan for at least the next 12 months.\nWe cannot predict to what extent we will resume drug development activities for any other drug product candidates. If we resume drug development activities, only a small minority of all research and development programs ultimately result in commercially successful drugs. Clinical failure can occur at any stage of clinical development and clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical or preclinical trials. In addition, data obtained from trials are susceptible to varying interpretations, and regulators may not interpret our data as favorably as we do, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will generate the same results or otherwise provide adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a drug candidate. Further, even if we complete the development for a drug product candidate and gain marketing approvals from the FDA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in a timely manner, we cannot be sure that such drug product candidate will be commercially successful in the pharmaceutical market. If the results of clinical trials, the anticipated or actual timing of marketing approvals, or the market acceptance of any drug product candidate, if approved, do not meet the expectations of investors or public market analysts, the market price of our common stock would likely decline. Further, if we resume drug development activities, we will need substantial additional financing to complete the development of any other drug product candidates we may develop.\nWe expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future. Our ability to achieve profitability in the future is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure. We may never achieve profitability, and unless and until we do, we will continue to need to raise additional capital. If we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of those securities could result in substantial dilution for our current stockholders and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our current stockholders, further diminishing current stockholders' ability to realize any value for their stock holdings. Furthermore, the issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline further and existing stockholders may not agree with our financing plans or the terms of such financings. There can be no assurances, however, that additional funding will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe will require additional capital to finance our operations, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Failure to obtain capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate certain of our development programs, future commercialization efforts or other operations.\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities and expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. As of December 31, 2020, our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $38.7 million. Our existing cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are currently expected to be sufficient to fund our current operating plans through at least the next 12 months. This cash runway guidance is based on our current operational plans and excludes any additional funding that may be received and business development activities that may be undertaken. In addition, our operating plans may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, including the short- and long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings, third-party funding, and marketing and distribution arrangements, as well as other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, or a combination of these approaches. In any event, we will require additional capital to pursue preclinical and clinical activities, regulatory approval and the commercialization of our current and future product candidates. Even if we believe we have sufficient capital for our current operating plans, we may seek additional capital if market conditions are favorable or if we have specific strategic considerations. If we elect to do so, additional capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Our ability to access additional capital, and as a result our operating results and liquidity needs, could be negatively affected by market fluctuations and economic downturn. The COVID-19 pandemic has already resulted in a significant disruption of global financial markets. If the disruption persists and deepens, we could experience an inability to access additional capital, which could negatively affect our business. Any additional capital raising efforts may divert our management from its day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our current and future product candidates.\nRaising additional capital by issuing equity or debt securities may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, and raising funds through lending and licensing arrangements may restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nUntil such time as we can generate substantial revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity and debt financings, strategic alliances and license and development agreements in connection with any future collaborations. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders\u2019 ownership may experience substantial dilution, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. Equity and debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as redeeming our shares, making investments, incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nThe incurrence of indebtedness could result in increased fixed payment obligations and we may be required to agree to certain restrictive covenants therein, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nIf we raise additional capital through collaborations, strategic alliances or third-party licensing arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our intellectual property, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional capital through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise develop and market ourselves.\nRisks Related to Development and Commercialization\nWe have never obtained marketing approval for a product candidate and we may be unable to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approval for any future product candidates that we may develop.\nWe have never obtained marketing approval for a product candidate. It is possible that the FDA may refuse to accept for substantive review any NDAs that we submit for any future candidates we may choose to develop or may conclude after review of our data that our application is insufficient to obtain marketing approval of our product candidates. If the FDA does not accept or approve our NDAs for any of our future product candidates, it may require that we conduct additional clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing validation studies and submit that data before it will reconsider our applications. Depending on the extent of these or any other FDA-required trials or studies, approval of any NDA or application that we submit may be delayed by several years or may require us to expend more resources than we have available. It is also possible that additional trials or studies, if performed and completed, may not be considered sufficient by the FDA to approve our NDAs.\nAny delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, marketing approvals would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates, generating revenues and achieving and sustaining profitability. If any of these outcomes occurs, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for our product candidates, which could significantly harm our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to a variety of risks associated with our international operations.\nSince the closing date of the merger we completed with OvaScience in 2018 (\u201cthe OvaScience Merger\u201d), we have been engaged in the process of winding up various subsidiaries of OvaScience, some or all of which are in foreign jurisdictions. We are also in the process of closing all other international subsidiaries. We expect to incur additional costs to complete these processes. Moreover, even if we successfully wind up these entities, we may be exposed to liability in these foreign jurisdictions as a result of their historical operations.\nIn addition, in December 2017, we acquired Aliz\u00e9 Pharma SAS (\u201cAliz\u00e9\u201d), a biopharmaceutical company based in Lyon, France. As of March 15, 2021, we had 12 employees located in the United States and one employee located in France. Our past and current global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal, tax and regulatory requirements, and violations or unfavorable interpretation by the respective authorities of these regulations could harm our business. Risks associated with international operations include the following, and these risks may be more pronounced if we seek to commercialize any future product candidates outside of the United States:\n\u2022reduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022foreign reimbursement, pricing and insurance regimes;\n\u2022workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022changes in diplomatic and trade relationships;\n\u2022anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, and its equivalent in foreign jurisdictions, such as the UK Bribery Act;\n\u2022production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u2022business interruptions resulting from pandemics and public health emergencies, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires.\nIn addition, there are complex regulatory, tax, labor, and other legal requirements imposed by both the European Union and many of the individual countries in and outside of Europe, with which we may need to comply.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and could limit commercialization of any future product candidate that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to our historical testing of product candidates. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that any such product candidates caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022decreased demand for any product candidate that we may develop;\n\u2022loss of revenue;\n\u2022substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022significant time and costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022the inability to commercialize any product candidate that it may develop;\n\u2022injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention; and\n\u2022increased marketing costs to attempt to overcome any injury to our reputation or negative media attention.\nIn addition, we face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to OvaScience\u2019s prior use of fertility treatments in humans. Product liability claims involving OvaScience\u2019s activities may be brought for significant amounts because OvaScience\u2019s potential fertility treatments involved mothers and children. For example, it is possible that we will be subject to product liability claims that assert that OvaScience\u2019s potential fertility treatments have caused birth defects in children or that such defects are inheritable. These claims could be made many years into the future based on effects that were not observed or observable at the time of birth. If we cannot successfully defend against claims that OvaScience\u2019s potential fertility treatments caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in, among other things, significant costs to defend the related litigation; substantial monetary awards or payments to trial participants or patients; loss of revenue; and the diversion of management\u2019s resources.\nAlthough we maintain product liability insurance coverage, such insurance may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We anticipate that we will need to increase our insurance coverage each time we commence a clinical trial and if we successfully commercialize any product candidate. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nIf OvaScience failed to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOvaScience was subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. OvaScience\u2019s prior operations involved the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. OvaScience\u2019s prior operations also produced hazardous waste products. OvaScience generally contracted with third-parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from OvaScience\u2019s use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nWe do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with OvaScience\u2019s storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Compliance\nRegulatory, legislative or self-regulatory/standard developments regarding privacy and data security matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nWe are subject to and affected by laws, rules, regulations and industry standards related to data privacy and security, and restrictions or technological requirements regarding the collection, use, storage, security, retention or transfer of data. In the United States, the rules and regulations to which we may be subject include federal laws and regulations enforced by the Federal Trade Commission, HHS, and state privacy, data security, and breach notification laws, as well as regulator enforcement positions and expectations. Internationally, governments and agencies have adopted and could in the future adopt, modify, apply or enforce additional laws, policies, regulations, and standards covering privacy and data security that may apply to our business. New regulation or legislative actions regarding data privacy and security (together with applicable industry standards) may increase our costs of doing business. In addition to privacy and data security regulations currently in force in the jurisdictions where we operate, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), went into effect in May 2018. The GDPR contains numerous requirements and changes from existing European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), law, including more robust obligations on data processors and data controllers and heavier documentation requirements for data protection compliance programs. Specifically, the GDPR will introduce numerous privacy-related changes for companies operating in the EU, including greater control over personal data-by-data subjects (e.g., the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d), increased data portability\nfor EU consumers, data breach notification requirements, and increased fines. The GDPR requirements apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries, including employee information. However, despite our ongoing efforts to bring our practices into compliance before the effective date of the GDPR, we may not be successful either due to various factors within our control, such as limited financial or human resources, or other factors outside our control. It is also possible that local data protection authorities may have different interpretations of the GDPR, leading to potential inconsistencies amongst various EU member states. Any failure or alleged failure (including as a result of deficiencies in our policies, procedures, or measures relating to privacy, data security, marketing, or communications) by us to comply with laws, regulations, policies, legal or contractual obligations, industry standards, or regulatory guidance relating to privacy or data security, may result in governmental investigations and enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties, additional regulatory oversight and reporting obligations or adverse publicity. Further, because of the work-from-home policies we implemented due to COVID-19, information that is normally protected, including company confidential information, may be less secure.\nWe expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards relating to privacy and data protection in the United States, the European Union, and in other jurisdictions, and we cannot determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. Future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations or any changed interpretation of existing laws or regulations could impair our ability to operate our business and negatively impact our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets.\nTo the extent we resume drug development activities, we will rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our product candidates. The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, or vice versa. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than United States law does. Further, we may not be aware of all third-party intellectual property rights potentially relating to our product candidates. Publications of discoveries in scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically published 18 months after filing, or in some cases, not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or product candidates, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and drugs. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nRecent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the \u201cLeahy-Smith Act\u201d), was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d), recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, only became effective on March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Any further changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents and patent applications or narrow the scope of our potential patent protection.\nMoreover, we may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the USPTO or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the\nscope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third-parties to commercialize our technology or product candidates and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize product candidates without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and product candidates, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and product candidates. Moreover, patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. Various extensions may be available; however, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Without patent protection for our current or future product candidates, we may be open to competition from generic versions of such drugs. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, we owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide it with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing drugs similar or identical to that of us.\nWe jointly own patents and patent applications with third-parties. Our ability to exploit or enforce these patent rights, or to prevent the third-party from granting licenses to others with respect to these patent rights, may be limited in some circumstances.\nWe jointly own certain patents and patent applications with third-parties. In the absence of an agreement with each co-owner of jointly owned patent rights, we will be subject to default rules pertaining to joint ownership. Some countries require the consent of all joint owners to exploit, license or assign jointly owned patents, and if we are unable to obtain that consent from the joint owners, we may be unable to exploit the invention or to license or assign our rights under these patents and patent applications in those countries. For example, we secured exclusive rights from the University of Michigan for certain patents and patent applications that they jointly own with us related to nevanimibe. Additionally, in the United States, each co-owner may be required to be joined as a party to any claim or action we may wish to bring to enforce these patent rights, which may limit our ability to pursue third-party infringement claims.\nWe have in-licensed patents and patent applications from third-parties. Our ability to exploit or enforce these patent rights, or to prevent the third-party from granting licenses to others with respect to these patent rights, may be limited in some circumstances.\nWe have in-licensed certain patents and patent applications from third-parties. In the absence of an agreement with each patent rights owner, we will be subject to default rules pertaining to ownership. Some countries require the consent of all owners to exploit, license or assign owned patents, and if we are unable to obtain that consent from the owners, we may be unable to exploit the invention or to license or assign our rights under these patents and patent applications in those countries. For example, we secured exclusive rights from Roche for certain patents and patent applications that they own related to MLE-301. Additionally, in the United States, each owner may be required to be joined as a party to any claim or action we may wish to bring to enforce these patent rights, which may limit our ability to pursue third-party infringement claims.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other government fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various government patent agencies outside of the United States in several stages over the lifetime of our owned and licensed patents and/or applications and any patent rights it may own or license in the future. We rely on our outside counsel or our licensing partners to pay these fees due to non-U.S. patent agencies. The USPTO and various non-U.S. government patent agencies require compliance with several procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply and we are also dependent on our licensors to take the necessary action to comply with these requirements with respect to our licensed intellectual property. In many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules.\nThere are situations, however, in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction.\nIn such an event, potential competitors might be able to enter the market and this circumstance would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time.\nGiven the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. We have in the past sought, and in the future may seek, extensions of patent terms in the United States and, if available, in other countries where we are prosecuting patents. In the United States, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 permits extension of the term of one U.S. patent that includes at least one claim covering the composition of matter of an FDA-approved drug, an FDA-approved method of treatment using the drug. The extended patent term cannot exceed the shorter of five years beyond the non-extended expiration of the patent or 14 years from the date of the FDA approval of the drug. However, the applicable authorities, including the FDA and the USPTO in the United States, and any equivalent regulatory authority in other countries, may not agree with our assessment of whether such extensions are available, and may refuse to grant extensions to our patents, or may grant more limited extensions than we request. Further, we may not elect to extend the most beneficial patent to us or the claims underlying the patent that we choose to extend could be invalidated. If any of the foregoing occurs, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our investment in development and clinical trials by referencing its clinical and preclinical data and launch their drug earlier than might otherwise be the case.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our business.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations and may not adequately protect our business. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u2022others may be able to make compounds or formulations that are similar to our formulation but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or control;\n\u2022we or any strategic partners might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patents or pending patent applications that we own or control;\n\u2022we might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\u2022others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022it is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n\u2022issued patents that we own or control may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges;\n\u2022our competitors might conduct research and development activities in the United States and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for certain research and development activities, as well as in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive drugs for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u2022we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and\n\u2022the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nThird-parties may initiate legal proceedings, which are expensive and time consuming, alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse impact on the success of our business.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive and complex litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. We may in the future become party to, or be threatened with, adversarial proceedings or\nlitigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to any future product candidates and technology, including interference proceedings, post grant review and inter partes review before the USPTO. Third-parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future, regardless of their merit. There is a risk that third-parties may choose to engage in litigation with us to enforce or to otherwise assert their patent rights against us. Even if we believe such claims are without merit, a court of competent jurisdiction could hold that these third-party patents are valid, enforceable and infringed, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to commercialize any future product candidates. In order to successfully challenge the validity of any such U.S. patent in federal court, we would need to overcome a presumption of validity. As this burden is a high one requiring us to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of any such U.S. patent claim, there is no assurance that a court of competent jurisdiction would invalidate the claims of any such U.S. patent. If we are found to infringe a third-party\u2019s valid and enforceable intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third-party to continue developing, manufacturing and marketing our product candidate and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors and other third-parties access to the same technologies licensed to us, and it could require us to make substantial licensing and royalty payments. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease developing, manufacturing and commercializing the infringing technology or product candidate. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent or other intellectual property right. A finding of infringement could prevent us from manufacturing and commercializing any future product candidates or force us to cease some or all of our business operations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third-parties could have a similar material adverse effect on our business. Even if we prevail in such infringement claims, patent litigation can be expensive and time consuming, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, the patents of our licensors or our other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe or otherwise violate our patents, the patents of our licensors or our other intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file legal claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensors is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of ours patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. The initiation of a claim against a third-party may also cause the third-party to bring counter claims against us such as claims asserting that our patents are invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, non-enablement or lack of statutory subject matter. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant material information from the USPTO, or made a materially misleading statement, during prosecution. Third-parties may also raise similar validity claims before the USPTO in post-grant proceedings such as ex parte reexaminations, inter partes review, or post-grant review, or oppositions or similar proceedings outside the United States, in parallel with litigation or even outside the context of litigation. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. We cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. For the patents and patent applications that we have licensed, we may have limited or no right to participate in the defense of any licensed patents against challenge by a third-party. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of any future patent protection on our current or future product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection could have material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. Any litigation or other proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights may fail, and even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. Even if we prevail in such infringement claims, patent litigation can be expensive and time consuming, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nChanges in U.S. patent law or the patent law of other countries or jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our product candidates.\nThe United States has recently enacted and implemented wide-ranging patent reform legislation. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on actions by the U.S. Congress, federal courts, USPTO, and the relevant law-making bodies in other countries, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce patents that we have licensed or that we might obtain in the future. Similarly, changes in patent law and regulations in other countries or jurisdictions or changes in the governmental bodies that enforce them or changes in how the relevant governmental authority enforces patent laws or regulations may weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce patents that we have licensed or that we may obtain in the future.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents covering any future product candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop our own drugs and, further, may export otherwise infringing drugs to territories where we may obtain patent protection, but where patent enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These drugs may compete with our drugs in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued or licensed patents and any future patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of their former employers or other third-parties.\nCertain of our employees, consultants or advisors are currently, or were previously, employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants and advisors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these individuals or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such individual\u2019s current or former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIn addition, while it is our approach to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. The assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing or the assignment agreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third-parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third-Parties\nWe may in the future enter into collaborations with third-parties to develop our product candidates. If these collaborations are not successful, our business could be harmed.\nWe may enter into collaborations with third-parties in the future. We may in the future determine to collaborate with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for development and potential commercialization of our product candidates. These relationships, or those like them, may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near- and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders or disrupt our management and business. In addition, we could face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Our ability to reach a definitive collaboration agreement will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of several factors. If we license rights to our product candidates, we may not be able to realize the benefit of such transactions if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture.\nIf any such potential future collaborations do not result in the successful development and commercialization of product candidates, or if one of our future collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may not receive any future research funding or milestone or royalty payments under the collaboration. If we do not receive the funding we expect under these agreements, the development of our product candidates could be delayed and we may need additional resources to develop our product candidates. In addition, if one of our future collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to attract new collaborators and the perception of us in the business and financial communities could be adversely affected. All of the risks relating to product development, regulatory approval and commercialization apply to the activities of our potential future collaborators.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Employee Matters\nOur business, preclinical studies and clinical development programs and timelines, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic.\nA novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, causing COVID-19, has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in travel and other restrictions in order to reduce the spread of the disease, including state and local orders across the country, which, among other things, direct individuals to shelter at their places of residence, direct businesses and governmental agencies to cease non-essential operations at physical locations, prohibit certain non-essential gatherings, and order cessation of non-essential travel. In response to these public health directives and orders, we have implemented work-from-home policies for certain employees. The effects of the executive orders, the shelter-in-place orders and our work-from-home policies may negatively impact productivity, disrupt our business and delay our clinical programs and timelines, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course. These and similar, and perhaps more severe, disruptions in our operations could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nQuarantines, shelter-in-place and similar government orders related to COVID-19 may adversely impact our business operations and the business operations of our contract research organizations conducting our clinical trials and our third-party manufacturing facilities in the United States and other countries. In particular, some of our third-party manufacturers which we use for the supply of materials for product candidates or other materials necessary to manufacture product to conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials are located in countries affected by COVID-19, and should they experience disruptions, such as temporary closures or suspension of services, we would likely experience delays in advancing these tests and trials.\nThe spread of COVID-19, which has caused a broad impact globally, may materially affect us economically. While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, a widespread pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nThe global pandemic of COVID-19 continues to rapidly evolve. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, our clinical development and regulatory efforts will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing requirements and business closures in the United States and other countries, and business disruptions, and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease. Accordingly, we do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our clinical and regulatory activities, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, these impacts could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIn addition, to the extent the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks and uncertainties described in this \u2018\u2018Risk Factors\u2019\u2019 section.\nWe are highly dependent on the services of our key executives and personnel, including Louis Arcudi III, our chief executive officer and Jennifer Minai-Azary, our chief financial officer and if we are not able to retain these members of our management team or recruit and retain additional management or personnel, our business will be harmed.\nWe are highly dependent on Mr. Arcudi and Ms. Minai-Azary. The employment agreements we have with these officers do not prevent such persons from terminating their employment with us at any time. Further, these officers may be unable to perform their duties or have limited availability due to COVID-19 or other health emergencies. The temporary or permanent loss of the services of any of these persons could impede the achievement of our corporate objectives.\nTo the extent we resume drug development activities, we will also be dependent on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified additional management and personnel. If we are not able to retain our management and to attract, on acceptable terms, additional qualified personnel necessary for the continued development of our business, we may not be able to sustain our operations or grow.\nWe may not be able to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses. Many of the other pharmaceutical companies that we compete against for qualified personnel and consultants have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles, are located in geographies with a larger biotechnology industry presence and a longer history in the industry than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high-quality candidates and consultants than what we have to offer. If we are unable to continue to attract, retain and motivate high-quality personnel and consultants to accomplish our business objectives, the rate and success at which we can discover and develop product candidates and our business will be limited and we may experience constraints on our development objectives.\nWe have recently reduced the size of our organization, and we may encounter difficulties in managing our business as a result of this reduction, or the attrition that may occur following this reduction, which could disrupt our operations. In addition, we may not achieve anticipated benefits and savings from the reduction.\nIn January 2021, we began the implementation of a reduction in force that will reduce the number of our employees by up to 85 percent. The reduction in force, and the attrition thereafter, resulted in the loss of longer-term employees, the loss of institutional knowledge and expertise and the reallocation and combination of certain of roles and responsibilities across the organization, all of which could adversely affect our operations. Given the complexity and nature of our business, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, manage our facilities and continue to recruit and retain qualified personnel. This will be made more challenging given the reduction in force described above and additional measures we may take to reduce costs. As a result, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day strategic and operational activities, and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these organizational changes. Further, the restructuring and possible additional cost containment measures may yield unintended consequences, such as attrition beyond our intended reduction in force and reduced employee morale. In addition, employees who were not affected by the reduction in force may seek alternate employment which would result in us seeking contract support at unplanned additional expense. In addition, we may not achieve anticipated benefits from the reduction in force. Due to our limited resources, we may not be able to effectively manage our operations or recruit and retain qualified personnel, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure and operations, risks that we may not be able to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. If our management is unable to effectively manage this transition and reduction in force and additional cost containment measures, our expenses may be more than expected, and we may not be able to implement our business strategy.\nOur employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, commercial collaborators, service providers and other vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including historical noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or the regulations applicable in other jurisdictions, provide accurate information to the FDA and other regulatory authorities, comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Such misconduct also could involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials or interactions with the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from government investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending itself or asserting our rights, those actions could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nWe may be delayed in our receipt of certain tax benefits that Aliz\u00e9 historically received as a French technology company.\nAs a French technology company, Aliz\u00e9 historically benefited from certain tax advantages, including the French research tax\ncredit (credit d\u2019impot recherche) (\u201cCIR\u201d). The CIR is a French tax credit aimed at stimulating research and development and can offset French corporate income tax due. Aliz\u00e9 has historically received CIR reimbursements promptly following filing for such reimbursements with applicable French taxing authorities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, claims were made totaling $1.3 million, which we received in the third quarter of 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019, claims were made totaling $1.3 million, which we received in the second quarter of 2020. In the future, we may no longer qualify as a French small or medium size enterprise, and, accordingly, we may be subject to a three-year waiting period for reimbursement of CIRs, which could adversely affect the combined business\u2019s results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the amount of CIR received is, among other factors, dependent upon incurring qualified research and development expenses and maintaining a certain level of employee salaries and other personnel costs in France. The number of our research and development employees in France decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020 and we experienced a decrease in qualified research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the discontinuation of our livoletide program. We plan to dissolve our subsidiary in France.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our collaborators or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs.\nOur internal computer systems and those of our current and any future collaborators and other contractors or consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we are not aware of any such material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations, whether due to a loss of our trade secrets or other proprietary information or other similar disruptions. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability, our competitive position could be harmed and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed.\nWe may be exposed to significant foreign exchange risk.\nWe incur portions of our expenses, and may in the future derive revenue, in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, in particular, the euro. As a result, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Any fluctuation in the exchange rate of these foreign currencies may negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results. Global economic events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have and may continue to significantly impact local economies and the foreign exchange markets, which may increase the risks associated with sales denominated in foreign currencies. We currently do not engage in hedging transactions to protect against uncertainty in future exchange rates between particular foreign currencies and the euro. Therefore, for example, an increase in the value of the euro against the U.S. dollar could be expected to have a negative impact on our operating expenses as euro denominated expenses, if any, would be translated into U.S. dollars at an increased value. We cannot predict the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and foreign currency fluctuations in the future may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe risks arising with respect to the historic OvaScience business and operations may be different from what we anticipate, which could lead to significant, unexpected costs and liabilities and could materially and adversely affect our business going forward.\nIt is possible that we may not have fully anticipated the extent of the risks associated with the OvaScience Merger we completed with OvaScience in 2018. After the OvaScience Merger, OvaScience\u2019s historic business was discontinued, but prior to the transaction OvaScience had a significant operating history. As a consequence, we may be subject to claims, demands for payment, regulatory issues, costs and liabilities that were not and are not currently expected or anticipated. Notwithstanding our exercise of due diligence pre-transaction and winding down of the OvaScience business post-transaction, the risks involved with taking over a business with a significant operating history and the costs and liabilities associated with these risks may be greater than we anticipate. We may not be able to contain or control the costs or liabilities associated with OvaScience\u2019s historic business, which could materially and adversely affect our business, liquidity, capital resources or results of operation.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock and Our Status as a Public Company\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors. A number of factors could influence the volatility in the trading price of our common stock, including changes in the economy or in the financial markets, including recently in connection with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, industry-related developments, and the impact of material events and changes in our operations, including as a result of our recent announcements that we have discontinued our livoletide program in PWS and ceased investing in our nevanimibe program and our MLE-301 program. Worsening economic conditions and other adverse effects or developments relating to our business or the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. The market price for our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile, particularly due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market, industry and other factors, including the risk factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price paid for the shares. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022announcements and market perceptions related to the Merger;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock;\n\u2022conditions or trends in our industry;\n\u2022changes in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022stock market price and volume fluctuations of comparable companies and, in particular, those that operate in the biopharmaceutical industry;\n\u2022publication of research reports about us or our industry or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures;\n\u2022announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;\n\u2022investors\u2019 general perception of our company and our business;\n\u2022recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022overall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022significant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u2022general political and economic conditions; and\n\u2022other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn addition, in the past, stockholders have initiated class action lawsuits against pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of these companies\u2019 stock. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our share price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time, subject to the restrictions and limitations described below. If our stockholders sell, or the market perceives that our stockholders intend to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, and significant stockholders, may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2020, we had 18,999,701 shares of common stock outstanding. All of our outstanding shares of common stock are available for sale in the public market, subject only to the restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. In addition, the shares of common stock subject to outstanding options under our equity incentive plans and the shares reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans will become eligible for sale in the public market in the future, subject to certain legal and contractual limitations. In addition, certain holders of our common stock have the right, subject to various conditions and limitations, to request we include their shares of our common stock in registration statements we may file relating to our securities.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our common stockholders might otherwise receive a premium price for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022establish a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board are elected at one time;\n\u2022allow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u2022limit the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from the board;\n\u2022establish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and for nominations to our board of directors;\n\u2022limit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u2022prohibit actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u2022require that stockholder actions be effected at a duly called stockholders meeting;\n\u2022authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and\n\u2022require the approval of the holders of at least 75 percent of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation or by-laws.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns 15 percent or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired 15 percent or more of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a manner prescribed by the statute.\nConcentration of ownership of our common stock among our existing executive officers, directors and principal stockholders may prevent our other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nAs of March 1, 2021, our executive officers, directors and current beneficial owners of 5% or more of our common stock and their respective affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially own approximately 34.5% of our outstanding common stock. As a\nresult, these persons, acting together, can significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors, any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other significant corporate transactions.\nSome of these persons or entities may have interests different than yours. For example, because many of these stockholders purchased their shares at prices substantially below the current market price of our common stock and have held their shares for a longer period, they may be more interested in selling our company to an acquirer than other investors, or they may want us to pursue strategies that deviate from the interests of other stockholders.\nWe are at risk of securities class action and similar litigation.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of our securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because biopharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. We remain the subject of various securities class action lawsuits and shareholder derivative lawsuits that were filed against OvaScience and certain of its officer and directors, as described in more detail in Item 3, Legal Proceedings. These lawsuits, as well as any similar lawsuits initiated in the future, could result in substantial cost and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the rules and regulations of the stock market on which our common stock is listed. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting and that we furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. However, due to recent changes in SEC rules related to smaller reporting companies, we are not required to have our auditors formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in connection with this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we were unable to conduct the required assessment primarily due to the OvaScience Merger occurring in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the substantial change in operational focus, management and the internal control environment following the OvaScience Merger. As a result, we provided our first internal control assessment with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nWe may identify weaknesses in our system of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements. Our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected.\nIf we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, or if we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements. If that were to happen, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), or other regulatory authorities.\nWe expect to continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance with our public company responsibilities and corporate governance practices.\nAs a relatively new public company, we continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies. Our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to compliance with these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, compared to when we were a private company, which could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors. We cannot predict or\nestimate the amount of additional costs we will continue to incur as a public company or the timing of such costs.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations could materially adversely affect our company.\nNew tax laws or regulations could be enacted at any time, and existing tax laws or regulations could be interpreted, modified or applied in a manner that is adverse to us, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. For example, legislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Act, enacted many significant changes to the U.S. tax laws, including changes in corporate tax rates, the utilization of our NOLs and other deferred tax assets, the deductibility of expenses, and the taxation of foreign earnings. Future guidance from the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities with respect to the Tax Act may affect us, and certain aspects of the Tax Act could be repealed or modified in future legislation. For example, the CARES Act modified certain provisions of the Tax Act. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act, the CARES Act, or any newly enacted federal tax legislation. The impact of changes under the Tax Act, the CARES Act, or future reform legislation could increase our future U.S. tax expense and could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nOur effective tax rate may fluctuate, and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of accrued amounts.\nWe are subject to taxation in more than one tax jurisdiction. As a result, our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places that we operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of such places. Nevertheless, our effective tax rate may be different than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including passage of the newly enacted federal income tax law, changes in the mix of our profitability from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the results of examinations and audits of our tax filings, our inability to secure or sustain acceptable agreements with tax authorities, changes in accounting for income taxes, cash repatriation restrictions and possible withholding taxes and changes in tax laws. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations and may result in tax obligations in excess of amounts accrued in our financial statements.\nOur ability to use net operating losses and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income may be subject to limitation.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) of $330.8 million and $280.9 million, respectively. Our NOLs could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities because of their limited duration or because of restrictions under U.S. tax law. Our NOLs generated in tax years ending on or prior to December 31, 2017 are permitted to be carried forward for only 20 years under applicable U.S. tax law. Our federal NOLs generated in tax years ending after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of federal NOLs generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2020 is subject to certain limitations. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act. Our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire, if not utilized, by 2031.\nIn addition, under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d its ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. A Section 382 \u201cownership change\u201d generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points (by value) over their lowest ownership percentage over a rolling three-year period. We may have experienced ownership changes in the past and may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of shifts in our stock ownership, such as the Merger with Tempest, or other changes (some of which are outside our control). As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOLs to offset such taxable income may be subject to limitations. Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply to limit our use of accumulated state tax attributes. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\nConsequently, even if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes, which could have a material adverse effect on cash flow and results of operations.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nYou should not rely on an investment in our common stock to provide dividend income. We have not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock to date. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of any existing or future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends.\nAs a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.", "PERMNO": 13883, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "MLND"}
