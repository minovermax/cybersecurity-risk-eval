In addition to the other information in this report, you should consider carefully the following risk factors in evaluating us and our business. Moreover, the risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nMaterial changes in the life insurance secondary market, a relatively new and evolving market, may adversely affect our operating results, business prospects and our ability to repay our debt obligations.\nOur sole business is the purchase and ownership of life insurance policies acquired in the secondary market, which is a relatively new and evolving market. The success of our business and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations depends in large part on the continued development of the secondary market for life insurance, including the solvency of life insurance companies to pay the face value of the life insurance benefits, both of which will critically impact the performance of the life insurance policy assets we own. We expect that the development of the secondary market will primarily be impacted by a variety of factors such as the interpretation of existing laws and regulations (including laws relating to insurable interests), the passage of new legislation and regulations, mortality improvement rates, and actuarial understandings and methodologies. Importantly, all of the factors that we believe will most significantly affect the development of the life insurance secondary market are beyond our control. Any material and adverse development in the life insurance secondary market could adversely affect our operating results, our access to capital, our ability to repay our various debt and other obligations, and our business prospects and viability. Because of this, an investment in our securities generally involves greater risk as compared to investments offered by companies with more diversified business operations in more established markets.\nWe have a relatively limited history of operations and our earnings and cash flows may be volatile, resulting in uncertainty about our ability to service and repay our debt when and as it comes due.\nWe are a company with a limited history, which makes it difficult to accurately forecast our earnings and cash flows. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred a net loss of $6.0 million, and in the year ended December 31, 2013, we incurred a net loss of $0.2 million. Our lack of a significant history and the evolving nature of the market in which we operate make it likely that there are risks inherent in our business that are yet to be recognized by us or others, or not fully appreciated, and that could result in us earning less than we anticipate or even suffering further anticipated or unanticipated losses. As a result of the foregoing an investment in our company\u2019s securities necessarily involves uncertainty about the stability of our earnings, cash flows and, ultimately, our ability to service and repay our debt. In addition, any earnings volatility we experience may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe valuation of our principal assets on our balance sheet requires us to make material assumptions that may ultimately prove to be incorrect. In such an event, we could suffer significant losses that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and eventually cause us to be in default of restrictive covenants contained in our borrowing agreements.\nOur principal asset is a portfolio of life insurance policies purchased in the secondary market, comprising approximately 88% of our total assets at December 31, 2014 and 85% of our total assets at December 31, 2013. Those assets are considered \u201cLevel 3\u201d fair value measurements under ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, as there is currently no active market where we are able to observe quoted prices for identical assets. As a result, our valuation of those assets on our balance sheet incorporates significant inputs that are not observable. Fair value is defined as an exit price representing the amount that would be received if assets were sold or that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.\nA Level 3 fair value measurement is inherently uncertain and creates additional volatility in our financial statements that is not necessarily related to the performance of the underlying assets. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we estimated the fair value discount rate for our portfolio to be 11.43% and 11.69%, respectively. If in the future we determine that a higher discount rate is required to ascribe fair value to a similarly situated portfolio of life insurance policies, we could experience significant losses materially affecting our results of operations. It is also possible that significant losses of this nature could at some point cause us to fall out of compliance with borrowing covenants contained in our various borrowing agreements. This could result in acceleration of our loan balances under the revolving credit facility or securities issued under our indenture, such as our Series I Secured Notes and our L Bonds, which we may not be able to repay. As a result, we may be forced to seek additional debt or equity financing to repay such debt amounts, and additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to repay our debt when it comes due, then our senior lender or the holders of our Series I Secured Notes and L Bonds, or both would have the right to foreclose on our assets.\nWe report non-GAAP financial measures to our lender under our revolving credit facility pursuant to financial covenants in the related borrowing documents. This presents operating results not subject to the valuation volatility associated with the discount rate we choose, thus presenting the actuarial performance we expect within our portfolio of life insurance policies at the expected internal rate of return against the costs we incur over the same period. Nevertheless, our reported GAAP earnings may in the future be volatile for reasons that do not bear an immediate relationship to the cash flows we experience.\nFor further disclosure relating to the risks associated with the valuation of our assets, see the risk factor below \u201cIf actuarial assumptions we obtain from third-party providers . . . .\u201d\nOur actual results from our life insurance portfolio may not match our expected results, which could adversely affect our ability to service and grow our portfolio for diversification.\nOur business model relies on achieving actual results that are in line with the results we expect to attain from our investments in life insurance policy assets. In this regard, we believe that the larger the portfolio we own, the greater the likelihood that we will achieve our expected results. To our knowledge, rating agencies generally suggest that portfolios of life insurance policies containing enough policies on individual lives to achieve actuarial stability in receiving expected cash flows from underlying mortality. For instance, in a study published in 2012, A.M. Best concluded that at least 300 lives are necessary to narrow the band of cash flow volatility and achieve actuarial stability, while Standard & Poor\u2019s has indicated that stability is unlikely to be achieved with a pool of less than 1,000 lives. As of December 31, 2014, we owned $779 million in face value of life insurance policies covering 265 lives. Accordingly, while there is a risk with a portfolio of any size that actual yield may be less than expected; we believe that the risk we face is presently more significant given the size of our current portfolio as compared to rating agency recommendations.\nAlthough we plan to expand the number of life insurance policies we own using proceeds raised from our continuous offering of L Bonds, we may be unable to meet this goal if sufficient financing from capital sources is not available or is available only on unfavorable or unacceptable terms. Furthermore, even if our portfolio reaches the size we desire, we still may experience differences between the actuarial models we use and actual mortalities.\nDifferences between our expectations and actuarial models on the one hand, and actual mortality results on the other hand, could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results and cash flow. In such a case, we may face liquidity problems, including difficulties servicing our remaining portfolio of policies and servicing our outstanding debt obligations. Continued or material failures to meet our expected results could decrease the attractiveness of our securities in the eyes of potential investors making it even more difficult to obtain capital needed to service our portfolio, grow the portfolio to obtain desired diversification, and service our existing debt.\nWe critically rely on debt financing for our business. Any inability to borrow could adversely affect our business operations, our ability to satisfy our obligations under the debentures and, ultimately, our viability.\nTo date, we have chosen to finance our business principally through the issuance of debt, including debt incurred by DLP II under a senior revolving credit facility provided by Autobahn/DZ Bank (which we refer to throughout this report as our \u201crevolving credit facility\u201d), our Series I Secured Notes and our L Bonds. Our revolving credit facility is secured by all of the assets of DLP II, has a maximum amount of $100 million, and the outstanding balance at December 31, 2014 was approximately $72 million. Obligations under the revolving credit facility have a scheduled maturity date of December 31, 2016, and obligations under our Series I Secured Notes and L Bonds have scheduled maturities as indicated below in the risk factor \u201cIf a significant number of holders . . . .,\u201d Our debt arrangements comprise the most important sources of financing on which our business critically relies to grow our portfolio life insurance policies and maintain those policies.\nOur business model expects that we will have continued access to financing to enable us to purchase a large and diversified portfolio of life insurance policies and pay the attendant premiums and costs of maintaining the portfolio, all while satisfying our current interest and principal repayment obligations under our revolving credit facility and other indebtedness. We expect to refinance our revolving credit facility, either through renewal or replacement, when it comes due on December 31, 2016. Pending the due date or refinancing of our revolving credit facility, we expect that proceeds from our life insurance policies will first be used to satisfy our obligations under that facility, as required by the agreement governing the revolving credit facility. Accordingly, until we achieve sufficient cash flows derived from the portfolio of life insurance policy benefits, we expect to rely on the proceeds from our ongoing offering of L Bonds to satisfy our ongoing financing and liquidity needs. Nevertheless, continued access to financing and liquidity under the revolving credit facility or otherwise is not guaranteed. For example, general economic conditions could limit our access to financing, as could regulatory or legal pressures exerted on us, our financiers, or those involved in our general plan of financing such as brokers, dealers, and registered investment advisors. If we are unable to borrow under the revolving credit facility or otherwise for any reason, or to renew or replace the revolving credit facility when it comes due in December 2016, our business would be adversely impacted and our ability to service and repay our obligations would be compromised.\nOur investments in life insurance policies have inherent risks, including fraud and legal challenges to the validity of the policies, which we will be unable to eliminate and which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWhen we purchase a life insurance policy, we underwrite the purchase of the policy to mitigate certain risks associated with insurance fraud and other legal challenges to the validity of the policy. For example, to the extent the insured is not aware of the existence of the policy, the insured does not exist, or the insurance company does not recognize the policy, the insurance company may cancel or rescind the policy thereby causing the loss of an investment in that policy. In addition, if an insured\u2019s medical records have been altered in such a way as to shorten a life expectancy as reported, this may cause us to overpay for the related policy. Finally, we may experience legal challenges from insurance companies claiming that the insured failed to have an insurable interest at the time the policy was originally purchased or that the policy owner made fraudulent disclosures to the insurer at the time the policy was purchased (e.g., disclosures pertaining to the health status of the insured or the existence or sources of premium financing), or challenges from the beneficiaries of an insurance policy claiming, upon mortality of the insured, that the sale of the policy to us was invalid.\nTo mitigate these risks, we require a current verification of coverage from the insurance company, complete a due-diligence investigation of the insured and accompanying medical records, review the life insurance policy application, require a policy to have been in force for at least two years before purchasing, and require a legal review of any premium financing associated with the life insurance policy to determine an appropriate insurable interest existed. Nevertheless, we do not expect that these steps will eliminate the risk of fraud or legal challenges to the life insurance policies we purchase. Furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or the interpretation of existing laws or regulations, may prove our due-diligence and risk-mitigation efforts inadequate if policies within our portfolio are successfully challenged. These changes or alterations in interpretation may inhibit our ability to purchase new policies with confidence. If a significant face amount of policies were invalidated for reasons of fraud or any other reason, our results of operations would be adversely affected, perhaps materially.\nEvery acquisition of a life insurance policy necessarily requires us to materially rely on information provided or obtained by third parties. Any misinformation or negligence in the course of obtaining information could materially and adversely affect the value of the policies we own.\nThe acquisition of each life insurance policy is negotiated based on variables and particular facts that are unique to the life insurance policy itself and the health of the insured. The facts we obtain about the policies and the insured at the time at which the policy is applied for and obtained are based on factual representations made to the insurance company by the insured, and the facts the insurance company independently obtains in the course of its own due-diligence examination, such as facts concerning the health of the insured and whether or not there is an insurable interest present when the policy was issued. Any misinformation or negligence in the course of obtaining information relating to an insurance policy or insured could materially and adversely impact the value of the life insurance policies we own and could, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and the value of any investment in our securities.\nOur business is subject to state regulation and changes in state laws and regulations governing our business, or changes in the interpretation of such laws and regulations, could negatively affect our business.\nWhen we purchase a life insurance policy, we are subject to state insurance regulations. Over the past years, we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of states that have adopted legislation and regulations from model laws promulgated by either the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) or by the National Conference of Insurance Legislators (NCOIL). These laws are essentially consumer protection statutes responding to abuses that arose early in the development of our industry, some of which may persist. Today, almost every state has adopted some version of either the NAIC or NCOIL model laws, which generally require the licensing of purchasers of and brokers for life insurance policies, the filing and approval of purchase agreements, and the disclosure of transaction fees. These laws also require various periodic reporting requirements and prohibit certain business practices deemed to be abusive.\nState statutes typically provide state regulatory agencies with significant powers to interpret, administer, and enforce the laws relating to the purchase of life insurance policies. Under statutory authority, state regulators have broad discretionary power and may impose new licensing requirements, interpret or enforce existing regulatory requirements in different ways or issue new administrative rules. State regulators may also impose rules that are generally adverse to our industry. Because the life insurance secondary market is relatively new and because of the history of certain abuses in the industry, we believe it is likely that state regulation will increase and grow more complex during the foreseeable future. We cannot, however, predict what any new regulation would specifically involve.\nAny adverse change in present laws or regulations, or their interpretation, in one or more states in which we operate (or an aggregation of states in which we conduct a significant amount of business) could result in our curtailment or termination of operations in such jurisdictions, or cause us to modify our operations in a way that adversely affects our profitability. Any such action could have a corresponding material and negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition, primarily through material decrease in revenues, and could also negatively affect our general business prospects.\nIf federal regulators or courts conclude that the purchase of life insurance in the secondary market constitutes, in all cases, a transaction in securities, we could be in violation of existing covenants under our revolving credit facility, which could result in significantly diminished access to capital. We could also face increased operational expenses. The materialization of any of these risks could adversely affect our operating results and possibly threaten the viability of our business.\nThe SEC has, on occasion, attempted to regulate the purchase of non-variable universal life insurance policies as transactions in securities under federal or state securities laws. In July 2010, the SEC issued a Staff Report of its Life Settlement Task Force. In that report, the Staff recommended that certain types of purchased insurance policies be classified as securities. The SEC has not taken any position on the Staff Report, and there is no indication if the SEC will take any action to implement the recommendations of the Staff Report. In addition, there have been several federal court cases in which transactions involving the purchase and fractionalization of life insurance contracts have been held to be transactions in securities under the federal Securities Act of 1933. We believe that the matters discussed in the Staff Report and existing case law, do not impact our current business model since our purchases of life settlements are distinguishable from those cases that have been held by courts, and advocated by the Staff Report, to be transactions in securities. For example, neither we nor any of our affiliates are involved in the fractionalization of life insurance policies, and we presently do not purchase variable life insurance policies.\nAs a practical matter, the widespread application of federal securities laws to our purchases of life insurance policies, either through the expansion of the definition of what constitutes a \u201csecurity,\u201d the expansion of the types of transactions in life insurance policies that would constitute transactions in \u201csecurities,\u201d or the elimination or limitation of available exemptions and exceptions (whether by statutory change, regulatory change, or administrative or court interpretation) could burden us and other companies operating in the life insurance secondary market through the imposition of additional processes in the purchase of life insurance policies or the imposition of additional corporate governance and operational requirements through the application of the federal Investment Company Act of 1940. Any such burdens could be material. In particular, we might be placed in a position where we might be in violation of existing covenants under our revolving credit facility requiring us not to operate or be characterized as an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which could in the short or long term affect our liquidity and increase our cost of capital and operational expenses, all of which would adversely affect our operating results. It is possible that such an outcome could threaten the viability of our business and our ability to satisfy our obligations as they come due.\nBeing a public company results in additional expenses and diverts management\u2019s attention, and could also adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified officers and directors.\nWe have been a public reporting company since January 31, 2012. As a public reporting company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These requirements generate significant accounting, legal, and financial compliance costs, and make some activities more difficult, time consuming or costly, and may place significant strain on our personnel and resources. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to establish the requisite disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, significant resources and management oversight are required.\nAs a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could have an adverse and even material effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These rules and regulations may also make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. If we are unable to obtain appropriate director and officer insurance, our ability to recruit and retain qualified officers and directors, especially those directors who may be deemed independent, could be adversely impacted.\nOur business and prospects may be adversely affected by changes, lack of growth, or increased competition in the life insurance secondary market.\nThe growth of the life insurance policy secondary market and our expansion within the market may be negatively affected by a variety of factors beyond our control, including:\n\u25cf the inability to locate sufficient numbers of life insurance policy sellers and agents to source life sellers;\n\u25cf the inability to convince life insurance policy owners of the benefits of selling their life insurance policy;\n\u25cf competition from other companies in the life insurance secondary market;\n\u25cf negative publicity about the life insurance secondary market based on actual or perceived abuses; and\n\u25cf the adoption of additional governmental regulation.\nThe relatively new and evolving nature of the market in which we operate makes these risks unique and difficult to quantify. Nevertheless, contractions in the secondary market for life insurance policies, whether resulting from general economic conditions, regulatory or legal pressures, or otherwise (including regulatory pressures exerted on us or others involved in the secondary market for life insurance or involved with participants in that market), could make participation in the market generally less desirable. This could, in turn, depress the prices at which life insurance policies on the secondary market are bought and sold. As indicated elsewhere in this report, decreases in the value of life insurance policies on the secondary market could negatively affect our results of operations and our financial condition since the value of our policy portfolio is marked to market on a quarterly basis.\nChanges in general economic conditions could adversely impact our business.\nChanges in general economic conditions, including, for example, interest rates, investor sentiment, changes specifically affecting the insurance industry, competition, technological developments, political and diplomatic events, tax laws, and other factors not known to us today, can substantially and adversely affect our business and prospects. For example, changes in interest rates may increase our cost of capital and ability to raise capital, and have a corresponding adverse impact on our operating results. While we may engage in certain hedging activities to mitigate the impact of these changes, none of these conditions are or will be within our control.\nIf actuarial assumptions we obtain from third-party providers and rely on to model our expected returns on our investments in life insurance policies change, our operating results and cash flow could be adversely affected, as well as the value of our collateral and our ability to service our debt obligations.\nThe expected internal rate of return we calculate we will earn when purchasing a life insurance policy is based upon a probability curve estimate of how long the insured will live-an actuarial life expectancy estimate. We presently obtain actuarial life expectancy estimates from third-party medical-actuarial underwriting companies. In the case of small face policies, which we currently define as life insurance policies with $1.0 million or less in face value of policy benefits, we may choose not to obtain life expectancies from third-party medical-actuarial firms, but rather use standard mortality tables to develop our own life expectancy of an insured. All actuarial life expectancies are subject to interpretation and change based on evolving medical technology, actuarial data, and analytical techniques. Any increase in the actuarial life expectancy estimates of insureds within our portfolio could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results and cash flow. Adverse impacts on the value of our life insurance policy portfolio or our cash flow could in turn impair the value of the collateral we have pledged to our creditors and our ability to service our debt and obligations as they come due.\nFor example, on January 22, 2013, 21st Services, an independent provider of life expectancy analysis and related services for the life settlement industry in general, announced advancements in its underwriting methodology, resulting in revised life expectancy mortality tables for life settlement transactions. These revised actuarial calculations had an adverse effect on the valuation of portfolio at December 31, 2012. It is possible that the life expectancies we presently use will again change in the future or that the life expectancy assumptions will fail substantially to meet actuarial estimates, and that any such failure could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nOn September 15, 2014, 21st Services announced further changes to its mortality tables primarily for insureds age 90 and older, as well as updated adjustment factors designed to better underwrite seniors with multiple impairments. Although these changes represent small portions of 21st Services\u2019 historical underwritings and were not material to the Company\u2019s portfolio of life insurance policies, we expect medical-actuarial underwriting firms to continue improving and refining their underwriting methodology. As a result, we will continue to monitor developments in medical-actuarial methodologies. We generally expect to incorporate such changes to our portfolio when we update our life expectancy reports.\nIn addition to actuarial life expectancies, we rely on pricing and premium forecasting software models developed by third-party actuarial companies for the valuation of policies we purchase, future mortality revenues, and the calculation of anticipated internal rates of return. These pricing models forecast the estimated future premiums due as well the future mortalities based on the survival probabilities of the insureds over their life expectancies. It is possible that the actuarial tables we presently use will again change the future or that the mortality assumptions will fail substantially to meet actuarial estimates, and that any such failure could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on estimated rates of mortality for the actuarial assumptions we use when valuing life insurance policies and forecasting the performance of our portfolio, and we also rely on other estimates derived from statistical methodologies for projecting our future cash flows, among other things. If our estimates prove to be incorrect, it could materially and adversely affect our ability to satisfy our debt service and repayment obligations.\nIf we assume we will receive cash inflows from policies sooner than we actually do, we may not be able to make payment on our debt obligations in a timely manner, or at all. Moreover, a significant medical discovery or advance that results in mortality improvements among seniors, above historically predicted actuarial rates could have a material adverse effect on our life insurance policy investments.\nFor example, we use a modeling method for projecting cash flows known as the \u201cprobabilistic method.\u201d This is an actuarial method that uses a mortality curve to project the likely flow of policy benefits to us, and attempts to reflect the probability that each premium must be paid. Since we have owned our current insurance policy portfolio we have in fact experienced fewer cash flows from policy benefits than projected in the early stages of ownership of our current life insurance policy portfolio using this method. We had expected to receive approximately $108.7 million cumulative policy benefits as of December 31, 2014, and in fact received $46.6 million. This has resulted in greater than expected premium payments, increasing such expected payments from an expected $79.7 million to $84.2 million. Barring significant mortality improvements (i.e., medical discoveries or advancements relating to the medical conditions of insureds), however, the fact that actual results have differed from the expectations derived from the probabilistic method of projecting cash flows should ordinarily result in greater cash flows later in the portfolio\u2019s servicing period.\nWe update and revise our projected future cash flows each month using the probabilistic method to reflect the actual experience within our life insurance policy portfolio to date. We use the current future cash flow projection to generate our expected internal rate of return on the life insurance policy portfolio we own. We would expect to change our method of calculating our future cash flows only if leading actuarial firms determined that such a methodology was no longer the most appropriate means of projecting cash flows from a life insurance policy portfolio. Any change to the pricing model, methodology, premium forecasting assumptions, cash flow projections, or the mortality assumptions accompanied therewith that increase the projected cost of insurance premiums or decrease the probability of mortality could have a material and adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows. Ultimately, this could adversely affect our ability to meet our debt service and repayment obligations and our viability.\nRisks Unique to Our Company\nWe may not be able to raise the capital that we are seeking, and may be unable to meet our overall business objectives of growing a larger, more statistically diverse portfolio of life insurance policies without the proceeds from our continuous offering of L Bonds.\nOur offering of L Bonds has been the principal means by which we have raised the funds needed to meet our goal of growing a larger and more statistically diverse portfolio that is more likely to meet our cash flow projections. While we plan to continue financing our business, if we are unable to continue to do so for any reason we may be unable to meet our goal. In addition, if holders of our Series I Secured Notes or L Bonds were to fail to renew those securities with the frequency we have historically experienced, and actual cash flows from our portfolio of life insurance policies do not occur as our actuarial projections have forecasted, we could be forced to sell our investments in life insurance policies in order to service or satisfy our debt-related obligations. If we are forced to sell investments in life insurance policies or our entire portfolio, we may be unable to sell them at prices we believe are appropriate, and may not be able to sell them at prices that approximate the discount rate we have applied to value our portfolio, particularly if our sale of policies occurs at a time when we are (or are perceived to be) in distress. In any such event, our business and the value of our securities, including our debt securities and common stock, may be materially and adversely impacted.\nWe depend upon cash distributions from our subsidiaries, and contractual restrictions on distributions to us or adverse events at one of our operating subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect our ability to pay our debts and to continue to operate our business.\nGWG Holdings, Inc. is a holding company. As a holding company, we conduct our operations through our operating subsidiaries, and our only significant assets are the capital stock of our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our ability to meet our cash obligations, including our obligations under the L Bonds, depends in material part upon the ability of our subsidiaries to make cash distributions to us. In this regard, the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us is, and will continue to be, restricted by certain negative covenants in the agreement governing our revolving credit facility. DLP Funding II is the borrower under our revolving credit facility (see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements). The significant majority of the insurance policies we own are subject to a collateral arrangement with the agent for our revolving credit lender, as described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. Under this arrangement, collection and escrow accounts are used to fund purchases of and premiums for our insurance policies and to pay interest and other charges under the revolving credit facility. The lender and its agent must authorize all disbursements from these accounts, including any distributions to GWG Life. Distributions are limited to an amount that would result in the borrowers (us) realizing an annualized rate of return on the equity funded amount for such assets of not more than 18%, as determined by the agent. After such amount is reached, the credit agreement requires that excess funds be used to fund repayments or a reserve account in a certain amount, before any additional distributions may be made.\nIf any of the above limitations were to materially impede the flow of cash to us, such fact would materially and adversely affect our ability to service and repay our debt, including obligations under the L Bonds and Series I Secured Notes. In addition, any adverse event at the subsidiary level, such as a declaration of bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization or an event of default under our revolving credit facility, could materially and adversely affect the ability of our subsidiaries to make cash distributions to us. Just as with a material contractual impediment to cash flow, any such subsidiary corporate event would materially and adversely affect our ability to service and repay our debt, including obligations under the L Bonds, and negatively impact our ability to continue operations.\nIf a significant number of holders of our Series I Secured Notes and L Bonds demand repayment of those instruments instead of renewing them, and at such time we do not have sufficient capital on hand to fund such repayment (and do not otherwise have access to sufficient capital), we may be forced to liquidate some of our life insurance assets, which could have a material and adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2014 we had approximately $186.4 million of L Bonds outstanding. In addition, our direct and wholly owned subsidiary, GWG Life, had issued and outstanding approximately $28.0 million in Series I Secured Notes as of December 31, 2014. By virtue of GWG Life\u2019s full and unconditional guarantee of obligations under the L Bonds, and other agreements contained in or made in connection with the indenture, the L Bonds are pari passu in right of payment and collateral with the Series I Secured Notes. The indenture governing the L Bonds, and the note issuance and security agreement governing the Series I Secured Notes, each provide for cross defaults upon an event of default under the provisions of the other agreement (i.e., an event of default under the note issuance and security agreement will constitute an event of default under the indenture for the L Bonds, and vice-versa).\nThe terms of the Series I Secured Notes have renewal features. Since we first issued our Series I Secured Notes, we have experienced $133.7 million in maturities, of which $104.0 million has renewed for an additional term as of December 31, 2014. This has provided us with an aggregate renewal rate of approximately 78% for investments in our Series I Secured Notes. The terms of the L Bonds also have renewal features. Since we first issued our L Bonds, we have experienced $62.3 million in maturities, of which $41.4 million has renewed for an additional term as of December 31, 2014. This has provided us with an aggregate renewal rate of approximately 66% for investments in the currently outstanding L Bonds. Future contractual maturities of Series I Secured Notes and L Bonds at December 31, 2014 are as follows:\nIf investors holding existing indebtedness with short-term maturities do not elect to renew and we do not, at such time, have access to sufficient capital or have not raised sufficient capital by other financing efforts, we may need to liquidate some of our investments in life insurance policies earlier than anticipated. In such an event, we may be unable to sell those life insurance policies at prices we believe are fair or otherwise appropriate and such sales could have a material and adverse impact on our results of operations.\nBecause we intend to hold our life insurance policies to their maturity, we therefore measure our debt coverage ratio against our current cost of financing, which may not reflect the sale price of our life insurance policies if we were to liquidate them.\nWe intend to hold our life insurance policy investments until they are paid out at the mortality of the insured. As a result, we measure our debt coverage ratio based on the portfolio\u2019s gross expected yield against the interest cost of our total debt obligations to finance the portfolio. The debt coverage ratio, expressed as a percentage, is defined as the ratio of (i) total amounts outstanding on any indebtedness for borrowed money, over (ii) the net present asset value of all life insurance assets we own, plus any cash held in our accounts. For this purpose, the net present asset value of our life insurance assets is calculated as the present value of the life insurance portfolio\u2019s expected future cash flows discounted at the weighted-average interest rate of the indebtedness for the previous month. Under the indenture, the maximum amount of such securities we may issue at any time is limited to an amount such that our debt coverage ratio does not exceed 90%. This limitation is designed to provide some comfort to holders of our debt that the value of our assets exceeds our obligations to those holders. Nevertheless, the debt coverage ratio (as calculated) is not based on the fair value of our life insurance assets, which may be different - greater or less-than the amount we would receive if we were forced to sell those assets in the marketplace. Furthermore, mere compliance with the debt coverage ratio does not contemplate or account for the significant transactional costs that could be associated with a sale of all or any significant portion of our portfolio.\nOur controlling stockholders and principal executives are involved in litigation \u201cclawback\u201d claims, and it is possible that the trustee may assert claims against our company or that other adverse outcomes could negatively affect the Company.\nOur Chief Executive Officer, Jon R. Sabes, and our corporate secretary and Executive Vice President of Originations and Servicing, Steven F. Sabes, who together beneficially own or control approximately 74.8% of our common stock, are subject to litigation relating to claims by a bankruptcy trustee for loan payments made to an affiliate, Opportunity Finance, LLC. The litigation stems from the 2010 conviction of an individual operating a fraudulent business, which business filed for bankruptcy in 2008. The bankruptcy trustee alleges that loan repayments to Opportunity Finance were avoidable transfers under preference or other legal theories and seeks to recover amounts for other creditors of the bankruptcy estate. Case No. 08-45257 (U.S. Bankruptcy Court District of Minnesota). Such payments may ultimately be deemed to be avoidable transfers under preference or other legal theories. In addition, GWG Holdings invested $1.0 million in Opportunity Finance, LLC in 2006 and was repaid and received $176,948 of interest income from that investment in 2007. To date no claim has been made against the Company.\nWhile we believe there are numerous meritorious defenses to the claims made by the bankruptcy trustee and others, and we are advised that the defendants in that action will vigorously defend against the trustee\u2019s claims, such defendants may not prevail in the litigation. If the bankruptcy trustee or a successful private plaintiff sought to sell or transfer the equity interests of Jon R. Sabes or Steven F. Sabes as a result of the litigation, there could be a change in control of the Company, and our business together with all of our investors, including investors in our debentures, could be materially and adversely impacted. Such adverse results would likely arise in connection with negative change-in-control covenants contained in our revolving credit facility agreements, the breach of those covenants and an ensuing event of default under such facility. In addition, if the bankruptcy trustee or a private plaintiff sought to sell or transfer the equity interests of Jon R. Sabes or Steven F. Sabes as a result of the litigation, such transfers would adversely affect holders of our previously issued L Bonds by reducing the number of shares of common stock of GWG Holdings that have been pledged as collateral security for our obligations under the debentures. Finally, regardless of the outcome of this litigation, these matters may distract management and reduce the time and attention that they are able to devote to our business.\nThe loss of the services of our current executives or other key employees, or the failure to attract additional key individuals, would materially adversely affect our business operations and prospects.\nOur financial success is dependent to a significant degree upon the efforts of our current executive officers and other key employees. In addition, our revolving credit facility requires Messrs. Jon R. Sabes and Steven F. Sabes to generally remain active within the business. We have entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Jon R. Sabes, Steven F. Sabes, Paul A. Siegert, William B. Acheson, Michael D. Freedman and Jon L. Gangelhoff. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that these individuals will continue to provide services to us. A voluntary or involuntary termination of employment could have a materially adverse effect on our business operations if we were not able to attract qualified replacements in a timely manner. At present, we do not maintain key-man life insurance policies for any of these individuals. In addition, our success and viability is also dependent to a significant extent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in all areas of our business, especially our sales, policy acquisition, and financial management team. If we were to lose the members of these service teams, we would need to replace them with qualified individuals in a timely manner or our business operations and prospects could be adversely impacted.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and our election to delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies may result in our financial statements not being comparable to those of some other public companies. As a result of this and other reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our securities may be less attractive to investors.\nAs a public reporting company with less than $1.0 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of certain reduced reporting requirements and is relieved of certain other significant requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. In particular, as an emerging growth company we:\n\u25cf are not required to obtain an attestation and report from our auditors on our management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u25cf are not required to provide a detailed narrative disclosure discussing our compensation principles, objectives and elements and analyzing how those elements fit with our principles and objectives (commonly referred to as \u201ccompensation discussion and analysis\u201d);\n\u25cf are not required to obtain a non-binding advisory vote from our stockholders on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements (commonly referred to as the \u201csay-on-pay,\u201d \u201csay-on-frequency\u201d and \u201csay-on-golden-parachute\u201d votes);\n\u25cf are exempt from certain executive compensation disclosure provisions requiring a pay-for-performance graph and CEO pay ratio disclosure;\n\u25cf may present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management\u2019s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A; and\n\u25cf are eligible to claim longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under \u00a7107 of the JOBS Act.\nWe intend to take advantage of all of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under \u00a7107 of the JOBS Act. Our election to use the phase-in periods may make it difficult to compare our financial statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging growth companies that have opted out of the phase-in periods under \u00a7107 of the JOBS Act.\nCertain of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions were already available to us due to the fact that we also qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under SEC rules. For instance, smaller reporting companies are not required to obtain an auditor attestation and report regarding management\u2019s assessment of internal control over financial reporting; are not required to provide a compensation discussion and analysis; are not required to provide a pay-for-performance graph or CEO pay ratio disclosure; and may present only two years of audited financial statements and related MD&A disclosure.\nUnder the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of the above-described reduced reporting requirements and exemptions for up to five years after our initial sale of common equity pursuant to a registration statement declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, or such earlier time that we no longer meet the definition of an emerging growth company. In this regard, the JOBS Act provides that we would cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d if we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenues, have more than $700 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion in principal amount of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. Furthermore, under current SEC rules we will continue to qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d for so long as we have a public float (i.e., the market value of common equity held by non-affiliates) of less than $75 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our securities less attractive due to our reliance on these exemptions. If investors were to find our securities less attractive as a result of our election, we may have difficulty raising all of the proceeds we seek in our continuous offering of the L Bonds. In addition, the market price of our common stock may suffer.", "PERMNO": 14930, "SIC": 6799, "TIC": "GWGH"}
