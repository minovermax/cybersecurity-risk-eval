{"cik": "742112", "company": "INVACARE CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe company\u2019s business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties. One should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the company\u2019s other filings with the SEC, before making any investment decision with respect to the company\u2019s securities. The risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones the company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known by the company or that the company currently deems immaterial may also affect the company\u2019s business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties occur, develop or worsen, the company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could change substantially.\nThe company is subject to a consent decree of injunction (\"consent decree\") with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d), the effects of which have been, and continue to be, costly to the company and could result in continued adverse consequences to the company's business.\nIn December 2012, the company became subject to a consent decree of injunction filed by FDA with respect to the company's Corporate facility and its Taylor Street manufacturing facility in Elyria, Ohio. The consent decree initially limited the company's (i) manufacture and distribution of power and manual wheelchairs, wheelchair components and wheelchair sub-assemblies at or from its Taylor Street manufacturing facility, except in verified cases of medical necessity, (ii) design activities related to wheelchairs and power beds that take place at the impacted Elyria facilities and (iii) replacement, service and repair of products already in use from the Taylor Street manufacturing facility. Under the terms of the consent decree, in order to resume full operations, the company had to successfully complete independent, third-party expert certification audits at the impacted Elyria facilities, comprised of three distinct certification reports separately submitted to, and accepted by, FDA; submit its own report to the FDA; and successfully complete a reinspection by FDA of the company\u2019s Corporate and Taylor Street facilities.\nOn July 24, 2017, following its reinspection, FDA notified the company that it was in substantial compliance with the QSR and, at that time, the company was permitted to resume full operations at those facilities including the resumption of unrestricted sales of products made in those facilities.\nThe consent decree will continue in effect for a minimum of five years from July 24, 2017, during which time the company's Corporate and Taylor Street facilities must complete two semi-annual and then four annual audits\nperformed by a company retained expert firm. The expert audit firm will determine whether the facilities remain in continuous compliance with the FDA Act, regulations and the terms of the consent decree. The FDA has the authority to inspect these facilities and any other FDA registered facility, at any time. The FDA also has the authority to order the company to take a wide variety of remedial actions if the FDA finds that the company is not in compliance with the consent decree or FDA regulations. The FDA also has authority under the consent decree to assess liquidated damages for any violations of the consent decree, FDA regulations or the FDA Act. Any such failure by the company to comply with the consent decree or FDA regulations, or any need to complete significant remediation as a result of any such audits or inspections, or actions taken by the FDA as a result of any such failure to comply, could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nThe limitations previously imposed by the FDA consent decree negatively affected net sales in the NA/HME segment and, to a certain extent, the Asia/Pacific segment beginning in 2012. The limitations led to delays in new product introductions. Further, uncertainty regarding how long the limitations would be in effect limited the company\u2019s ability to renegotiate and bid on certain customer contracts and otherwise led to a decline in customer orders.\nAlthough the company has been permitted to resume full operations at the Corporate and Taylor Street facilities, the negative effect of the consent decree on customer orders and net sales in the NA/HME and Asia/Pacific segments has been considerable, and it is uncertain as to whether, or how quickly, the company will be able to rebuild net sales to more typical historical levels, irrespective of market conditions. Accordingly, when compared to the company's 2010 results, the previous limitations in the consent decree had, and likely may continue to have, a material adverse effect on the company's business, financial condition and results of operations. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe company\u2019s failure to comply with medical device regulatory requirements or receive regulatory clearance or approval for the company\u2019s products or operations in the United States or abroad could adversely affect the company\u2019s business.\nThe company\u2019s medical devices are subject to extensive regulation in the United States by FDA, and by similar governmental authorities in the foreign countries where the company does business. FDA regulates virtually all aspects of a medical device\u2019s development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, promotion, distribution and marketing. In addition, the company is required to file reports with FDA if the company\u2019s products may have caused, or contributed to, a death or serious injury, or if they malfunction and would be\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nlikely to cause, or contribute to, a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. In general, unless an exemption applies, the company\u2019s mobility and respiratory therapy products must receive a pre-market clearance from FDA before they can be marketed in the United States. FDA also regulates the export of medical devices to foreign countries. The company cannot be assured that any of the company\u2019s devices, to the extent required, will be cleared by FDA through the pre-market clearance process or that FDA will provide export certificates that are necessary to export certain of the company\u2019s products. Export certificates are required for the company to have its products registered for sale in certain foreign countries. In connection with the FDA warning letter received by the company's Sanford, Florida facility in December 2010, as described below, FDA has refused to provide new export certificates for company products until the matters covered in the warning letter are resolved. Currently, the company cannot obtain new certificates of export for Sanford, Florida facility products until the warning letter has been closed. The inability to obtain export certificates for products produced at its Sanford facility has limited the company's ability to support new foreign markets with such products.\nAdditionally, the company is required to obtain pre-market clearances to market modifications to the company\u2019s existing products or market its existing products for new indications. FDA requires device manufacturers themselves to make and document a determination as to whether or not a modification requires a new clearance; however, FDA can review and disagree with a manufacturer\u2019s decision. The company has applied for, and received, a number of pre-market clearances for modifications to marketed devices. The company may not be successful in receiving clearances in the future or FDA may not agree with the company\u2019s decisions not to seek clearances for any particular device modification. FDA may require a clearance for any past or future modification or a new indication for the company\u2019s existing products. Such submissions may require the submission of additional data and may be time consuming and costly, and ultimately, may not be cleared by FDA.\nIf FDA requires the company to obtain pre-market clearances for any modification to a previously cleared device, the company may be required to cease manufacturing and marketing the modified device or to recall the modified device until the company obtains FDA clearance, and the company may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. In addition, FDA may not clear these submissions in a timely manner, if at all. FDA also may change its policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, each of which could prevent or delay pre-market clearance of the company\u2019s devices, or could impact the company\u2019s ability to market a device that was previously cleared. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect the company\u2019s business.\nThe company\u2019s failure to comply with the regulatory requirements of FDA and other applicable U.S. regulatory requirements may subject the company to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions. These sanctions include warning letters, civil penalties, criminal penalties, injunctions, consent decrees, product seizure or detention, product recalls and total or partial suspension of production.\nAs part of its regulatory function, FDA routinely inspects the facilities of medical device companies and has continued to actively inspect the company\u2019s facilities, other than through the processes established under the consent decree. Recent inspections for which follow-up remains ongoing are summarized in Item 1. Business-Government Regulation-FDA-Other FDA Matters. The FDA has informed the company of further upcoming inspections to its facilities, and the company believes that additional inspections beyond those for which it has been notified will likely occur in the near future. Accordingly, the company expects that the FDA will from time to time, inspect substantially all the company's domestic and foreign FDA-registered operational facilities and may do so repeatedly. The results of regulatory claims, proceedings or investigations are difficult to predict. An unfavorable resolution or outcome of any matter that may arise out of any FDA inspection of the company's facilities, could materially and adversely affect the company's business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nIn many of the foreign countries in which the company manufactures or markets its products, the company is subject to extensive medical device regulations that are similar to those of FDA, including those in Europe. The regulation of the company\u2019s products in Europe falls primarily within the European Economic Area, which consists of the European Union member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Only medical devices that comply with certain conformity requirements of the Medical Device Directive are allowed to be marketed within the European Economic Area. In addition, the national health or social security organizations of certain foreign countries, including those outside Europe, require the company\u2019s products to be qualified before they can be marketed in those countries. Failure to receive, or delays in the receipt of, relevant foreign qualifications in the European Economic Area or other foreign countries could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business.\nBeing in the health care industry, the company is subject to extensive government regulation, and if the company fails to comply with applicable health care laws or regulations, the company could suffer severe civil or criminal sanctions or may be required to make significant changes to the company\u2019s operations that could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s results of operations.\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThe company sells its products principally to medical equipment and home health care providers who resell or rent those products to consumers. Many of those providers (the company\u2019s customers) are reimbursed by third-party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, for the company products sold to their customers and patients. The U.S. federal government and the governments in the states and other countries in which the company operates regulate many aspects of the company\u2019s business and the business of the company's customers. As a part of the health care industry, the company and its customers are subject to extensive government regulation, including numerous laws directed at preventing fraud and abuse and laws regulating reimbursement under various government programs. The marketing, invoicing, documenting and other practices of health care suppliers and manufacturers are all subject to government scrutiny. Government agencies periodically open investigations and obtain information from health care suppliers and manufacturers pursuant to the legal process. Violations of law or regulations can result in severe administrative, civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, including disqualification from Medicare and other reimbursement programs, which could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business. While the company has established numerous policies and procedures to address compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts will be effective to prevent a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business from noncompliance issues. For example, as discussed in the preceding Risk Factors, the company is subject to a FDA consent decree affecting its Corporate facility and Taylor Street manufacturing facility in Elyria, Ohio and subject to FDA warning letters related to its Sanford, Florida and Albstadt, Germany facilities.\nHealth care is an area of rapid regulatory change. Changes in the law and new interpretations of existing laws may affect permissible activities, the costs associated with doing business, and reimbursement amounts paid by federal, state and other third-party payors, all of which may affect the company and its customers. The company cannot predict the future of federal, state and local regulation or legislation, including Medicare and Medicaid statutes and regulations, or possible changes in health care policies in any country in which the company conducts business. Future legislation and regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business.\nThe company\u2019s products are subject to recalls, which could be costly and harm the company\u2019s reputation and business.\nThe company is subject to ongoing medical device reporting regulations that require the company to report to FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries if the company\u2019s products cause, or contribute to, death or serious injury, or if they malfunction and would be likely to\ncause, or contribute to, death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. In light of a deficiency, defect in design or manufacturing or defect in labeling, the company may voluntarily elect to recall or correct the company\u2019s products. In addition, FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries could force the company to do a field correction or recall the company\u2019s products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacturing. A government mandated or voluntary recall or field correction by the company could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors or design defects, including defects in labeling. Any recall or field correction could divert managerial and financial resources and could harm the company\u2019s reputation with its customers, product users and the health care professionals that use, prescribe and recommend the company\u2019s products. The company could have product recalls or field actions that result in significant costs to the company in the future, and these actions could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business. The company will continue to review the adequacy of its recall accruals as the recalls progress, as its warranty reserves are subject to adjustment in future periods as new developments can impact the company's estimate of the cost of these matters.\nChanges in government and other third-party payor reimbursement levels and practices have negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact the company\u2019s revenues and profitability.\nThe company\u2019s products are sold primarily through a network of medical equipment and home health care providers, extended care facilities and other providers such as various government-provider agencies throughout the world. Many of these providers (the company\u2019s customers) are reimbursed for the products and services provided to their customers and patients by third-party payors, such as government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care programs. Most of these programs set maximum reimbursement levels for some of the products sold by the company in the United States and abroad. If third-party payors deny coverage, make the reimbursement process or documentation requirements more uncertain or further reduce their current levels of reimbursement (i.e., beyond the reductions described below), or if the company\u2019s costs of production do not decrease to keep pace with decreases in reimbursement levels, the company may be unable to sell the affected product(s) through its distribution channels on a profitable basis.\nReduced government reimbursement levels and changes in reimbursement policies have in the past added, and could continue to add, significant pressure to the company\u2019s revenues and profitability. For example, in 100 metropolitan areas, the CMS introduced its NCB program which set new, lower payment rates for medical equipment and supplies. Round 1 of NCB for nine metropolitan areas in\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nthe U.S. went into effect in January 2011. The reimbursement rates for nine product categories were reduced by an average of 32 percent in these nine metropolitan areas. Effective July 2013, CMS commenced round 2 of the NCB program, which was expanded to include an additional 91 metropolitan areas. In January 2016, CMS began the deployment of NCB rates to the remainder of the Medicare population that had not yet been impacted by the program, primarily to rural areas. CMS has divided the United States into eight regions and applied the average reimbursement reduction per NCB product category in each region from Round 1 and Round 2 to the rural providers in those eight regions. Fifty percent of the reimbursement reduction became effective in January 2016. The remaining half of the reduction was applied in July 2016, although in December 2016 Congress retroactively delayed that payment cut until January 1, 2017.\nCMS announced that the NCB program has resulted in $202.1 million in savings in its first year of implementation in the nine metropolitan areas with significant savings primarily in oxygen and oxygen supplies, mail-order diabetic supplies and standard power wheelchairs. The CMS Office of the Actuary estimated that the NCB program would save Medicare an estimated $25.8 billion, and beneficiaries an estimated $17.2 billion, over ten years.\nSimilar trends and concerns are occurring in state Medicaid programs. These recent changes to reimbursement policies, and any additional unfavorable reimbursement policies or budgetary cuts that may be adopted in the future, could adversely affect the demand for the company\u2019s products by customers who depend on reimbursement from the government-funded programs. The percentage of the company\u2019s overall sales that are dependent on Medicare or other insurance programs may increase as the portion of the U.S. population over age 65 continues to grow, making the company more vulnerable to reimbursement level reductions by these organizations. Reduced government reimbursement levels also could result in reduced private payor reimbursement levels because some third-party payors index their reimbursement schedules to Medicare fee schedules. Reductions in reimbursement levels also may affect the profitability of the company\u2019s customers and ultimately force some customers without strong financial resources to become unable to pay their bills as they come due or go out of business. The reimbursement reductions may prove to be so dramatic that some of the company\u2019s customers may not be able to adapt quickly enough to survive. The company is one of the industry\u2019s largest creditors and an increase in bankruptcies or financial weakness in the company\u2019s customer base could have an adverse effect on the company\u2019s financial results.\nOutside the U.S., reimbursement systems vary significantly by country. Many foreign markets have government-managed health care systems that govern reimbursement for home health care products. The ability of hospitals and other providers supported by such systems to\npurchase the company\u2019s products is dependent, in part, upon public budgetary constraints. Various countries have tightened reimbursement rates and other countries may follow. If adequate levels of reimbursement from third-party payors outside of the U.S. are not obtained, international sales of the company\u2019s products may decline, which could adversely affect the company\u2019s net sales.\nThe impact of all the above is uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nThe adoption of healthcare reform and other legislative developments in the U.S. may adversely affect the company\u2019s business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nThe U.S. Affordable Care Act enacted in 2010 includes provisions intended to expand access to health insurance coverage, improve the quality and reduce the costs of healthcare over time. Specifically, as one means to pay for the costs of the Affordable Care Act, the law imposes a 2.3% sales-based excise tax on U.S. sales by manufacturers or importers of most medical devices. The excise tax is deductible by the manufacturer or importer on its federal income tax return. The company has determined that most of its products are exempt from the tax based on the retail exemption provided in the Affordable Care Act as defined by the regulations. However, certain products that it sells for institutional use are subject to the excise tax. Based on the company's interpretation of the regulations, the impact from the tax has been immaterial for the company. However, the excise tax may increase the company\u2019s cost of doing business, particularly if the exemptions do not ultimately apply as the company expects based on its interpretations of the regulations. In January 2018, Congress passed a moratorium to suspend the excise tax until January 2020.\nThe Affordable Care Act and the programs implemented by the law may reduce reimbursements for the company's products, may impact the demand for the company\u2019s products and may impact the prices at which the company sells its products. In addition, various healthcare programs and regulations may be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nIf the company\u2019s business transformation efforts are ineffective, the company\u2019s strategic goals, business plans, financial performance or liquidity could be negatively impacted.\nThe company is in the midst of a multi-year turnaround strategy intended to substantially transform its business and re-orient its resources to a more clinically complex mix of products and solutions. To date, this strategy has included\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nactions to re-orient the company\u2019s North American commercial team, restart the company\u2019s innovation pipeline, shift its product mix, develop and expand its talent, and strengthen its balance sheet. As part of these actions, the company has increased the size of its salesforce and support in North America, invested in product development, discontinued a significant amount of non-core product, and issued convertible debt. The strategy also will include steps to realign infrastructure and processes, such as restructuring actions, intended to drive efficiency and reduce costs.\nThe company may not be successful in achieving the full long-term growth and profitability, operating efficiencies and cost reductions, or other benefits expected from these efforts. The company also may experience business disruptions associated with these activities. Further, the benefits of the strategy, if realized, may be realized later than expected, the costs of implementing the strategy may be greater than anticipated, and the company may lack adequate cash or capital or may not be able to attract and retain the necessary talent, to complete the transformation. If these measures are not successful, the company may undertake additional transformation efforts, which could result in future expenses. If the company\u2019s business transformation efforts prove ineffective, the company\u2019s ability to achieve its strategic goals and business plans, and the company\u2019s financial performance, may be materially adversely affected.\nIf the company\u2019s business transformation efforts prove ineffective and it continues to experience negative cash flows and losses, the company may require additional financing. Under these circumstances, such financing may be difficult or expensive to obtain, and the company can make no assurances that it would be available on terms acceptable to the company, if at all.\nThe company\u2019s revenues and profits are subject to exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations that could adversely affect its results of operations or financial position.\nCurrency exchange rates are subject to fluctuation due to, among other things, changes in local, regional or global economic conditions, the imposition of currency exchange restrictions and unexpected changes in regulatory or taxation environments. The predominant currency used by the company\u2019s subsidiaries outside the U.S. to transact business is the functional currency used for each subsidiary. Through the company\u2019s international operations, the company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in exchange rates can have a significant impact on net sales and elements of cost. The company conducts a significant number of transactions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, because certain of the company\u2019s costs and revenues are denominated in other currencies, in particular costs and revenues from its European operations, the company\u2019s results of operations are exposed to foreign exchange rate\nfluctuations as the financial results of those operations are translated from local currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. For example, during 2017, the devaluation of the Euro had a negative impact on the translation of company's European segment net income into U.S. dollars, and the foreign currency impact of the Brexit referendum in the U.K. had a negative impact on acquisition of dollar and Euro denominated goods in the U.K. If other countries also exit the European Union, similar negative impacts may result.\nThe company uses foreign exchange forward contracts primarily to help reduce its exposure to transactional exchange rate risk. Despite the company\u2019s efforts to mitigate these risks, however, the company\u2019s revenues and profitability may be materially adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations. The company does not have any similar arrangements that mitigate the company's exposure to foreign exchange translation risk, and does not believe that any meaningful arrangement to do so is available to the company.\nThe company also is exposed to market risk through various financial instruments, including fixed rate and floating rate debt instruments. The company does at times use interest rate swap contracts to mitigate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations, but those efforts may not adequately protect the company from significant interest rate risks. Interest on some of the company\u2019s debt is based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), which is currently historically low. Increases in LIBOR could have a significant impact on the company\u2019s reported interest expense, to the extent that the company has outstanding borrowings subject to LIBOR-based interest rates.\nIf the company's information technology systems fail, or if the company experiences an interruption in the operation of its information technology systems, then the company's business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe company relies upon the capacity, reliability and security of its information technology, or IT, systems across all of its major business functions, including research and development, manufacturing, sales, financial and administrative functions. Since the company is geographically diverse, has various business segments and has grown over the years through various acquisitions, it also has many disparate versions of IT systems across its organization. As a result of these disparate IT systems, some of which may no longer be supported by the hardware or software vendors, the company faces the challenge of supporting these older systems, implementing upgrades or migrating to new platforms when necessary and aggregating data that is timely and accurate. The failure of the company's information technology systems, whether resulting from the disparate or older versions of IT systems across its various segments, business functions or otherwise, its inability to\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nsuccessfully maintain, enhance and/or replace its information technology systems, or any compromise of the integrity or security of the data that is generated from information technology systems, or any shortcomings in the company's disaster recovery platforms, could adversely affect the company's results of operations, disrupt business and make the company unable, or severely limit the company's ability to respond to customer demands. In addition, the company's information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from: earthquake, fire, flood and other natural disasters; employee or other theft; cybersecurity attacks by computer viruses, malware or hackers; power outages; and computer systems, internet, telecommunications or data network failure.\nAny interruption of the company's information technology systems could result in decreased revenue, increased expenses, increased capital expenditures, customer dissatisfaction and potential lawsuits, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.\nIncreased IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to the company\u2019s systems, networks, products and services.\nIncreased global IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of the company\u2019s systems and networks as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the company\u2019s data, including potential general data protection regulation and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act risks. While the company attempts to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, monitoring of its networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, the company\u2019s systems, networks, products and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats. Through its sales channels, the company may collect and store confidential information that customers provide to, among other things, purchase products or services, enroll in promotional programs and register on the company\u2019s website. The company may also acquire and retain information about suppliers and employees in the normal course of business. The company also creates and maintains proprietary information that is critical to its business, such as its product designs and manufacturing processes.\nDespite the company\u2019s efforts to secure its systems and networks, the company could experience a significant data security breach. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate the company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 information systems and, if successful, misappropriate confidential customer, supplier, employee or other business information, such as company intellectual property. Third parties could also gain control of company systems and use them for criminal purposes. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could result\nin the loss of existing customers, difficulty in attracting new customers, exposure to claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card associations, employees and other persons, imposition of regulatory sanctions or penalties, in additional expenses or lost revenues, or in other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe company is dependent upon its processes and procedures to ensure essential operational functions can continue during events that disrupt normal operations.\nA major natural or manmade disaster such as terrorist attack, fire, hurricane, tornado, earthquake, or flood could cause damage to the company or key supplier facilities, limiting the company\u2019s ability to sustain operations. The damage could result in an inability to meet customer demands resulting in the loss of associated sales and profits, and in property losses in excess of insurance coverage. While the company has put in place procedures to ensure essential functions continue in the event of a crisis, there is no guarantee that its procedures will be adequate or sufficient to handle a given unforeseen event.\nThe industry in which the company operates is highly competitive and some of the company\u2019s competitors may have greater financial resources, a more effective market strategy or better strategic execution.\nThe home medical equipment market is highly competitive and the company\u2019s products face significant competition from other well-established manufacturers or potential new market entrants. Reduced government reimbursement levels and changes in reimbursement policies, such as the National Competitive Bidding program implemented by CMS, may drive competitors, particularly those that have greater financial resources than the company's to offer drastically reduced pricing terms in an effort to take market share from the company or secure government acceptance of their products and pricing. new or disruptive products which compete with the company's products may be introduced in the market or may find higher level or customer acceptance than the company's products. Any increase in competition may cause the company to lose market share or compel the company to reduce prices to remain competitive, which could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s results of operations. The company's failure to recognize changing market demands or a failure to develop or execute a strategy to meet such changes could also result in a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe consolidation of health care customers and the company\u2019s competitors could result in a loss of customers or in additional competitive pricing pressures.\nNumerous initiatives and reforms instituted by legislators, regulators and third-party payors to reduce home\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nmedical equipment costs have resulted in a consolidation trend in the home medical equipment industry as well as among the company\u2019s customers, including home health care providers. In the past, some of the company\u2019s competitors, which may include distributors, have been lowering the purchase prices of their products in an effort to attract customers. This in turn has resulted in greater pricing pressures, including pressure to offer customers more competitive pricing terms, and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments as group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for some of the company\u2019s customers. Further consolidation could result in a loss of customers, increased collectability risks, or increased competitive pricing pressures. In addition, as reimbursement pressures persist in the U.S. market, the company is beginning to see some customers directly sourcing select lifestyle products to secure a low-cost advantage.\nThe company maintains cash balances globally in various financial institutions.\nWhile the company monitors its accounts with financial institutions both domestically and internationally, recovery of funds cannot be assured in the event the financial institution would fail. In addition, the company may be limited by foreign governments in the amount and timing of funds to be repatriated from foreign financial institutions. For example, the company's closure of it Suzhou, China facility requires the transfer of cash to settle intercompany balances and the eventual repatriation of cash upon legal dissolution. Any financial institution failure or repatriation delay could adversely impact the company's ability to fund normal operations, capital expenditures, or service debt, which could adversely affect the company's results.\nThe company is subject to certain risks inherent in managing and operating businesses in many different foreign jurisdictions.\nThe company has significant international operations, including operations in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Mexico, Asia (primarily China) and Europe. There are risks inherent in operating and selling products internationally, including:\n\u2022\ndifferent regulatory environments and reimbursement systems;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\nforeign customers who may have longer payment cycles than customers in the United States;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\ntax rates in certain foreign countries that may exceed those in the United States and foreign earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other trade restrictions including transfer pricing restrictions when products produced in one country are sold to an affiliated entity in another country;\n\u2022\npotential adverse changes in trade agreements between the United States and foreign countries, including the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) among the United States, Canada and Mexico;\n\u2022\npotential adverse changes in economic and political conditions in countries where the company operates or where end-users of the company\u2019s products reside, or in their diplomatic relations with the United States;\n\u2022\ngovernment control of capital transactions, including the borrowing of funds for operations or the expatriation of cash;\n\u2022\npotential adverse tax consequences, including those that may result from new United States tax laws, rules, regulations or policies;\n\u2022\nsecurity concerns and potential business interruption risks associated with political and/or social unrest in foreign countries where the company\u2019s facilities or assets are located;\n\u2022\ndifficulties associated with managing a large organization spread throughout various countries;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker intellectual property rights protection in some countries;\n\u2022\nrequired compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\ndiffering consumer product preferences.\nThe factors described above also could disrupt the company\u2019s product manufacturing and assembling operations or its key suppliers located outside of the United States, or increase the cost to the company of conducting those operations or using those suppliers. For example, the company relies on its manufacturing and sourcing operations in China and Mexico to produce its products. Disruptions in, or increased costs related to, the company\u2019s foreign operations, particularly those in China or Mexico, may impact the company\u2019s revenues and profitability.\nThe company may be adversely affected by legal actions or regulatory proceedings.\nIn addition to the risks associated with the impact of the FDA consent decree, the company may be subject to claims, litigation, governmental or regulatory investigations, or other liabilities as a result of injuries caused by allegedly defective products, or disputes arising out of dispositions the\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\ncompany has completed or relating to the company's intellectual property. Any such claims or litigation against the company, regardless of the merits, could result in substantial costs and could harm the company's business or its reputation.\nThe results of legal or regulatory actions or regulatory proceedings are difficult to predict and the company cannot provide any assurance that an action or proceeding will not be commenced against the company, or that the company will prevail in any such action or proceeding. An unfavorable resolution of any legal action or proceeding could materially and adversely affect the company's business, results of operations, liquidity or financial condition or its reputation.\nProduct liability claims may harm the company\u2019s business, particularly if the number of claims increases significantly or the company\u2019s product liability insurance proves inadequate.\nThe manufacture and sale of medical devices and related products exposes the company to a significant risk of product liability claims. From time to time, the company has been, and currently is, subject to a number of product liability claims alleging that the use of the company\u2019s products has resulted in serious injury or even death.\nEven if the company is successful in defending against any liability claims, these claims could nevertheless distract the company\u2019s management, result in substantial costs, harm the company\u2019s reputation, adversely affect the sales of all the company\u2019s products and otherwise harm the company\u2019s business. If there is a significant increase in the number of product liability claims, the company\u2019s business could be adversely affected.\nThe company is self-insured in North America for product liability exposures through its captive insurance company, Invatection Insurance Company, which currently has a policy year that runs from September 1 to August 31 and insures annual policy losses up to $10,000,000 per occurrence and $13,000,000 in the aggregate. The company also has additional layers of external insurance coverage, related to all lines of insurance coverage, insuring up to $75,000,000 in aggregate losses per policy year arising from individual claims anywhere in the world that exceed the captive insurance company policy limits or the limits of the company\u2019s per country foreign liability limits, as applicable. There can be no assurance that Invacare\u2019s current insurance levels will continue to be adequate or available at affordable rates.\nProduct liability reserves are recorded for individual claims based upon historical experience, industry expertise and indications from the third-party actuary. Additional reserves, in excess of the specific individual case reserves, are provided for incurred but not reported claims based upon actuarial valuations at the time such valuations are conducted. Historical claims experience and other assumptions are taken\ninto consideration to estimate the ultimate reserves. For example, the actuarial analysis assumes that historical loss experience is an indicator of future experience, that the distribution of exposures by geographic area and nature of operations for ongoing operations is expected to be very similar to historical operations with no dramatic changes and that the government indices used to trend losses and exposures are appropriate. Estimates made are adjusted on a regular basis and can be impacted by actual loss awards and settlements on claims. While actuarial analysis is used to help determine adequate reserves, the company is responsible for the determination and recording of adequate reserves in accordance with accepted loss reserving standards and practices. If the company's reserves are not adequate to cover actual claims experience, the company's financial results could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, as a result of a product liability claim or if the company\u2019s products are alleged to be defective, the company may have to recall some of its products, may have to incur significant costs or may suffer harm to its business reputation.\nDecreased availability or increased costs of materials could increase the company\u2019s costs of producing its products.\nThe company purchases raw materials, fabricated components, some finished goods and services from a variety of suppliers. Raw materials such as plastics, steel and aluminum are considered key raw materials. Where appropriate, the company employs contracts with its suppliers, both domestic and international. From time to time, however, the prices, availability, or quality of these materials fluctuate due to global market demands or economic conditions, which could impair the company\u2019s ability to procure necessary materials, or increase the cost of these materials. Inflationary and other increases in costs of these materials have occurred in the past and may recur from time to time. In addition, freight costs associated with shipping and receiving product and sales are impacted by fluctuations in the cost of oil and gas. A reduction in the supply or increase in the cost or change in quality of those materials could impact the company\u2019s ability to manufacture its products and could increase the cost of production. For example, the recently announced proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum to be imposed by the U.S. could have a significant on the company's cost of product. Additionally, the company may not be able to increase the prices of its products due to competitive pricing pressure or other factors. As an example, inflation in China has in the past and may in the future increase costs and an appreciation of the Yuan or an increase in labor rates could have an unfavorable impact on the cost of key components and some finished goods. Demand in China and other developing countries for raw materials may result in increases in the cost of key commodities and could have a negative impact on the profits of the company if these increases cannot be passed onto the company\u2019s customers.\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThe company's ability to manage an effective supply chain is a key success factor.\nThe company needs to manage its supply chain from sourcing to manufacturing and distribution. Successful supply chain management is based on building strong supplier relationships, and built on conforming, quality products delivered on-time and at a fair price. Cost reduction efforts depend on the company's execution of global and regional product platforms that create leverage in sourcing. If the company's supply chain management or cost reduction efforts are ineffective, the company's revenues and profitability can be negatively impacted.\nLower cost imports could negatively impact the company\u2019s profitability.\nCompetition from lower cost imports sourced from low cost countries, such as countries in Asia, may negatively impact the company\u2019s sales volumes. In the past, competition from certain of these products has caused the company to lower its prices, cutting into the company\u2019s profit margins and reducing the company\u2019s overall profitability.\nThe company\u2019s success depends on the company\u2019s ability to design, manufacture, distribute and achieve market acceptance of new products with higher functionality and lower costs.\nThe company sells products to customers primarily in markets that are characterized by technological change, product innovation and evolving industry standards, yet in which product price is increasingly a primary consideration in customers\u2019 purchasing decisions. The company historically has been engaged in product development and improvement programs. However, beginning in 2012 as a result of the FDA consent decree, which is described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the company's engineering resources had been more substantially focused on quality remediation activities displacing activities relating to the design of new products.\nThe company must continue to design and improve innovative products, effectively distribute and achieve market acceptance of those products, and reduce the costs of producing the company\u2019s products, in order to compete successfully with the company\u2019s competitors and to differentiate the company's brands from its competitors. If competitors\u2019 product development capabilities become more effective than the company\u2019s product development capabilities, if competitors\u2019 new or improved products are accepted by the market before the company\u2019s products or if competitors can produce products at a lower cost and thus offer products for sale at a lower price, the company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected.\nThe company\u2019s business strategy relies on certain assumptions concerning demographic trends that impact the market for its products. If these assumptions prove to be incorrect, demand for the company\u2019s products may be lower than expected.\nThe company\u2019s ability to achieve its business objectives is subject to a variety of factors, including the relative increase in the aging of the general population. The company believes that these trends will increase the need for its products. The projected demand for the company\u2019s products could materially differ from actual demand if the company\u2019s assumptions regarding these trends and acceptance of its products by health care professionals and patients prove to be incorrect or do not materialize. If the company\u2019s assumptions regarding these factors prove to be incorrect, the company may not be able to successfully implement the company\u2019s business strategy, which could adversely affect the company\u2019s results of operations. In addition, the perceived benefits of these trends may be offset by competitive or business factors, such as the introduction of new products by the company\u2019s competitors or the emergence of other countervailing trends, including lower reimbursement and pricing.\nThe terms of the company\u2019s debt facilities and financing arrangements may limit the company\u2019s flexibility in operating its business.\nThe company has outstanding $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 (the \u201c2021 Notes\u201d) and $120,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (the \u201c2022 Notes\u201d) and is a party to an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement that provides for asset-based lending senior secured revolving credit facilities which mature in January 2021. The credit agreement provides the company and certain of the company's U.S., Canadian, U.K. and French subsidiaries with the ability to borrow under senior secured revolving credit, letter of credit and swing line loan facilities. The aggregate borrowing availability under the credit facilities is determined based on borrowing base formulas set forth in the credit agreement. The credit facilities are secured by substantially all the company's domestic and Canadian assets, other than real estate, and by substantially all the personal property assets of the company's U.K. subsidiaries and all of the receivables of the company's French subsidiaries. The credit agreement contains customary default provisions, with certain grace periods and exceptions, that include, among other things, failure to pay amounts due, breach of covenants, representations or warranties, bankruptcy, the occurrence of a material adverse effect, exclusion from any medical reimbursement program, and an interruption of any material manufacturing facilities for more than ten consecutive days.\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThe restrictive terms of the company's credit agreement may limit the company\u2019s ability to conduct and expand its business and pursue its business strategies. The company\u2019s ability to comply with the provisions of its credit agreements can be affected by events beyond its control, including changes in general economic and business conditions, or by government enforcement actions, such as, for example, adverse impacts from the FDA consent decree of injunction. If the company is unable to comply with the provisions in the credit agreement, it could result in a default which could trigger acceleration of, or the right to accelerate, the related debt. Because of cross-default provisions in its agreements and instruments governing certain of the company's indebtedness, a default under the credit agreement could result in a default under, and the acceleration of, certain other company indebtedness. In addition, the company's lenders would be entitled to proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness.\nThe company's ability to meet its liquidity needs will depend on many factors, including the operating performance of the business, as well as the company's continued compliance with the covenants under its credit agreement. Notwithstanding the company's expectations, if the company's operating results decline, the company may be unable to comply with the financial covenants, and its lenders could demand repayment of the amounts outstanding under the company's credit facility.\nThe company also has an agreement with De Lage Landen, Inc. (\u201cDLL\u201d), a third-party financing company, to provide financing to the company's U.S. customers. Either party could terminate this agreement with 180 days' notice or 90 days' notice by DLL upon the occurrence of certain events. Should this agreement be terminated, the company's borrowing needs under the credit agreement could increase.\nThe company may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the 2021 Notes or 2022 Notes.\nUpon any conversion of the 2021 Notes or 2022 Notes prior to the company\u2019s receipt of shareholder approval to issue upon conversion of the notes more than 19.99% of the outstanding common shares, the company will be required to make cash payments in respect of the notes being converted. Unless the company obtains shareholder approval and elects to deliver solely common shares to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), the company will be required to make cash payments in respect of the notes being converted. Any requirement to deliver cash upon conversion of the notes could adversely affect the company\u2019s liquidity, and the company may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time it is required to pay cash in settlement of notes being converted.\nThe company's capital expenditures could be higher than anticipated.\nUnanticipated maintenance issues, changes in government regulations or significant investments in technology and new product development could result in higher than anticipated capital expenditures, which could impact the company's debt, interest expense and cash flows.\nThe company\u2019s operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if the company becomes involved in litigation regarding its patents or other intellectual property rights.\nLitigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the company\u2019s industry, and other companies within the company\u2019s industry have used intellectual property litigation in an attempt to gain a competitive advantage. The company in the past has been, and in the future may become, a party to lawsuits involving patents or other intellectual property. If the company were to receive an adverse judgment in any such proceeding, a court or a similar foreign governing body could invalidate or render unenforceable the company\u2019s owned or licensed patents, require the company to pay significant damages, seek licenses and/or pay ongoing royalties to third parties, require the company to redesign its products, or prevent the company from manufacturing, using or selling its products, any of which could have an adverse effect on the company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. The company in the past has brought, and may in the future also bring, actions against third parties for infringement of the company\u2019s intellectual property rights. The company may not succeed in these actions. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits, proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or its foreign equivalents and related legal and administrative proceedings are both costly and time consuming. Protracted litigation to defend or prosecute the company\u2019s intellectual property rights could seriously detract from the time the company\u2019s management would otherwise devote to running its business. Intellectual property litigation relating to the company\u2019s products could cause its customers or potential customers to defer or limit their purchase or use of the affected products until resolution of the litigation.\nIf the company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights or resolve successfully claims of infringement brought against it, the company's product sales and business could be affected adversely.\nThe company's business depends in part on its ability to establish, protect, safeguard and enforce its intellectual property and contractual rights and to defend against any claims of infringement, both of which involve complex legal, factual and marketplace uncertainties. The company relies on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark law and security measures to protect its intellectual\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nproperty, but effective intellectual property protection may not be available in all places that the company sells its products or services, particularly in certain foreign jurisdictions, and patents provide protection for finite time periods. In addition, the company uses nondisclosure, confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with many of its employees, and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements with certain third parties, in an effort to help protect its proprietary technology and know-how. If these agreements are breached or the company's intellectual property is otherwise infringed, misappropriated or violated, the company may have to rely on litigation to enforce its intellectual property rights. If any of these measures are unsuccessful in protecting the company's intellectual property, the company's business may be affected adversely.\nIn addition, the company may face claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violation of third parties\u2019 intellectual property that could interfere with its ability to use technology or other intellectual property rights that are material to the company's business operations. In the event that a claim of infringement, misappropriation or other violation against the company is successful, the company may be required to pay royalties or license fees to continue to use technology or other intellectual property rights that the company was using, or the company may be unable to obtain necessary licenses from third parties at a reasonable cost or within a reasonable time. If the company is unable to obtain licenses on reasonable terms, it may be forced to cease selling or using the products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property, or to redesign or, in the case of trademark claims, rename its products to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may not be possible, or if possible, may be time-consuming. Any litigation of this type, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs to the company and adversely affect the company's business and financial condition.\nThe company also holds patent and other intellectual property licenses from third parties for some of its products and on technologies that are necessary in the design and manufacture of some of the company's products. The loss of these licenses could prevent the company from, or could cause additional disruption or expense in, manufacturing, marketing and selling these products, which could harm the company's business.\nThe company\u2019s research and development and manufacturing processes are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental requirements.\nThe company\u2019s research and development and manufacturing processes are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental requirements, including requirements governing the discharge of pollutants into the air or water, the use, handling, storage and disposal of\nhazardous substances and the responsibility to investigate and clean up contaminated sites. Under some of these laws, the company also could be held responsible for costs relating to any contamination at the company\u2019s past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites. These could include costs relating to contamination that did not result from any violation of law and, in some circumstances, contamination that the company did not cause. The company may incur significant expenses relating to the failure to comply with environmental laws. The enactment of stricter laws or regulations, the stricter interpretation of existing laws and regulations or the requirement to undertake the investigation or remediation of currently unknown environmental contamination at the company\u2019s own or third-party sites may require the company to make additional expenditures, which could be material.\nThe company may be unable to make strategic acquisitions without obtaining amendments to its credit agreement.\nThe company\u2019s business plans historically included identifying, analyzing, acquiring, and integrating other strategic businesses. There are various reasons for the company to acquire businesses or product lines, including providing new products or new manufacturing and service capabilities, to add new customers, to increase penetration with existing customers, and to expand into new geographic markets. The provisions of the credit agreement restrict the company from undertaking certain acquisitions unless the company is able to negotiate and obtain amendments with regard to those provisions. If the company is unable to obtain the necessary amendments, it may miss opportunities to grow its business through strategic acquisitions.\nIn addition, an acquisition could materially impair the company\u2019s operating results by causing the company to incur debt or requiring the amortization of acquisition expenses and acquired assets.\nAdditional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect the company's future profitability and cash flow.\nThe company is subject to income taxes in the United States and various non-U.S. jurisdictions. The domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the allocation of income among these different jurisdictions. The company's tax expense includes estimates of additional tax which may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various other estimates and assumptions. In addition, the assumptions include assessments of future earnings of the company that could impact the valuation of its deferred tax assets. The company\u2019s future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the company's effective tax rate which could result from changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the overall profitability of the company, changes in tax legislation and\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nrates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of its tax exposures. Corporate tax reform and tax law changes continue to be analyzed in many jurisdictions, including the potential impacts of new United States tax laws, rules, regulations or policies, and any legislation or regulations which may result from those policies.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Act\u201d) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act significantly revamped U.S. taxation of corporations, including a reduction of the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a limitation on interest deductibility, and a new tax regime for foreign earnings. The limitation on interest deductibility, the new U.S. taxes on accumulated and future foreign earnings, other adverse changes resulting from the Tax Act, or a change in the mix of domestic and foreign earnings, might offset the benefit from the reduced tax rate, and the company\u2019s future effective tax rates and/or cash taxes may increase, even significantly, or not decrease much, compared to recent or historical trends. Many of the provisions of the Tax Act are highly complex and may be subject to further interpretive guidance from the IRS or others. Some of the provisions of the Tax Act may be changed by a future Congress or challenged by the World Trade Organization (\u201cWTO\u201d) or be subject to trade or tax retaliation by other countries. Although the company cannot predict the nature or outcome of such future interpretive guidance, or actions by a future Congress, WTO or other countries, they could adversely impact the company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe company\u2019s reported results may be adversely affected by increases in reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable.\nThe company has a large balance of accounts receivable and has established a reserve for the portion of such accounts receivable that the company estimates will not be collected because of the company\u2019s customers\u2019 non-payment. The specific reserve is based on historical trends and current relationships with the company\u2019s customers and providers. Changes in the company\u2019s collection rates can result from a number of factors, including turnover in personnel, changes in the payment policies or practices of payors, changes in industry rates or pace of reimbursement or changes in the financial health of the company\u2019s customers. As a result of past changes in Medicare reimbursement regulations, specifically changes to the qualification processes and reimbursement levels of consumer power wheelchairs and custom power wheelchairs, the business viability of some the company\u2019s customers may be at risk. Further, as National Competitive Bidding is implemented in additional areas, the number of start-up or new providers who have three-year contracted pricing will increase.\nThe company\u2019s reserve for uncollectible receivables has fluctuated in the past and will continue to fluctuate in the future. Changes in rates of collection, even if they are small in absolute terms, could require the company to increase its reserve for uncollectible receivables beyond its current level. The company has reviewed the accounts receivables, including those receivables financed through DLL, associated with many of its customers that are most exposed to these issues. If the business viability of certain of the company\u2019s customers deteriorates or the company\u2019s credit policies are ineffective in reducing the company\u2019s exposures to credit risk, additional increases in reserves for uncollectible accounts may be necessary, which could adversely affect the company\u2019s financial results.\nThe inability to attract and retain, or loss of the services of, the company\u2019s key management and personnel could adversely affect its ability to operate the company\u2019s business.\nThe company\u2019s future success will depend, in part, upon the continued service of key managerial, research and development staff and sales and technical personnel. In addition, the company\u2019s future success will depend on its ability to continue to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel, including personnel experienced in quality systems and regulatory affairs. If the company is not successful in retaining its current personnel or in hiring or retaining qualified personnel in the future, the company\u2019s business may be adversely affected. The company\u2019s future success depends, to a significant extent, on the abilities and efforts of its executive officers and other members of its management team, such as the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and its Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as well as other members of its management team. The company had significant turnover in its management team in recent years and cannot be certain that its executive officers and other key employees will continue in their respective capacities for any period of time, and these employees may be difficult to replace. If the company loses the services of any of its management team, the company\u2019s business may be adversely affected.\nCertain provisions of the company\u2019s debt agreements, its charter documents, and Ohio law could delay or prevent a sale or change in control of the company.\nProvisions of the company\u2019s credit agreement, its charter documents, and Ohio law may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of the company even if a change in control would result in the purchase of shares of the company at a premium to market price. In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of shareholders of the company to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interest.\nPart I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nDifficulties in implementing or upgrading the company\u2019s Enterprise Resource Planning systems may disrupt the company\u2019s business.\nThe company is in the process of upgrading its Enterprise Resource Planning, or \u201cERP,\u201d system in Europe and may undertake further deployment of systems in other geographies of parts of the business. The complexities and business process changes associated with such an ERP upgrade can result in various difficulties including problems processing and fulfilling orders, customer disruptions and lost business. While the company believes the potential difficulties associated with upgrading the company\u2019s primary ERP system in Europe have been addressed or can be mitigated, there can be no assurance that the company will not experience disruptions or inefficiencies in the company\u2019s business operations as a result of the upgrade which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nThe Company May Experience Volatility in the Market Price of its Common Shares\nThe market price of the company\u2019s common shares may be influenced by lower trading volume and concentrated ownership relative to many other publicly-held companies. Because several of the company\u2019s shareholders own significant amounts of the company\u2019s outstanding common shares, the common shares are relatively less liquid and therefore more susceptible to price fluctuations than many other companies\u2019 shares. If any one or more of these shareholders were to sell all or a portion of their holdings of company common shares at once or within short periods of time, or there was an expectation that such a sale was imminent, then the market price of the company\u2019s common shares could be negatively affected.", "PERMNO": 45728, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "IVC"}
