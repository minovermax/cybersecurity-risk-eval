{"cik": "1495932", "company": "EXP World Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nOur management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in \u201cInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\u201d issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). Under auditing standards established by the U.S. Public Company Oversight Board, a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis.\nDuring its evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2019, management identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting related to user access and program change-management over information technology and business process controls that are dependent on affected information technology general controls and implementing key components of the COSO framework including information and communication, control activities and monitoring.\nSee Part II, Item 9 - \u201cControls and Procedures.\u201d\nWhile we are in the process of identifying and implementing remedial measures to address the control deficiencies that led to the material weaknesses, there can be no assurance that remedial measures will prevent other control deficiencies or material weaknesses. We may identify additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. If we are unable to remediate the material weaknesses or we identify additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to analyze, record and report financial information free of material misstatements, and to prepare our financial statements within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the SEC may be adversely affected. The occurrence of, or failure to remediate, the material weaknesses and any\nfurther material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may result in material misstatements as well as negatively impact the reliability of our financial statements, our reputation, our business and the trading price of our common stock, potentially leading to the suspension of trading on or delisting of our common stock from the NASDAQ stock exchange.\nWe have experienced net losses in recent years, and because we have a limited operating history, our ability to fully and successfully develop our business is unknown.\nWe have a history of operating at losses since our inception in October 2009. Our ability to realize consistent, meaningful revenues and profit over a sustained period has not been established and cannot be assured.\nWhile we believe that we have made significant progress in revenue growth and managing our overhead by implementing our cloud-based technology strategy, our services must achieve broad market acceptance by consumers and we must continue to grow our geographical reach, attract more agents and brokers, and increase the volume of our residential real-estate transactions. If we are unsuccessful in continuing to gain market acceptance, we will not be able to generate sufficient revenue to continue our business operations and could sustain on-going operating and net losses.\nDespite our ongoing efforts to build revenue growth, both organically and through acquisitions, and to control the anticipated expenses associated with the continued development, marketing and provision of our services, we may not be able to generate significant net income from operations in the future.\nOur profitability is tied to the strength of the residential real estate market, which is subject to a number of general business and macroeconomic conditions beyond our control.\nOur profitability is closely related to the strength of the residential real estate market which is cyclical in nature and typically is affected by changes in national, state and local economic conditions which are beyond our control. Macroeconomic conditions that could adversely impact the growth of the real estate market and have a material adverse effect on our business include, but are not limited to, economic slowdown or recession, increased unemployment, increased energy costs, reductions in the availability of credit or higher interest rates, increased costs of obtaining mortgages, an increase in foreclosure activity, inflation, disruptions in capital markets, declines in the stock market, adverse tax policies or changes in other regulations, lower consumer confidence, lower wage and salary levels, war or terrorist attacks, natural disasters or adverse weather events, or the public perception that any of these events may occur. Unfavorable general economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown, in the United States, Canada or other markets we enter and operate within could negatively affect the affordability of, and consumer demand for, our services which could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability. In addition, federal and state governments, agencies and government-sponsored entities such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could take actions that result in unforeseen consequences to the real estate market or that otherwise could negatively impact our business.\nThe real estate market is substantially reliant on the monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies and is particularly affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve Board, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S., which in turn impacts interest rates. Our business could be negatively impacted by any rising interest rate environment. As mortgage rates rise, the number of home sale transactions may decrease as potential home sellers choose to stay with their lower mortgage rate rather than sell their home and pay a higher mortgage rate with the purchase of another home. Similarly, in higher interest rate environments, potential home buyers may choose to rent rather than pay higher mortgage rates. Changes in the interest rate environment and mortgage market are beyond our control, are difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability.\nWe may be unable to maintain our agent growth rate, which would adversely affect our revenue growth and results of operations.\nWe have experienced rapid and accelerating growth in our real estate broker and agent base. During the year ended December 31, 2019, our net agent and broker base grew by 63.3%, from 15,570 agents and brokers at December 31, 2018, to 25,423 agents and brokers at December 31, 2019. Because we derive revenue from real estate transactions in which our brokers and agents receive commissions, increases in our agent and broker base correlate to increases in\nrevenues, and the rate of growth of our revenue correlates to the rate of growth of our agent and broker base. The rate of growth of our agent and broker base cannot be predicted and is subject to many factors outside of our control, including actions taken by our competitors and macroeconomic factors affecting the real estate industry generally. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our recent agent growth rate or that our agent and broker base will continue to expand in future periods. A slowdown in our agent growth rate would have a material adverse effect on revenue growth and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may be unable to effectively manage rapid growth in our business.\nWe may not be able to scale our business quickly enough to meet the growing needs of our affiliated real estate professionals and if we are not able to grow efficiently, our operating results could be harmed. As the Company adds new real estate professionals, we will need to devote additional financial and human resources to improving our internal systems, integrating with third-party systems, and maintaining infrastructure performance. In addition, we will need to appropriately scale our internal business systems and our services organization, including support of our affiliated real estate professionals as our demographics expand over time. Any failure of or delay in these efforts could cause impaired system performance and reduced real estate professional satisfaction. These issues could reduce the attractiveness of our Company to existing real estate professionals who might leave the Company as well as resulting in decreased attraction of new real estate professionals. Even if we are able to upgrade our systems and expand our staff, such expansion may be expensive, complex, and place increasing demands on our management. We could also face inefficiencies or operational failures as a result of our efforts to scale our infrastructure and we may not be successful in maintaining adequate financial and operating systems and controls as we expand. Moreover, there are inherent risks associated with upgrading, improving and expanding our information technology systems. We cannot be sure that the expansion and improvements to our infrastructure and systems will be fully or effectively implemented on a timely basis, if at all. These efforts may reduce revenue and our margins and adversely impact our financial results.\nIf we fail to grow in the various local markets that we serve or are unsuccessful in identifying and pursuing new business opportunities our long-term prospects and profitability will be harmed.\nTo capture and retain market share in the various local markets that we serve, we must compete successfully against other brokerages for agents and brokers and for the consumer relationships that they bring. Our competitors could lower the fees that they charge to agents and brokers or could raise the compensation structure for those agents. Our competitors may have access to greater financial resources than us, allowing them to undertake expensive local advertising or marketing efforts. In addition, our competitors may be able to leverage local relationships, referral sources, and strong local brand and name recognition that we have not established. Our competitors could, as a result, have greater leverage in attracting new and established agents in the market and in generating business among local consumers. Our ability to grow in the local markets that we serve will depend on our ability to compete with these local brokerages.\nWe may implement changes to our business model and operations to improve revenues that cause a disproportionate increase in our expenses or reduce profit margins. For example, we may allocate resources to acquiring lower margin brokerage models, the development of a mortgage servicing division, a commercial real estate division, a title and escrow company or a continuing education division. Expanding our service offerings could involve significant up-front costs that may only be recovered after lengthy periods of time. Any of these attempts to pursue new business opportunities could result in a disproportionate increase in our expenses and in reduced profit margins. In addition, any of these additional activities could expose us to additional compliance obligations and regulatory risks.\nIf we fail to continue to grow in the local markets we serve or if we fail to successfully identify and pursue new business opportunities, our long-term prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed, and our stock price may decline.\nThe utilization of a 3D cloud based immersive office as a suitable substitute for a physical brick and mortar location is a new and unproven strategy and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to operate and grow within its confines.\nCurrently, our cloud office adequately supports the needs of our agent population located across the markets we serve. We cannot guarantee that our cloud office platform will continue to support our agent population and meet our business needs as we grow. The effectiveness of our cloud office platform is tied to a number of variables at any given time including server capacity and concurrent users. In addition, the use of the cloud office platform, and the use generally of 3D immersive office environments as an acceptable substitute among agents and brokers for physical office locations is unproven. We cannot guarantee that industry rank and file will adopt or accept cloud-based 3D office environments as a substitute for a physical office environment in a sustainable, long-term manner.\nWe intend to evaluate acquisitions or investments in third-party technologies and businesses, but we may not realize the anticipated benefits from, and may have to pay substantial costs related to, any acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures, or investments that we undertake.\nAs part of our business and growth strategy, we evaluate acquisitions of, or investments in, a wide array of potential strategic opportunities, including third-party technologies and businesses as well as other real estate brokerages. If we are not able to integrate acquisitions, or execute on joint venture strategies, successfully, our operating results and prospects could be harmed. Since 2018, we have acquired new technology and operations and entered into joint venture arrangements. We will continue to look for opportunities to acquire technologies or operations that we believe will contribute to our growth and development. The success of our future acquisition strategy will depend on our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate acquisitions. The success of our future joint venture strategies will depend on our ability to identify, negotiate, complete, and successfully manage joint ventures with other parties. In addition, acquisitions and joint ventures could cause potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or incurrence of debt.\nAcquisitions and joint ventures are inherently risky, and any we complete may not be successful. Any acquisitions and joint ventures we pursue would involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in integrating and managing the operations and technologies of the companies we acquire, including higher than expected integration costs and longer integration periods;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of our management\u2019s attention from normal daily operations of our business;\n\u00b7\nour inability to maintain the customers, key employees, key business relationships and reputations of the businesses we acquire;\n\u00b7\nour inability to generate sufficient revenue or business efficiencies from acquisitions or joint ventures to offset our increased expenses associated with acquisitions or joint ventures;\n\u00b7\nour responsibility for the liabilities of the businesses we acquire or gain ownership in through joint ventures, including, without limitation, liabilities arising out of their failure to maintain effective data security, data integrity, disaster recovery and privacy controls prior to the acquisition, or their infringement or alleged infringement of third party intellectual property, contract or data access rights prior to the acquisition;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in complying with new markets or regulatory standards to which we were not previously subject;\n\u00b7\ndelays in our ability to implement internal standards, controls, procedures and policies in the businesses we acquire or gain ownership in through joint ventures and increased risk that our internal controls will be ineffective;\n\u00b7\noperations in a nascent state depend directly on utilization by eXp Realty agents and brokers;\n\u00b7\nadverse effects of acquisition and joint venture activity on the key performance indicators we use to monitor our performance as a business; and\n\u00b7\ninability to fully realize intangible assets recognized through acquisitions or joint ventures and related non-cash impairment charges that may result if we are required to revalue such intangible assets.\nOur failure to address these risks or any other challenges we encounter with our future acquisitions, joint ventures and investments could cause us to not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business, which could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nWe face significant risk to our brand and revenue if we fail to maintain compliance with the law and regulations of federal, state, county and foreign governmental authorities, or private associations and governing boards.\nWe operate in a heavily regulated industry subject to complex, federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations within the markets in which we operate and third-party organizations\u2019 regulations, policies and bylaws governing the real estate business.\nIn general, the laws, rules and regulations that apply to our business practices include, without limitation, RESPA. the federal Fair Housing Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, and federal advertising and other laws, as well as comparable state statutes; rules of trade organizations such as NAR, local MLSs, and state and local AORs; licensing requirements and related obligations that could arise from our business practices relating to the provision of services other than real estate brokerage services; privacy regulations relating to our use of personal information collected from the registered users of our websites; laws relating to the use and publication of information through the Internet; and state real estate brokerage licensing requirements, as well as statutory due diligence, disclosure, record keeping and standard-of-care obligations relating to these licenses.\nAdditionally, the Dodd-Frank Act contains the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act (\u201cMortgage Act\u201d), which imposes a number of additional requirements on lenders and servicers of residential mortgage loans, by amending certain existing provisions and adding new sections to RESPA and other federal laws. It also broadly prohibits unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, and knowingly or recklessly providing substantial assistance to a covered person in violation of that prohibition. The penalties for noncompliance with these laws are also significantly increased by the Mortgage Act, which could lead to an increase in lawsuits against mortgage lenders and servicers.\nAs we expand our business into new markets, including the United Kingdom and Australia, we are subject to additional foreign governmental regulation. Ensuring compliance with these newly applicable laws could substantially increase our operating expenses. In addition, entry into these new markets exposes us to increased risk and liability. For example, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) confers significant privacy rights on individuals (including employees and independent agents), and materially increased penalties for violations. A violation of any of these applicable laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMaintaining legal compliance is challenging and increases our costs due to resources required to continually monitor business practices for compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, and to monitor changes in the applicable laws themselves.\nWe may not become aware of all the laws, rules and regulations that govern our business, or be able to comply with all of them, given the rate of regulatory changes, ambiguities in regulations, contradictions in regulations between jurisdictions, and the difficulties in achieving both company-wide and region-specific knowledge and compliance.\nIf we fail, or we have alleged to have failed, to comply with any existing or future applicable laws, rules and regulations, we could be subject to lawsuits and administrative complaints and proceedings, as well as criminal proceedings. Our noncompliance could result in significant defense costs, settlement costs, damages and penalties.\nOur business licenses could be suspended or revoked, our business practices enjoined, or we could be required to modify our business practices, which could materially impair, or even prevent, our ability to conduct all or any portion of our business. Any such events could also damage our reputation and impair our ability to attract and service home buyers, home sellers and agents, as well our ability to attract brokerages, brokers, teams of agents and agents to our company, without increasing our costs.\nFurther, if we lose our ability to obtain and maintain all of the regulatory approvals and licenses necessary to conduct business as we currently operate, our ability to conduct business may be harmed. Lastly, any lobbying or related activities we undertake in response to mitigate liability of current or new regulations could substantially increase our operating expenses.\nWe may suffer significant financial harm and loss of reputation if we do not comply, cannot comply, or are alleged to have not complied with applicable laws, rules and regulations concerning our classification and compensation practices for the agents in our owned-and-operated brokerage.\nExcept for our employed state brokers and commission only employees, all real estate professionals in our brokerage operations have been retained as independent contractors, either directly or indirectly through third-party entities formed by these independent contractors for their business purposes. With respect to these independent contractors, like most brokerage firms, we are subject to the taxing authorities\u2019 regulations and applicable laws regarding independent contractor classification. These regulations and guidelines are subject to judicial and agency interpretation, and it might be determined that the independent contractor classification is inapplicable to any of our affiliated real estate professionals. Further, if legal standards for classification of real estate professionals as independent contractors change or appear to be changing, it may be necessary to modify our compensation and benefits structure for our affiliated real estate professionals in some or all of our markets, including by paying additional compensation or reimbursing expenses.\nIn the future we could incur substantial costs, penalties and damages, including back pay, unpaid benefits, taxes, expense reimbursement and attorneys\u2019 fees, in defending future challenges by our affiliated real estate professionals to our employment classification or compensation practices.\nOur international operations are subject to risks not generally experienced by our U.S. operations.\nIn addition to operating in Canada, in 2019 we expanded our business into Australia and the United Kingdom. Our international operations are subject to risks not generally experienced by our U.S. operations. The risks involved in our international operations and relationships that could result in losses against which we are not insured and therefore affect our profitability include:\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7\nexposure to local economic conditions and local laws and regulations;\n\u00b7\nemployment laws that are significantly different that U.S. laws;\n\u00b7\ndiminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights and use of our trademarks in foreign countries;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in registering, protecting or preserving trade names and trademarks in foreign countries;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the ability to obtain or retain licenses required for operations;\n\u00b7\nwithholding and other taxes on third party cross-border transactions as well as remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n\u00b7\nonerous requirements, subject to broad interpretation, for indirect taxes and income taxes that can result in audits with potentially significant financial outcomes;\n\u00b7\nchanges in foreign taxation structures;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act or similar laws of other countries;\n\u00b7\nuncertainties and effects of the implementation of the United Kingdom\u2019s referendum to withdraw membership from the European Union (referred to as Brexit), including financial, legal and tax implications; and\n\u00b7\nregional and country specific data protection and privacy laws including the GDPR.\nIn addition, activities of agents and brokers outside of the U.S. are more difficult and more expensive to monitor and improper activities or mismanagement may be more difficult to detect. Negligent or improper activities involving our agents and brokers may result in reputational damage to us and may lead to direct claims against us based on theories of vicarious liability, negligence, joint operations and joint employer liability which, if determined adversely, could increase costs, negatively impact the business prospects of our franchisees and subject us to incremental liability for their actions.\nIf we do not remain an innovative leader in the real estate industry, we may not be able to grow our business and leverage our costs to achieve profitability.\nInnovation has been critical to our ability to compete against other brokerages for clients and agents. For example, we have pioneered the utilization of a 3D immersive online office environment in the real estate market which reduces our need for office space and facilitates the transaction of business away from an office. If competitors follow our practices or develop innovative practices, our ability to achieve profitability may diminish or erode. For example, certain other brokerages could develop or license cloud-based office platforms that are equal to or superior to ours. If we do not remain on the forefront of innovation, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.\nThe market for Internet products and services including, without limitation, 3D immersive experiences, virtual reality and augmented reality is characterized by rapid technological developments, evolving industry standards and consumer demands, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. The Company\u2019s future success will depend in significant part on its ability to continually improve the performance, features and reliability of its Internet-based virtual environment, its tools and other properties in response to both evolving demands of the marketplace and competitive product offerings, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in doing so. In addition, the widespread adoption of new virtual reality and augmented reality applications through new technology developments could require fundamental changes in the Company\u2019s services.\nOur value proposition for agents and brokers includes allowing them to participate in the revenues of our company and is not typical in the real estate industry. If agents and brokers do not understand our value proposition we may not be able to attract, retain and incentivize agents.\nParticipation in our gross revenue sharing plan represents a key component of our agent and broker value proposition. Agents and brokers may not understand or appreciate its value. In addition, agents may not appreciate other components of our value proposition including the cloud office platform, the mobility it affords, the systems and tools that we provide to agents and brokers, and the professional development opportunities we create and deliver. If agents and brokers do not understand the elements of our agent value proposition, or do not perceive it to be more valuable than the models used by most competitors, we may not be able to attract, retain and incentivize new and existing agents and brokers to grow our revenues.\nWe offer our independent agents the opportunity to earn a portion of their commissions through our revenue share program which pays under a multi-tiered compensation structure similar in some respects to network marketing. Network marketing is subject to intense government scrutiny, and regulation and changes in the law, or the interpretation and enforcement of the law, might adversely affect our business.\nVarious laws and regulations in the United States and other countries regulate network marketing. These laws and regulations exist at many levels of government in many different forms, including statutes, rules, regulations, judicial decisions, and administrative orders. Network marketing regulations are inherently fact-based and often do not include \"bright line\" rules. Additionally, we are subject to the risk that the regulations, or a regulator's interpretation and enforcement of the regulations, could change. From time to time, we have received requests to supply information regarding our revenue share plan to regulatory agencies. We could potentially in the future be required to modify our revenue sharing plan in certain jurisdictions in order to comply with the interpretation of the regulations by local authorities.\nIn the United States, the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) has entered into several highly publicized settlements with network marketing companies that required those companies to modify their compensation plans and business models. Those settlements resulted from actions brought by the FTC involving a variety of alleged violations of consumer protection laws, including misleading earnings representations by the companies' independent distributors, as well as the legal validity of the companies' business model and distributor compensation plans. FTC determinations such as these have created an ambiguity regarding the proper interpretation of the law and regulations applicable to network marketing companies in the U.S. Although a consent decree between the FTC and a specific company does not represent judicial precedent, FTC officials have indicated that the network marketing industry should look to these consent decrees, and the principles contained therein, for guidance. Additionally, following the issuance of these consent decrees, the FTC\nissued non-binding guidance to the network marketing industry, suggesting it was intending to reinforce the principles contained in the consent decrees and provide other operational guidance to the network marketing industry.\nWhile we strive to ensure that our overall business model, and revenue share plan, are regulatory compliant in each of our markets, we cannot assure you that a regulator, if it were to review our business, would agree with our assessment and would not require us to change one or more aspects of our operations. Any action against us in the future by the FTC or another regulator could materially and adversely affect our operations.\nWe cannot predict the nature of any future law, regulation, or guidance, nor can we predict what effect additional governmental regulations, judicial decisions, or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on our business. Failure by us, or our independent agents, to comply with these laws, could adversely affect our business.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel.\nTo execute our business strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. In particular, we compete with many other real estate brokerages for qualified brokers who manage our operations in each state. We must also compete with technology companies for developers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing cloud-based software, as well as for skilled service and operations professionals, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the professionals we need. Additionally, in order to realize the potential benefits of acquisitions, we may need to retain employees from the acquired businesses or hire additional personnel to fully capitalize on the opportunities that such acquisitions may offer, and we may not be successful in retaining or attracting such individuals following an acquisition. From time to time in the past we have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and difficulty in retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we do. In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the software industry, job candidates often consider the value of the stock options or other equity incentives they are to receive in connection with their employment. If the price of our stock declines, or continues to experience significant volatility, our ability to attract or retain key employees may be adversely affected. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our growth prospects could be severely harmed.\nOur operating results are subject to seasonality and vary significantly among quarters during each calendar year, making meaningful comparisons of successive quarters difficult.\nSeasons and weather traditionally impact the real estate industry. Continuous poor weather or natural disasters negatively impact listings and sales. Spring and summer seasons historically reflect greater sales periods in comparison to fall and winter seasons. We have historically experienced lower revenues during the fall and winter seasons, as well as during periods of unseasonable weather, which reduces our operating income, net income, operating margins and cash flow.\nReal estate listings precede sales and a period of poor listings activity will negatively impact revenue. Past performance in similar seasons or during similar weather events can provide no assurance of future or current performance, and macroeconomic shifts in the markets we serve can conceal the impact of poor weather or seasonality.\nHome sales in successive quarters can fluctuate widely due to a wide variety of factors, including holidays, national or international emergencies, the school year calendar\u2019s impact on timing of family relocations, interest rate changes, speculation of pending interest rate changes and the overall macroeconomic market. Our revenue and operating margins each quarter will remain subject to seasonal fluctuations, poor weather and natural disasters and macroeconomic market changes that may make it difficult to compare or analyze our financial performance effectively across successive quarters.\nIf we fail to protect the privacy of employees, independent contractors, or consumers or personal information that they share with us, our reputation and business could be significantly harmed.\nHundreds of thousands of consumers, independent contractors, and employees have shared personal information with us during the normal course of our business processing real estate transactions. This includes, but is not limited to, social security numbers, annual income amounts and sources, consumer names, addresses, telephone and cell phone numbers, and email addresses.\nThe Application, disclosure and safeguarding of this information is regulated by federal and state privacy laws. To comply with privacy laws, we invested resources and adopted a privacy policy outlining policies and procedures for the use of safeguarding personal information. This policy includes informing consumers, independent contractors and employees that we will not share their personal information with third parties without their consent unless required by law.\nPrivacy policies and compliance with federal and state privacy laws presents risk and we could incur legal liability for failing to maintain compliance. We may not become aware of all privacy laws, changes to privacy laws, or third- party privacy regulations governing the real estate business or be unable to comply with all of these regulations, given the rate of regulatory changes, ambiguities in regulations, contradictions in regulations between jurisdictions, and the difficulties in achieving both company-wide and region-specific knowledge and compliance.\nOur policy and safeguards could be deemed insufficient if third parties with whom we have shared personal information fail to protect the privacy of that information. Our legal liability could include significant defense costs, settlement costs, damages and penalties, plus, damage our reputation with consumers, which could significantly damage our ability to attract customers. Any or all of these consequences would result in meaningful unfavorable impact on our brand, business model, revenue, expenses, income and margins.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we are unable to expand, maintain and improve the systems and technologies which we rely on to operate.\nAs the number of agents and brokers in our company grows, our success will depend on our ability to expand, maintain and improve the technology that supports our business operations, including, but not limited to, our cloud office platform. Loss of key personnel or the lack of adequate staffing with the requisite expertise and training could impede our efforts in this regard. If our systems and technologies lack capacity or quality sufficient to service agents and their clients, then the number of agents who wish to use our products could decrease, the level of client service and transaction volume afforded by our systems could suffer, and our costs could increase. In addition, if our systems, procedures or controls are not adequate to provide reliable, accurate and timely financial and other reporting, we may not be able to satisfy regulatory scrutiny or contractual obligations with third parties and may suffer a loss of reputation. Any of these events could negatively affect our financial position.\nOur business, financial condition and reputation may be substantially harmed by security breaches, interruptions, delays and failures in our systems and operations.\nThe performance and reliability of our systems and operations are critical to our reputation and ability to attract agents, teams of agents and brokers into our company as well as our ability to service home buyers and sellers. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to security breaches, interruption or malfunction due to certain events beyond our control, including natural disasters, such as earthquakes, fire and flood, power loss, telecommunication failures, break-ins, sabotage, computer viruses, intentional acts of vandalism and similar events. In addition, we rely on third party vendors to provide the cloud office platform and to provide additional systems and related support. If we cannot continue to retain these services on acceptable terms, our access to these systems and services could be interrupted. Any security breach, interruption, delay or failure in our systems and operations could substantially reduce the transaction volume that can be processed with our systems, impair quality of service, increase costs, prompt litigation and other consumer claims, and damage our reputation, any of which could substantially harm our financial condition.\nLoss of our current executive officers or other key management could significantly harm our business.\nWe depend on the industry experience and talent of our current executives. We believe that our future results will depend in part upon our ability to retain and attract highly skilled and qualified management. The loss of our executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our operations because other officers may not have the experience and expertise to readily replace these individuals. To the extent that one or more of our top executives or other key management personnel depart from the Company, our operations and business prospects may be adversely affected. In addition, changes in executives and key personnel could be disruptive to our business. The Company does not have any key person insurance.\nFailure to protect intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.\nOur intellectual property rights, including existing and future trademarks, trade secrets, patents and copyrights, are important assets of the business. We have taken measures to protect our intellectual property, but these measures may not be sufficient or effective. We may bring lawsuits to protect against the potential infringement of our intellectual property rights and other companies, including our competitors, could make claims against us alleging our infringement of their intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that we would prevail in such lawsuits. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business.\nCybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, adversely impact our reputation and harm our business.\nCybersecurity threats and incidents directed at us could range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems to sophisticated and targeted measures aimed at disrupting business or gathering personal data of customers. In the ordinary course of our business, we and our agents and brokers collect and store sensitive data, including proprietary business information and personal information about our customers. Our business, and particularly our cloud-based platform, is reliant on the uninterrupted functioning of our information technology systems. The secure processing, maintenance, and transmission of information are critical to our operations, especially the processing and closing of real estate transactions. Although we employ measures designed to prevent, detect, address, and mitigate these threats (including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, and maintenance of backup and protective systems), cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption, or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties, including potentially sensitive personally information of our customers) and the disruption of business operations. Any such compromises to our security could cause harm to our reputation, which could cause customers to lose trust and confidence in us, or could cause agents and brokers to stop working for us. In addition, we may incur significant costs for remediation that may include liability for stolen assets or information, repair of system damage, and compensation to customers and business partners. We may also be subject to legal claims, government investigation, and additional state and federal statutory requirements.\nThe potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include regulatory violations of applicable U.S. and foreign privacy and other laws, reputational damage, loss of market value, litigation with third parties (which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability), diminution in the value of the services we provide to our customers, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs (that may include liability for stolen assets or information), which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our competitiveness and results of operations.\nIf we fail to protect the privacy and personal information of our customers, agents or employees, we may be subject to legal claims, government action and damage to our reputation.\nTo run our business, it is essential for us to store and transmit sensitive personal information about our customers, prospects, employees, and independent agents in our systems and networks. At the same time, we are subject to numerous laws, regulations, and other requirements that require businesses like ours to protect the security of personal information, notify customers and other individuals about our privacy practices, and limit the use, disclosure, or transfer of personal data across country borders. Regulators in the U.S. and abroad continue to enact comprehensive new laws or legislative reforms imposing significant privacy and cybersecurity restrictions. The result is that we are subject to\nincreased regulatory scrutiny, additional contractual requirements from corporate customers, and heightened compliance costs. These ongoing changes to privacy and cybersecurity laws also may make it more difficult for us to operate our business and may have a material adverse effect on our operations. For example, the European Union\u2019s GDPR conferred new and significant privacy rights on individuals (including employees and independent agents), and materially increased penalties for violations. In the U.S., California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act-which is expected to go into full effect in 2020-imposing new and comprehensive requirements on organizations that collect and disclose personal information about California residents. In March 2017, the New York Department of Financial Services\u2019 cybersecurity regulation went into effect, requiring regulated financial institutions to establish a detailed cybersecurity program. Program requirements included corporate governance, incident planning, data management, system testing, vendor oversight, and regulator notification rules. Now, other state regulatory agencies are expected to enact similar requirements following the adoption of the Insurance Data Security Model Law by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that is consistent with the New York regulation.\nAny significant violations of privacy and cybersecurity could result in the loss of new or existing business, litigation, regulatory investigations, the payment of fines, damages, and penalties and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe could also be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, while we disclose our information collection and dissemination practices in a published privacy statement on our websites, which we may modify from time to time, we may be subject to legal claims, government action and damage to our reputation if we act or are perceived to be acting inconsistently with the terms of our privacy statement, customer expectations or state, national and international regulations.\nThe occurrence of a significant claim in excess of our insurance coverage in any given period could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations during the period. In the event we or the vendors with which we contract to provide services on behalf of our customers were to suffer a breach of personal information, our customers and independent agents could terminate their business with us. Further, we may be subject to claims to the extent individual employees or independent contractors breach or fail to adhere to Company policies and practices and such actions jeopardize any personal information.\nIn addition, concern among potential home buyers or sellers about our privacy practices could result in regulatory investigations, especially in the European Union as related to the GDPR. Additionally, concern among potential home buyers or sellers could keep them from using our services or require us to incur significant expense to alter our business practices or educate them about how we use personal information.\nWe are subject to certain risks related to litigation filed by or against us, and adverse results may harm our business and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risk of, and are from time to time involved in, or may in the future be subject to, claims, suits, government investigations, and proceedings arising from our business, including actions with respect to intellectual property, privacy, information security, data protection or law enforcement matters, tax matters, labor and employment, including claims challenging the classification of our agents and brokers as independent contractors and compliance with wage and hour regulations, and claims alleging violations of RESPA or state consumer fraud statutes, and commercial arrangements. We are also subject to risk related to shareholder derivative actions, standard brokerage disputes like the failure to disclose hidden defects in a property such as mold, vicarious liability based upon conduct of individuals or entities outside of our control, including our agents, brokers, third-party service or product providers, and purported class action lawsuits.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the cost of defense, the cost of prosecution, insurance coverage or the ultimate outcome of litigation and other proceedings filed by or against us, including remedies or damage awards. Adverse results in such litigation and other proceedings may harm our business and financial condition. Class action lawsuits can often be particularly burdensome given the breadth of claims, large potential damages and significant costs of defense. In the case of intellectual property litigation and proceedings, adverse outcomes could include the cancellation, invalidation or other loss of material intellectual property rights used in our business and injunctions prohibiting our use of business processes or technology that is subject to third party patents or other third party intellectual property rights. In addition, we may be required to enter into licensing agreements (if available on acceptable terms) and be required to pay royalties.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. At present, we are not involved in any material pending legal proceeding, and there are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest.\nRisk Related to Our Stock\nGlenn Sanford, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, together with Penny Sanford, a significant shareholder, own a significant percentage of our stock, and as a result, the trading price for our shares may be depressed and they can take actions that may be adverse to the interests of our stockholders.\nGlenn Sanford beneficially owns approximately 35% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2019. Penny Sanford beneficially owns approximately 25% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2019. In December 2017 Mr. Sanford and Ms. Sanford filed a Schedule 13D with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) indicating that they had entered into an agreement to vote their shares as a group with respect to the election of directors and any other matter on which our shares of common stock are entitled to vote. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with a controlling stockholder group. The group can significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election and removal of directors and any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, due to his significant ownership stake and his service as our Principal Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board and Directors, Mr. Sanford controls the management of our business and affairs. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, or impeding a merger or consolidation, takeover or other business combination that could be favorable to our other stockholders.\nBecause we can issue additional shares of common stock, our stockholders may experience dilution in the future.\nWe are authorized to issue up to 220,000,000 shares of common stock, of which approximately 66.2 million shares were issued, and 65.2 million shares were outstanding as of December 31, 2019. Our board of directors has the authority to cause us to issue additional shares of common stock without consent of any of our stockholders. Consequently, the stockholders may experience more dilution in their ownership of our stock in the future.\nThe stock price of our common stock has been and likely will continue to be volatile and may decline in value regardless of our performance.\nThe market price for our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, many of which are outside our control, including those described above and the following:\n\u00b7\nour operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u00b7\nfuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including but not limited to shares we may issue as consideration for acquisitions or investments;\n\u00b7\nhousing and mortgage finance markets;\n\u00b7\nour quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u00b7\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u00b7\nchanges in recommendations or analysis of our prospects by securities analysts who track our common stock;\n\u00b7\nmarket and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy;\n\u00b7\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u00b7\nactual or potential changes in laws, regulations and regulatory interpretations, including as a result of the 2017 Tax Act;\n\u00b7\nchanges in interest rates;\n\u00b7\nchanges in demographics relating to housing such as household formation or other consumer preferences toward home ownership;\n\u00b7\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u00b7\narrival and departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nadverse resolution of new or pending litigation or regulatory proceedings against us; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced periods of high price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of the equity securities of many companies, including technology companies and real estate brokerages. Such price fluctuations can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and harm our business.\nBecause we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the near future, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them.\nWe intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the near future. The declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of the board of directors, and will depend upon, among other things, the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and other factors as the board of directors considers relevant. There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid, and if dividends are paid, there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend. Unless we pay dividends, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them.\nDelaware law and our organizational documents may impede or discourage a takeover, which could deprive our investors of the opportunity to receive a premium for their shares.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may make it more difficult for, or prevent a third party from, acquiring control of us without the approval of our Board of Directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u00b7\ndo not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u00b7\ndelegate the sole power to a majority of the Board of Directors to fix the number of directors;\n\u00b7\nprovide the power to our Board of Directors to fill any vacancy on our Board of Directors, whether such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise;\n\u00b7\neliminate the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u00b7\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nThe foregoing factors could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential investor from making a tender offer for our common stock which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market value of our common stock and our investors\u2019 ability to realize any potential change-in-control premium.", "PERMNO": 17812, "SIC": 6531, "TIC": "EXPI"}
