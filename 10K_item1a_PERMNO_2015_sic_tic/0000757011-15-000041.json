We have described below significant factors that may adversely affect our industry and our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. You should carefully consider these factors, together with all of the other information in this annual report on Form 10-K and in other documents that we file with the SEC, before making any investment decision about our securities. Adverse developments or changes related to any of the factors listed below could affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur business is cyclical in nature, and is particularly dependent on the housing and construction-based markets. Continued weakness, or future downturns or delays in the recovery of these markets, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur businesses are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including, in particular, conditions in the North American housing and construction-based markets. Housing starts and new nonresidential construction in the United States still remain low by historical standards. Further, the residential and non-residential repair and remodel market, which accounts for the largest portion of our sales, decreased over the prior year, following modest year over year increases, after years of substantial decline. Since January 2007, we permanently closed or temporarily idled certain of our highest cost gypsum wallboard, paper and other production facilities. We have recorded long-lived asset impairment charges aggregating approximately $175 million since January 2007 related to these closures and idled facilities. If our markets do not return to historic levels, or if they experience future downturns, additional material write-downs or impairment charges may be required in the future.\nWe cannot predict the duration of the current market conditions, or the timing or strength of any recovery of the housing and construction-based markets, which may depend on broader economic issues such as employment, the availability of credit, lending practices, interest rates, foreclosures, house price trends, availability of mortgage financing, income tax policy, and consumer confidence and preference. We also cannot provide any assurances that the housing and construction-based markets will continue to recover, or that further operational adjustments will not be required to address market conditions. Continued weakness, delays in recovery, or future downturns in the housing and construction-based markets may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nPrices for our products are affected by overall supply and demand in the markets for our products and our competitors\u2019 products. Market prices of building products historically have been volatile and cyclical. Currently, there is significant excess wallboard production capacity industry wide in the United States. Further, a majority of our businesses are seasonal, which has caused in the past, and will likely cause in the future, our quarterly results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter. A prolonged continuation of weak demand or excess supply in any of our businesses may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. We recently implemented a price increase for wallboard with the new price for January 1, 2015 through October 31, 2015. However, it is uncertain that we will be able to maintain the increase in our gypsum wallboard selling prices. If we are unable to maintain our price increases, our net sales and operating profit may be materially and adversely impacted.\nOur customers and suppliers are exposed to risks associated with economic and financial conditions that could adversely affect their payment of our invoices or the continuation of their businesses at the same level.\nThe businesses of many of our customers and suppliers are exposed to risks related to the current economic environment. A number of our customers and suppliers have been and may continue to be adversely affected by weak financial conditions in their markets, disruptions to the capital and credit markets and decreased demand for their products and services. In the event that any of our large customers or suppliers, or a significant number of smaller customers or suppliers, are adversely affected by these risks, we may face disruptions in supply, further reductions in demand for our products and services, failure of customers to pay invoices when due and other adverse effects that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur substantial indebtedness may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2014, we had $2.209 billion of total debt, consisting of senior notes, industrial revenue bonds and outstanding borrowings under our ship mortgage facility. Our substantial indebtedness may have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and operating results, including to:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt service obligations or refinance our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general operating requirements;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, debt service obligations and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from making strategic acquisitions, taking advantage of favorable business opportunities or executing our strategic priorities;\n\u2022\nplace us at a relative competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have proportionately less debt;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate, which may adversely affect our operating results and ability to meet our debt service obligations;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to the current and potentially more severe adverse general economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability, or increase the cost, to refinance our indebtedness.\nUnder the terms of our debt instruments, we are permitted to incur substantial additional indebtedness. If we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to our substantial indebtedness may intensify.\nWe require a significant amount of liquidity to service our indebtedness and fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, acquisitions and other corporate expenditures.\nOur ability to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, acquisitions and other corporate expenditures, including repayment of our indebtedness, depends on our ability to generate cash through future operating performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors. Many of these factors are beyond our control. We cannot ensure that our businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings or other financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other needs.\nWe are required to post letters of credit or cash as collateral primarily in connection with our hedging transactions, insurance programs and bonding activities. The amounts of collateral we are required to post may vary based on our financial position and credit ratings. Use of letters of credit as collateral reduces our borrowing availability under our domestic revolving credit agreement and, therefore, like the use of cash as collateral, reduces our overall liquidity and our ability to fund other business activities.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to fund our needs, we may need to pursue one or more alternatives, such as to:\n\u2022\ncurtail our operations;\n\u2022\nreduce or delay planned capital expenditures, research and development or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nseek additional financing or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness at or before maturity;\n\u2022\nsell assets or businesses; or\n\u2022\nsell additional equity.\nAny curtailment of operations, reduction or delay in planned capital expenditures, research and development or acquisitions, or any sales of assets or businesses, may materially and adversely affect our future revenue prospects. In addition, we cannot ensure that we will be able to raise additional equity capital, restructure or refinance any of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nWe face competition in each of our businesses. If we cannot effectively compete in the marketplace, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe face competition in each of our businesses. Principal methods of competition include quality and range of products, service, location, pricing, compatibility of systems and product design features. Actions of our competitors, or the entry of new competitors in our markets, could lead to lower pricing by us in an effort to maintain market share and could also lead to lower sales volumes. To achieve and/or maintain leadership positions in key product categories, we must continue to develop brand\nrecognition and loyalty, enhance product quality and performance, introduce new products and develop our manufacturing and distribution capabilities.\nWe also compete through our use and improvement of information technology. In order to remain competitive, we need to provide customers with timely, accurate, easy-to-access information about product availability, orders and delivery status using state-of-the-art systems. While we have provided manual processes for short-term failures and disaster recovery capability, a prolonged disruption of systems or other failure to meet customers\u2019 expectations regarding the capabilities and reliability of our systems may materially and adversely affect our operating results, particularly during any prolonged period of disruption.\nWe intend to continue making investments in research and development to develop new and improved products and more efficient production methods in order to maintain our market leadership position. If we do not make these investments, or our investments are not successful, our revenues, operating results and market share could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, there can be no assurance that revenue from new products or enhancements will be sufficient to recover the research and development expenses associated with their development.\nCertain of our customers have significant buying power, which may materially and adversely affect our revenues, financial condition and operating results.\nCertain of our important customers are large companies with significant buying power. In addition, potential further consolidation in our distribution channels could enhance the ability of certain of our customers to seek more favorable terms, including pricing, for the products that they purchase from us. Accordingly, our ability to maintain or raise prices in the future may be limited, including during periods of raw material and other cost increases. If we are forced to reduce prices or to maintain prices during periods of increased costs, or if we lose customers because of pricing or other methods of competition, our revenues, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe loss of sales to one or more of our major customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe face strong competition for our major customers. If one or more of our major customers reduces, delays or cancels substantial orders, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected, particularly for the period in which the reduction, delay or cancellation occurs and also possibly for subsequent periods.\nSignificant changes in discount rates used to measure our defined benefit plan obligations, actual investment returns on pension assets and other factors could negatively impact our operating results and cash flows.\nWe maintain defined benefit pension plans as well as other postretirement benefit plans for eligible employees. Our profit margins are affected by costs related to maintaining these plans for active employees and retirees. The recognition of costs and liabilities associated with these plans for financial reporting purposes is affected by the level of interest rates and assumptions made by management and used by actuaries engaged by us to calculate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations and the annual expense recognized for these plans. The assumptions used in developing the required estimates primarily include discount rates, expected return on plan assets for the funded plans, compensation increase rates, retirement rates, mortality rates and, for postretirement benefits, health care cost trend rates. Economic and market factors and conditions could affect any of these assumptions and may affect our estimated and actual employee benefit plan costs and our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur pension plans were underfunded by approximately $346 million as of December 31, 2014 and $114 million as of December 31, 2013. In recent years, the declining interest rates and changes to mortality assumptions have negatively impacted the funded status of our pension plans. The asset performance has been volatile since 2008, with plan assets outperforming in some years and underperforming in other years versus the assumed rate of return used to determine pension expense. If the discount rates and actual asset returns increase or decrease, the funded status of our plan as well as the future pension expense and funding obligations will decrease and increase, respectively.\nIf costs of key raw materials or energy increase, or the availability of key raw materials or energy decreases, our cost of products sold will increase and our operating results or cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe cost and availability of raw materials and energy are critical to our operations. For example, we use substantial quantities of gypsum, wastepaper, mineral fiber, steel, perlite and starch. The cost of certain of these items has been volatile, and availability has sometimes been limited. We obtain some of these materials from a limited number of suppliers, which increases the risk of unavailability. We may not be able to pass increased raw material prices on to our customers in the future if the market or\nexisting agreements with our customers do not allow us to raise the prices of our finished products. If price adjustments for our finished products significantly trail the increase in raw material prices, or if we cannot effectively hedge against price increases, our operating results or cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.\nApproximately half of the gypsum used in our wallboard plants is synthetic gypsum, which is a coal-combustion byproduct, or CCB, resulting primarily from flue gas desulphurization carried out by electric generation or industrial plants burning coal as a fuel. Six of our 19 gypsum wallboard plants in operation use synthetic gypsum for all of their needs, while another six use it for some of their needs. The suppliers of synthetic gypsum are primarily power companies, and certain power companies have recently switched to using natural gas instead of coal for their electric generation needs. In the event more power companies switch to using natural gas instead of coal, the availability of synthetic gypsum may decrease. Further, although the U.S. EPA issued a final rule in December 2014 providing that there are no additional regulatory requirements on the use of synthetic gypsum, legal challenges to this final rule, or subsequent state legislation, could result in laws or regulations that adversely affect the classification, use, storage and disposal of synthetic gypsum, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nEnergy costs also are affected by various market factors, including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions. Prices for natural gas and electrical power, which are significant components of the costs associated with production of our gypsum and interior systems products, have been volatile in recent years. There may be substantial increases in the price, or a decline in the availability, of energy in the future, especially in light of instability or possible dislocations in some energy markets.\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC has promulgated rules regarding disclosure of the presence in a company\u2019s products of certain metals, known as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d which are metals mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries, as well as procedures regarding a manufacturer\u2019s efforts to identify the sourcing of those minerals from this region. Complying with these rules requires investigative efforts, which has and will continue to cause us to incur associated costs, and could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products, or result in process or manufacturing modifications, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nFluctuations in the market price of natural gas may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe use natural gas extensively in the production of gypsum and interior systems products in the United States, Canada and Mexico. As a result, our profitability and cash flows can be highly dependent on the price of natural gas, which historically has been very volatile and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control. We are not always able to pass on increases in energy costs to our customers through increases in product prices.\nIn an attempt to reduce our price risk related to fluctuations in natural gas prices, we enter into hedging agreements using swaps. We benefit from the hedge agreements when spot prices exceed contractually specified prices. We are disadvantaged by the hedge agreements when spot prices are less than contractually specified prices.\nIn addition, the results of our hedging agreements could be negative in any period depending on price changes in the hedged exposures. Further, changes to the price of natural gas, including as a result of environmental or other legislation, could result in changes to the value of our hedging contracts, which could impact our results of operations for a particular period. Our hedging activities are not designed to mitigate long-term natural gas price fluctuations and, therefore, will not protect us from long-term natural gas price increases.\nAny substantial or extended decline in prices of, or demand for, natural gas that has been hedged could cause our production costs to be greater than those of our competitors. A significant production cost differential could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur exposure to the risks of operating internationally could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nInternational business operations, including through UBBP, and our operations in Canada, Mexico, and Latin America, are becoming increasingly important to our future operations, growth and prospects. Further, it is a strategic priority of ours to continue to grow and diversify our earnings by expanding in select emerging markets. Our foreign operations and our international expansion strategy are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\ncompliance with United States laws affecting operations outside of the United States, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar anti-bribery laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ncompliance with a variety of local regulations and laws;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws and the interpretation of those laws;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency values;\n\u2022\nsudden changes in foreign currency exchange controls;\n\u2022\ndiscriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ngreater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles;\n\u2022\neffective and immediate implementation of control environment processes across our diverse operations and employee base;\n\u2022\nnationalization of properties by foreign governments; and\n\u2022\nimposition of more or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, and similar restrictions on our sales outside the United States.\nMoreover, political and economic changes or volatility, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, epidemics, including the Ebola epidemic, public corruption and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations. All of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nUSG Boral Building Products reduces our control over certain of our assets and could give rise to disputes with Boral that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nUBBP involves risks not otherwise present when we operate our business through wholly-owned entities. For example:\n\u2022\nCertain major decisions with respect to UBBP require the majority or unanimous approval of the joint ventures\u2019 boards or shareholders. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain approval of certain matters that would be in our best interests.\n\u2022\nA deadlock with respect to certain fundamental decisions may result in the triggering of a sale process of UBBP. In such a case, the terms of the sale may be less attractive than if we had held onto our investments.\n\u2022\nUBBP is operated in accordance with the terms of a shareholders agreement (the \"Shareholders Agreement\") that limits our ability to transfer our interest in UBBP. As a result, we may be unable to sell our interest in UBBP when we would otherwise like.\n\u2022\nUBBP may not pay dividends if such payments are, among other things, restricted pursuant to the terms of the credit facilities maintained by UBBP, inconsistent with the then-applicable strategic plan, or illegal. Accordingly, we may not receive dividend payments from UBBP in the amounts that we currently anticipate or at all, which may adversely impact our ability to receive any economic benefit from UBBP.\n\u2022\nIf we or Boral, or certain of our respective affiliates, are subject to a change of control, or if certain other events of default under the Shareholders Agreement occur with respect to us or Boral, we or Boral, as applicable, may be required to sell our or Boral's, as applicable, entire interest in UBBP at fair market value, as determined in accordance with the Shareholders Agreement. In the event we are forced to sell our interest in UBBP, it may be under terms that are not advantageous to us. In the event Boral is forced to sell its interest in UBBP, and we are unable to acquire Boral's interest due to lack of funding or otherwise, we would not have the right to select the third party to which Boral would sell its interest.\n\u2022\nWe have provided unconditional and irrevocable guarantees of the obligations of our subsidiaries under two share sale and subscription agreements and the Shareholders Agreement (together, the \u201cJoint Venture Agreements\u201d) and have agreed to indemnify Boral and its subsidiaries for all losses, actions, proceedings and judgments resulting from any default or delay in performance by our subsidiaries thereunder. Any such payments may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\u2022\nIn certain circumstances, a capital call may be issued to the shareholders of UBBP in order to obtain additional funding for the joint ventures' operations. If we do not provide capital and Boral does, Boral may receive additional shares in UBBP, thereby diluting our interest and impairing our rights under the Shareholders Agreement.\n\u2022\nBoral may become insolvent, refuse to make additional capital contributions or fail to meet its obligations under the Joint Venture Agreements, which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments.\n\u2022\nBoral may have economic or other business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our interests or goals, or we may become engaged in a dispute with Boral that could require us to spend additional resources to resolve such dispute and have an adverse impact on the operations and profitability of UBBP.\n\u2022\nIn the event we exit UBBP, we may be restricted from competing in certain markets, many of which we anticipate to be high-growth markets, until the later of the third anniversary of our exit and ten years from the commencement of UBBP.\nIf any of these risks were to materialize, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nOur business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected by infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of contractual rights, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. We also maintain patents for certain of our technologies. We customarily require our employees and independent contractors to execute confidentiality agreements or otherwise to agree to keep our proprietary information confidential when their relationship with us begins. In addition, we have entered into certain contractual intellectual property protections in connection with the licensure and use of our intellectual property by UBBP.\nDespite our efforts, the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate. Existing trade secret, patent, trademark and copyright laws offer only limited protection. Our patents could be invalidated or circumvented. In addition, others may develop substantially equivalent or superseding proprietary technology, or competitors may offer similar competing products that do not infringe on our intellectual property rights, thereby substantially reducing the value of our proprietary rights.\nMoreover, the laws of some foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. This risk may be heightened in connection with our investments in UBBP, because it results in the use of our intellectual property in additional foreign jurisdictions, some of which lack robust or accessible intellectual property protection enforcement mechanisms.\nFrom time to time, litigation may be necessary to defend and enforce our proprietary rights. As a result, we could incur substantial costs and divert management resources, which could harm our business, regardless of the final outcome. Despite our efforts to safeguard and maintain our intellectual property rights, both in the United States and abroad, we may be unsuccessful in doing so, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nA security breach of customer, employee, supplier or company information may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn the conduct of our business we collect, use, transmit and store data on information systems, which are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. Any security breach or compromise of our information systems could significantly damage our reputation, cause the disclosure of confidential customer, employee, supplier or company information, including our intellectual property, and result in significant losses, litigation, fines and costs. While we have implemented processes to protect against unauthorized access to our information systems and data, there is no guarantee that these procedures are adequate or will be able to prevent breaches. The regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and privacy is evolving, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs.\nCovenant restrictions under the agreements governing our indebtedness may limit our ability to pursue business activities or otherwise operate our business.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants that may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities, including, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends\n\u2022\nmake guarantees;\n\u2022\nsell assets or make other fundamental changes;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nchange our business purposes; and\n\u2022\nenter into sale and lease-back transactions.\nIn addition, we are subject to agreements that may require us to meet and maintain certain financial ratios and tests, which may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our current or future business plans. General business and economic conditions may affect our ability to comply with these covenants or meet those financial ratios and tests.\nA breach of any of our credit agreement or indenture covenants or failure to maintain a required ratio or meet a required test may result in an event of default under those agreements. This may allow the counterparties to those agreements to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this occurs, we may not be able to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all, or repay the accelerated indebtedness.\nWe are subject to environmental and safety laws and regulations that may change. These laws and regulations could cause us to make modifications to how we manufacture and price our products. They could also require that we make significant capital investments or otherwise increase our costs.\nWe are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and occupational health and safety, including laws regulating air emissions, wastewater discharges, the management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, and the health and safety of our employees. We are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain operations. If we were to fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could incur fines, penalties or other sanctions. In addition, we could be held responsible for costs and damages arising from any contamination at our past or present facilities or at third-party waste disposal sites. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials. Environmental laws and regulations tend to become more stringent over time, and we could incur material expenses relating to compliance with future environmental laws. Further, new environmental and safety legislation may have a material and adverse impact on our operations and results. For example, although the U.S. EPA issued a final rule in December 2014 providing that there are no additional regulatory requirements on the use of synthetic gypsum, one of our primary raw materials, legal challenges to this final rule, or subsequent state legislation, could result in laws or regulations that adversely affect the classification, use, storage and disposal of synthetic gypsum, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. In addition, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has proposed a comprehensive occupational health standard for crystalline silica which would, among other things, lower the permissible occupational exposure limits. We could incur substantial costs in connection with complying with this rule as proposed.\nThe price and availability of certain of the raw materials that we use may vary in the future as a result of environmental laws and regulations affecting our suppliers. An increase in the price of our raw materials, a decline in their availability or future costs relating to our compliance with environmental laws and regulations may materially and adversely affect our operating margins or result in reduced demand for our products.\nThe U.S. Congress, several states and the international community are considering measures to reduce emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs), including carbon dioxide and methane. Some states and provinces have already adopted greenhouse gas regulation or legislation. Following a finding by the U.S. EPA that certain GHGs represent an endangerment to human health, the U.S. EPA adopted two sets of rules regulating GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act, one that requires a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and another that regulates emissions of GHGs from certain large stationary sources. These rules, if they withstand legal challenge, could affect all of our U.S. wallboard and ceiling tile plants and paper mills and would require that we incur significant costs to satisfy permitting requirements. In addition, enactment of new climate control legislation, regulatory initiatives or treaties impacting the locations where we conduct business could have a materially adverse effect on our operations and demand for our services or products. For example, any new legislation, such as a \u201ccarbon tax\u201d on energy use or establishing a \u201ccap and trade\u201d, could materially and adversely increase the cost of energy used in our manufacturing processes. If energy becomes more expensive, we may not be able to pass these increased costs on to purchasers of our products. Further, stricter regulation of emissions might require us to install emissions controls or other equipment at some or all of our manufacturing facilities, requiring significant additional capital investments.\nWe may pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and other transactions that complement or expand our businesses. We may not be able to complete proposed transactions, and even if completed, the transactions may involve a number of risks that may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nAs business conditions warrant and our financial resources permit, we may pursue opportunities to acquire businesses or technologies and to form joint ventures that we believe could complement, enhance or expand our current businesses or product lines or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. We may have difficulty identifying appropriate opportunities, or if we do identify opportunities, we may not be successful in completing transactions for a number of reasons. Any transactions that we are able to identify and complete, including UBBP, may involve one or more of a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from our existing businesses to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired business or joint venture;\n\u2022\npossible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process;\n\u2022\nfailure of the acquired business or joint venture to achieve expected operational, profitability and investment return objectives;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of significant charges, such as asset devaluation or restructuring charges;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of unanticipated liabilities and costs for which indemnification is unavailable or inadequate; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to achieve other intended objectives of the transaction.\nIn addition, we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage our newly acquired operations or their employees. We may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, which may lead to operational inefficiencies. In addition, future acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of additional indebtedness.\nOur financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings, including those involving antitrust, tax, environmental, or other matters.\nWe are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future, some of which could be material. The outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation and similar disputes are often difficult to predict reliably. Various factors and developments can lead to changes in current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables, where applicable, or make additional estimates, including new or modified estimates that may be appropriate due to a judicial ruling or judgment, a settlement, regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period. For a more detailed discussion of certain of the legal proceedings in which we are involved, see Item 3, Legal Proceedings, below.\nIf we experience an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code, utilization of our net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation.\nThe Internal Revenue Code imposes limitations on a corporation\u2019s ability to utilize NOLs to reduce its federal income taxes if it experiences an \u201cownership change.\u201d In general terms, an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three-year period. If we were to experience an ownership change, utilization of our NOLs would be subject to an annual limitation determined by multiplying the market value of our outstanding shares of stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate (which was 2.80% for December 2014). Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years within the allowed NOL carryforward period. The amount of the limitation may, under certain circumstances, be increased or decreased by built-in gains or losses held by us at the time of the change that are recognized in the five-year period after the change. Many states have similar limitations. If an ownership change had occurred as of December 31, 2014, our annual U.S. federal NOL utilization would have been limited to approximately $113 million per year.\nWe may use our NOL carryforwards to offset future earnings and reduce our federal income tax liability. As a result, we believe these NOL carryforwards are a substantial asset for us. We have a stockholder rights plan, or the Rights Agreement, in place to protect our stockholders from coercive takeover practices or takeover bids that are inconsistent with their best interests. On March 22, 2013 and February 11, 2015, our board of directors approved amendments to the Rights Agreement in an effort to protect our NOLs. In addition, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation includes an amendment, the Protective Amendment, that restricts certain transfers of our common stock. The Protective Amendment is intended to protect the tax benefits of our\nNOLs. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a description of the amendment to the Rights Agreement and the Protective Amendment. Although the amendment to the Rights Agreement and Protective Amendment are intended to reduce the likelihood of an \u201cownership change\u201d that could adversely affect us, we cannot provide assurance that the restrictions on transferability in the amendment to the Rights Agreement and Protective Amendment will prevent all transfers that could result in such an \u201cownership change.\u201d There also can be no assurance that the transfer restrictions in the Protective Amendment will be enforceable against all of our shareholders absent a court determination confirming such enforceability. The transfer restrictions may be subject to challenge on legal or equitable grounds.\nA small number of our stockholders could significantly influence our business, affairs and stock price.\nBased on filings made with the SEC and other information available to us, we believe that, as of January 31, 2015, two stockholders collectively controlled over 40% of our common stock. Accordingly, a small number of our stockholders could affect matters requiring approval by stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of potential business combination transactions. In addition, if one or more of these stockholders sell a large number of our shares, our share price may decline, and could then continue to trade at lower prices.\nWe have outsourced certain corporate and operational functions, which makes us more dependent on third parties.\nWe have outsourced certain elements of our corporate and operational functions, including certain elements of our finance, accounting and information technology functions, to third party service providers, some of whom operate outside of the United States. We may outsource additional functions in the future. As a result, we rely on third parties to ensure that these functions are sufficiently performed. This reliance subjects us to risks arising from the loss of control over certain processes, changes in pricing that may affect our operating results, and the termination of provision of these services by our suppliers. A failure of our service providers to satisfactorily perform these functions may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nOur continuing efforts to return to historic levels of profitability by reducing costs may not result in the anticipated savings in operating costs.\nWe have implemented various cost reduction programs to lower our breakeven and return to historic levels of profitability, including plant and distribution branch closures, workforce reductions, outsourcing of corporate and operational function and Lean Six Sigma initiatives. We may implement additional programs in the future. These cost reduction programs may not produce anticipated results. Our ability to achieve cost savings and other benefits within expected time frames is subject to many estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we experience delays, if anticipated market recovery does not occur, or if other unforeseen events occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nWe do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe have not paid a dividend on our common stock since the first quarter of 2001 and have no plans to do so in the foreseeable future. Further, our credit agreement limits our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our stock unless specified borrowing availability and fixed charge coverage ratio tests are met, and it prohibits payment of a dividend if a default exists under the agreement. Because we do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, investors in our common stock will have to rely on the possibility of stock appreciation for a return on their investment.", "PERMNO": 79244, "SIC": 3270, "TIC": "USG"}
