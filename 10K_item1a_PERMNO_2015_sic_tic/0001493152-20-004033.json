{"cik": "946454", "company": "BALLANTYNE STRONG, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business and financial performance are subject to various risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. We discuss in this section some of the risk factors that, if they actually occurred, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose part or all of your investment. You should consider these risk factors in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect subsequent events or circumstances or the occurrence of unanticipated events.\nIf we are unable to expand our revenue streams to compensate for the lower demand for our digital cinema products and installation services, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nA significant portion of our revenue in recent years has been generated from the theater exhibition industry\u2019s need for digital cinema equipment and services to support the industry\u2019s transformation from film to digital equipment. This transition required us to commit substantial resources to the process of retrofitting existing theater complexes by removing the film equipment and replacing it with digital equipment, and we experienced significant financial gains from this work. With the completion of this digital conversion by North America theater exhibitors, we are no longer able to rely on that income as a major source of our earnings. If we are unable to expand our revenue streams with other products and services, our future growth would be significantly curtailed.\nInterruptions of, or higher prices of, components from our suppliers may affect our results of operations and financial performance.\nA portion of our revenues are dependent on the distribution of products supplied by various key suppliers. If we fail to maintain satisfactory relationships with our suppliers, or if our suppliers experience significant financial difficulties, we could experience difficulty in obtaining needed goods and services. Some suppliers could also decide to reduce inventories or raise prices to increase cash flow. The loss of any one or more of our suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business, and we may be unable to secure alternative manufacturing arrangements. Even if we are able to obtain alternative manufacturing arrangements, such arrangements may not be on terms similar to our current arrangements or we may be forced to accept less favorable terms in order to secure a supplier as quickly as possible so as to minimize the impact on our business operations. In addition, any required changes in our suppliers could cause delays in our operations and increase our production costs and new suppliers may not be able to meet our production demands as to volume, quality or timeliness.\nThe markets for our products and services are highly competitive and if market share is lost, we may be unable to lower our cost structure quickly enough to offset the loss of revenue.\nWithin the Strong Entertainment business, the domestic and international markets for our product lines are highly competitive, evolving and subject to rapid technological and other changes. Our Convergent and Strong Outdoor businesses, in particular, are highly dependent on technology. We expect the intensity of competition in each of these areas to continue in the future for a number of reasons including:\n\u25cf Certain of the competitors for our digital equipment have longer operating histories and greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do, which, among other things, may permit them to adopt aggressive pricing policies. As a result, we may suffer from pricing pressures that could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and our results of operations. Some of our competitors also have greater name and brand recognition and a larger customer base than us.\n\u25cf Some of our competitors are manufacturing their own digital equipment while we employ a distribution business model through our distribution agreements with NEC, Barco and certain other suppliers. As a result, we may suffer from pricing pressures that could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues.\n\u25cf Suppliers could decide to utilize their current sales force to supply their products directly to customers rather than utilizing channels.\nIn addition, we face competition for consumer attention from other forms of entertainment. The other forms of entertainment may be more attractive to consumers than those utilizing our technologies, which could harm our business, prospects and operating results.\nOur Strong Outdoor business also provides advertising services on taxicabs in New York City on vinyl printed signs and has begun to expand into experiential marketing. Certain competitors have substantially more experience in these markets than we do and may be better positioned to adapt to new technologies or changes in the markets for such services or to provide such services at lower rates. In addition, our experiential marketing initiatives may not acquire market acceptance, or we may be unable to provide such services in a cost-effective manner, if at all. We may also be unable to successfully pursue expansion of such services beyond New York City.\nFor these and other reasons, we must continue to enhance our technologies and our existing products and services and introduce new high-quality technologies, products and services to meet the wide variety of competitive pressures that we face. If we are unable to compete successfully, our business, prospects and results of operations will be materially adversely impacted.\nOur capital allocation strategy may not be successful, which could adversely impact our financial condition.\nWe intend to continue investing part of our cash balances in public companies. We intend our investments in public companies to be made in circumstances where we believe that we will be able to exercise some degree of influence or control. Currently, our investments are highly concentrated in two public companies, PIH and Itasca, and one private company, Firefly. In some cases, funds controlled by our affiliate Fundamental Global Investors have, and may in the future, acquire positions in the same public companies as us. We may also invest in private companies or other areas, including acquisitions of businesses. These types of investments are riskier than holding our cash balances as bank deposits or, for example, such conservative investments as treasury bonds or money market funds. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or enhance the value or the performance of the companies in which we have invested or may invest in the future, or that we will achieve returns or benefits from these investments. Under certain circumstances, significant declines in the fair values of these investments may require the recognition of other-than-temporary impairment losses. We may lose all or part of our investment relating to such companies if their value decreases as a result of their financial performance or for any other reason. If our interests differ from those of other investors in companies over which we do not have control, we may be unable to effect any change at those companies. We are not required to meet any diversification standards, and our investments may continue to remain concentrated. In addition, we may seek to sell some or all of our existing businesses as part of our holding company strategy.\nIf our capital allocation strategy is not successful or we achieve less than expected returns from these investments, it could have a material adverse effect on us. The Board of Directors may also change our capital allocation strategy at any time, and such changes could further increase our exposure, which could adversely impact us.\nIf we are not able to develop and introduce enhancements and new features that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with technological developments, our business could be harmed.\nWe operate in a dynamic environment characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry and legal standards. Innovation is critical to our success. The introduction of new software solutions by our competitors, the market acceptance of solutions based on new or alternative technologies or the emergence of new industry standards could render our platform obsolete. Our ability to compete successfully, attract new customers and increase revenues from existing customers depends in part on our ability to enhance and improve our existing software platform and to identify new software partners, which would allow us to continually introduce or acquire new features that are in demand by the markets that we serve. The success of any enhancement or new solution depends on several factors, including timely completion and integration, adequate quality testing, introduction and market acceptance. Any new platform or feature that we develop or acquire may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner, may contain defects or may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenues. If we are unable to anticipate, or timely and successfully develop or acquire, new offerings or features, or enhance our existing platform to meet customer requirements, our business and operating results will be adversely affected. Additionally, for technologies that are acquired, we may not be able to successfully integrate or monetize the acquired technology at a rate that is consistent with the market\u2019s expectations, which could have a material adverse impact on us.\nIf we are unable to maintain our brand and reputation, our business, results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed.\nOur business, results of operations and prospects depend, in part, on maintaining and strengthening our brand and reputation for providing high quality products and services. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions. Although reputations may take decades to build, any negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation. If problems with our products cause operational disruption or other difficulties, or there are delays or other issues with the delivery of our products or services, our brand and reputation could be diminished. Damage to our reputation could also arise from actual or perceived legal violations, product safety issues, data security breaches, actual or perceived poor employee relations, actual or perceived poor service, actual or perceived poor privacy practices, operational or sustainability issues, actual or perceived ethical issues or other events within or outside of our control that generate negative publicity with respect to us. Any event that has the potential to negatively impact our reputation could lead to lost sales, loss of new opportunities and retention and recruiting difficulties. If we fail to promote and maintain our brand and reputation successfully, our business, results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed.\nOur sales cycle can be long and unpredictable, particularly with respect to large enterprises, which could harm our business and operating results.\nThe timing of our sales is difficult to predict. Our sales efforts involve educating our customers, frequently at an executive level, about the use, potential return on investment, technical capabilities, security and other benefits of our solution. Customers often undertake a prolonged product-evaluation process, which frequently involves not only our solutions but also those of our competitors. As we continue to target our sales efforts at large enterprise customers, we will face greater costs, long sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. In this market segment, the customer\u2019s decision to subscribe to our solution is often an enterprise-wide decision and may require us to provide even greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our solution and obtain support from multiple departments. In addition, prospective enterprise customers may require customized features and functions unique to their business process that may need acceptance testing related to those unique features. As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support, operational support and professional services resources to individual customers, increasing costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions. The long and unpredictable nature of our sales cycle could materially adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe are substantially dependent upon significant customers who could cease purchasing our products at any time.\nOur top ten customers accounted for approximately 47% of 2019 consolidated net revenues. Trade accounts receivable from these customers represented approximately 41% of net consolidated receivables at December 31, 2019. Most arrangements with these customers are made by purchase order and are terminable at will by either party. A significant decrease or interruption in business from our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to the economic and political risks of selling products in foreign countries.\nSales outside the United States (mainly Strong Entertainment) accounted for approximately 16% of consolidated sales in fiscal 2019. We expect that international sales will continue to be important to our business for the foreseeable future. Foreign sales are subject to general political and economic risks, including the adverse impact of changes to international trade and tariff policies, including in the U.S. and China, which have created uncertainty regarding international trade, unanticipated or unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations, unfavorable changes in U.S. policies on international trade and investment, the imposition of governmental economic sanctions on countries in which we do business, quotas, capital controls or other trade barriers, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocks, threats of war, terrorism or governmental instability, currency controls, fluctuating exchange rates with respect to sales not denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in import/export regulations, tariffs and freight rates, potential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies, restrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of a country and the disruption of operations from labor, political and other disturbances, such as the impact of the coronavirus and other public health epidemics or pandemics. Government policies on international trade and investment can affect the demand for our products, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell or manufacture products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, a government\u2019s adoption of \u201cbuy national\u201d policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations. If we were unable to navigate the foreign regulatory environment, or if we were unable to enforce our contract rights in foreign countries, our business could be adversely impacted. Any of these events could reduce our sales, limit the prices at which we can sell our products, interrupt our supply chain or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating performance.\nIn addition, a portion of our foreign sales are denominated in foreign currencies and amounted to $3.5 million in 2019. To the extent that orders are denominated in foreign currencies, our reported sales and earnings are subject to foreign exchange fluctuations. In addition, there can be no assurance that our remaining international customers will continue to accept orders denominated in U.S. dollars. For those sales which are denominated in U.S. dollars, a weakening in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse impact on us by increasing the effective price of our products in international markets. Certain areas of the world are also more cost conscious than the U.S. market and there are instances where our products are priced higher than local manufacturers. We are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations between the Canadian and U.S. dollar due to our screen manufacturing facility in Canada where a majority of its sales are denominated in the U.S. dollar while its expenses are denominated in Canadian currency. We cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved, the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates.\nAny of these factors could adversely affect our foreign activities and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe risk of non-compliance with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our international operations could have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial condition and strategic objectives.\nOur global operations subject us to regulation by U.S. federal and state laws and multiple foreign laws, regulations and policies, which could result in conflicting legal requirements. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time and increase our cost of doing business. These laws and regulations include import and export control, environmental, health and safety regulations, data privacy requirements, international labor laws and work councils and anti-corruption and bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.N. Convention Against Bribery and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials. We are subject to the risk that we, our employees, our affiliated entities, contractors, agents or their respective officers, directors, employees and agents may take action determined to be in violation of any of these laws. An actual or alleged violation could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil or criminal penalties, debarment from government contracts, curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, competitive or reputational harm, litigation or regulatory action and other consequences that might adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and strategic objectives.\nWe may become subject to additional sales tax collection obligations and claims for uncollected amounts.\nThe application of sales tax and other indirect taxes on cross border sales by remote sellers is continuing to change and evolve. In June 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court decided South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., a case challenging the prior law under which sellers were not required to collect sales and use tax unless they had a physical presence in the buyer\u2019s state. This decision will now allow states to adopt new or enforce existing laws requiring sellers to collect and remit sales and use tax, even in states in which the seller has no presence. The adoption or enforcement of any such legislation could result in additional sales and use tax collection responsibility for certain of our businesses. A number of states have already begun, or have positioned themselves to begin, requiring sales and use tax collection by remote sellers. We are in the process of determining how and when our collection practices may need to change in the relevant jurisdictions. It is possible that one or more jurisdictions may assert that we have liability for periods for which certain of our businesses have not collected sales, use or other similar taxes, and if such an assertion or assertions were successful, it could result in tax liabilities, including for past sales taxes and penalties and interest, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nA reversal of the U.S. economic recovery and a return to volatile or recessionary conditions in the United States or abroad could adversely affect our business or our access to capital markets in a material manner.\nWorsening economic and market conditions, downside shocks, or a return to recessionary economic conditions could serve to reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our operating results. These economic conditions may also impact the financial condition of one or more of our key suppliers, which could affect our ability to secure product to meet our customers\u2019 demand. In addition, a downturn in the cinema market could impact the valuation and collectability of certain long-term receivables held by us. Our results of operations and the implementation of our business strategy could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy, including conditions that are outside of our control, such as the impact of health and safety concerns from the current outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus. The most recent global financial crisis caused by the coronavirus resulted in extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to our business and could have a material adverse effect on us. We could also be adversely affected by such factors as changes in foreign currency rates and weak economic and political conditions in each of the countries in which we sell our products.\nWe rely extensively on our information technology systems and are vulnerable to damage and interruption.\nWe rely on our information technology systems and infrastructure to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business, including maintaining client and supplier information. Additionally, we utilize third parties, including cloud providers, to store, transfer and process data. From time to time, we experience cyber-attacks on our information technology systems. Our information technology systems, as well as the systems of our customers, suppliers and other partners, whose systems we do not control, are vulnerable to outages and an increasing risk of continually evolving deliberate intrusions to gain access to company sensitive information. Likewise, data security incidents and breaches by employees and others with or without permitted access to our systems pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. A cyber-attack or other significant disruption involving our information technology systems, or those of our customers, suppliers and other partners, could also result in disruptions in critical systems, corruption or loss of data and theft of data, funds or intellectual property. We may be unable to prevent outages or security breaches in our systems. We remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or yet unknown threats as, in some instances, we, our suppliers and our other partners may be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. We also face the risk that we expose our customers or partners to cybersecurity attacks. Any or all of the foregoing could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows, as well as our business reputation.\nAny failure to maintain the security of information relating to our customers, employees and suppliers, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise, could expose us to litigation, government enforcement actions and costly response measures, and could disrupt our operations and harm our reputation.\nIn connection with the sales and marketing of our products and services, we may from time to time transmit confidential information. We also have access to, collect or maintain private or confidential information regarding our customers, employees, and suppliers, as well as our business. Cyberattacks are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated. It is possible that computer hackers and others might compromise our security measures, or security measures of those parties that we do business with now or in the future, and obtain the personal information of our customers, employees and suppliers or our business information. A security breach of any kind, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and attacks by hackers, employees or others, could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation, government enforcement actions, regulatory penalties and costly response measures, and could seriously disrupt our operations. Any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation, which could cause us to lose market share and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf we fail to retain key members of management, or successfully integrate new executives, our business may be materially harmed.\nOur future success depends, in substantial part, on the efforts and abilities of our current management team. If certain of these individuals were to leave unexpectedly, we could experience substantial loss of institutional knowledge, face difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss in productivity while any successor obtains the necessary training and experience. Our loss of services of any of our senior executives, or any failure to effectively integrate new management into our business processes, controls, systems and culture, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe have made changes to our management team in recent years, which could create uncertainty among our employees, suppliers and other business partners and result in changes to the strategic direction of our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur previous and any potential future acquisitions, strategic investments, entry into new lines of business, divestitures, mergers or joint ventures may subject us to significant risks, any of which could harm our business.\nOur long-term strategy may include identifying and acquiring, investing in or merging with suitable candidates on acceptable terms, entry into new lines of business and markets or divesting of certain business lines or activities. In particular, over time, we may acquire, make investments in or merge with providers of product offerings that complement our business or may terminate such activities. Mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and entries into new lines of business include a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf diversion of management attention from running our existing business;\n\u25cf possible material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting;\n\u25cf increased expenses including legal, administrative and compensation expenses related to newly hired or terminated employees;\n\u25cf increased costs to integrate, develop or, in the case of a divestiture, separate the technology, personnel, customer base and business practices of the acquired, new or divested business or assets;\n\u25cf potential exposure to material liabilities not discovered in the due diligence process;\n\u25cf potential adverse effects on reported operating results due to possible write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with acquisitions;\n\u25cf potential damage to customer relationships or loss of synergies in the case of divestitures; and\n\u25cf unavailability of acquisition financing or inability to obtain such financing on reasonable terms.\nAny acquired business, technology, service or product or entry into a new line of business could significantly under-perform relative to our expectations, and may not achieve the benefits we expect. For all these reasons, our pursuit of an acquisition, investment, new line of business, divestiture, merger or joint venture could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.\nFailure to effectively utilize or successfully assert intellectual property rights could negatively impact us.\nWe own or otherwise have rights to various trademarks and trade names used in conjunction with the sale of our products, the most significant of which are Strong\u00ae and Convergent\u2122. We rely on trademark laws to protect these intellectual property rights. We cannot assure that these intellectual property rights will be effectively utilized or, if necessary, successfully asserted. There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own intellectual property rights, or, where appropriate, license from others, intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions. Our intellectual property rights, and any additional rights we may obtain in the future, may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged in the future. Our failure to perfect or successfully assert intellectual property rights could harm our competitive position and could negatively impact us.\nNatural disasters and other catastrophic events beyond our control could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance.\nThe occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as fires, hurricanes, tornados, tsunamis, floods and earthquakes; geo-political events, such as civil unrest in a country in which our suppliers are located or terrorist or military activities disrupting transportation, communication or utility systems; or other highly disruptive events, such as nuclear accidents, public health epidemics or pandemics, such as the ongoing coronavirus outbreak emanating from China, the impact of which is uncertain and which, if it persists for an extended period of time, could disrupt our global supply chain and result in significant expenses or delays outside of our control, or pandemics, unusual weather conditions or cyberattacks, could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. For example, the recent coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak in China has impacted and could further impact our operations, customers and suppliers in China and potentially in other geographies as a result of quarantines, facility closures, and travel and logistics restrictions in connection with the outbreak. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, and include the duration, severity and scope of the outbreak and the actions taken to contain or treat the coronavirus outbreak. In addition, temporary cinema closures in domestic and foreign markets and delays to movie release schedules may potentially negatively impact our customers\u2019 operations and timing of orders. Further, adverse events such as health-related concerns about working in our offices, the inability to travel and other matters affecting the general work environment could harm our business. In the event of a major disruption caused by the outbreak of epidemics or pandemic diseases such as coronavirus, we may lose the services of our employees or experience system interruptions, which could lead to diminishment of our business operations. Such events could result, among other things, in operational disruptions, physical damage to or destruction or disruption of one or more of our properties or properties used by third parties in connection with the supply of products or services to us, the lack of an adequate workforce in parts or all of our operations and communications and transportation disruptions. We cannot anticipate all the ways in which the current global health crisis and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business. These factors could also cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States and global financial markets and economy. Such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on us and could also have indirect consequences such as increases in the costs of insurance if they result in significant loss of property or other insurable damage.\nThe insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures.\nWe maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered. We are potentially at risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail. Additionally, severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers. In the future, we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels, and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain.\nEntities affiliated with Fundamental Global Investors, LLC, whose interests may differ from the interests of our other stockholders, have significant influence over us.\nThe interests of Fundamental Global Investors and its affiliates (\u201cFundamental Global Investors\u201d) may differ from the interests of our other stockholders. Fundamental Global Investors and its affiliates hold approximately 39.9% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of March 1, 2020. Mr. Cerminara, the Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder and Partner of Fundamental Global Investors, serves as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. In addition, Lewis M. Johnson, the President, Co-Founder and Partner of Fundamental Global Investors, serves as Co-Chairman of our Board of Directors. As a result of its ownership position and Mr. Cerminara\u2019s and Mr. Johnson\u2019s positions with the Company, Fundamental Global Investors has the ability to exert significant influence over our policies and affairs, including the power to impact the election of our directors, appointment of our management and approval of any action requiring a shareholder vote, such as amendments to our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, significant stock issuances, mergers and asset sales. Fundamental Global Investors may have interests that differ from those of our other stockholders and may vote in a way with which our other stockholders disagree and which may be adverse to their interests. Fundamental Global Investors\u2019 significant ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of the Company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the Company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur stock price is vulnerable to significant fluctuations.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile in the past and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results, general conditions in the industries in which we operate and other factors. In addition, the stock market is subject to price and volume fluctuations affecting the market price for the stock of many companies generally, which fluctuations often are unrelated to operating performance.", "PERMNO": 82234, "SIC": 3861, "TIC": "BTN"}
