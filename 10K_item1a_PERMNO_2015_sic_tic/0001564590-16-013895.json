{"cik": "877422", "company": "SpartanNash Co", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors\nThe Company faces many risks. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur, the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations may suffer, and the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline. This discussion of risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All of these forward-looking statements are affected by the risk factors discussed in this item and this discussion of risk factors should be read in conjunction with the discussion of forward-looking statements, which appears at the beginning of this report.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nThe Company operates in an extremely competitive industry. Many of its competitors are much larger than the Company and may be able to compete more effectively.\nThe Military segment faces competition from large national and regional food distributors as well as smaller distributors. Due to the narrow margins in the military food distribution industry, it is of critical importance for distributors to achieve economies of scale, which are typically a function of the density or concentration of military bases in the geographic area(s) a distributor serves and a distributor\u2019s share of that geographic area. As a result, no single distributor in this industry, by itself, has a nationwide presence.\nThe Company\u2019s Food Distribution and Retail segments compete with, among others, regional and national grocery distributors, large chain stores that have integrated wholesale and retail operations, mass merchandisers, e-Commerce providers, limited assortment stores and wholesale membership clubs, many of which have greater resources than the Company. Some of the distribution and retail competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial resources and advantages than the Company, intensifying competition at the wholesale and retail levels.\nThe effects of industry consolidation and the expansion of alternative store formats have resulted in, and continue to result in, market share losses for traditional grocery stores. In addition, the Company is facing increasing competition from nontraditional competitors and in alternative sales channels, including e-commerce. These trends have produced even stronger competition for the Company\u2019s Retail business and for the independent customers of the Company\u2019s Food Distribution business. To the extent the Company\u2019s independent customers are acquired by one of the Company\u2019s competitors or are not successful in competing with other retail chains and non-traditional competitors, sales by the Company\u2019s Food Distribution business will be affected. If the Company fails to implement strategies to respond effectively to these competitive pressures, its operating results could be adversely affected by price reductions, decreased sales or margins, or loss of customer base.\nThis competition may result in reduced profit margins and other harmful effects on the Company and the Food Distribution customers that the Company supplies. Ongoing industry consolidation could result in loss of the Company\u2019s existing customers and could confront its retail operations with competition from larger and better-capitalized chains in existing or new geographic areas. The Company may not be able to compete successfully in this environment.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses could be negatively affected if it fails to retain existing customers or attract a significant number of new customers.\nGrowing and increasing the profitability of the Company\u2019s distribution businesses is dependent in large measure upon its ability to retain existing customers and capture additional distribution customers through its existing network of distribution centers, which enables the Company to more effectively utilize the fixed assets in those businesses. The Company\u2019s ability to achieve these goals is dependent, in part, upon its ability to continue to provide a high level of customer service, offer competitive products at low prices, maintain high levels of productivity and efficiency, particularly in the process of integrating new customers into its distribution system, and offer marketing, merchandising and ancillary services that provide value to its independent customers. If the Company is unable to execute these tasks effectively, it may not be able to attract a significant number of new customers, and attrition among its existing customer base could increase, either or both of which could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s revenue and profitability.\nGrowing and increasing the profitability of the Company\u2019s Retail business is dependent upon increasing its customer base in the communities where the Company\u2019s corporate-owned retail stores are located. The Company plans to invest in redesigning some of its corporate-owned retail stores into other formats in order to attract new customers. The Company\u2019s results of operations may be adversely impacted if it is unable to attract a significant number of new retail customers.\nThe Company may not be able to implement its strategy of growth through acquisitions.\nPart of the Company\u2019s growth strategy involves selected acquisitions of additional retail grocery stores, grocery store chains or distribution facilities. Because the Company operates in the Food Distribution business, future acquisitions of retail grocery stores could result in the Company competing with its independent grocery store customers and could adversely affect existing business relationships with those customers. As a result, the Company may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future, complete acquisitions or obtain the necessary financing. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to implement this part of its growth strategy or achieve expected results and long-term business goals as the success of its acquisitions will depend, in part, on whether the Company achieves the business synergies and anticipated cost savings in connection with these transactions and any future acquisitions.\nSubstantial operating losses may occur if the customers to whom the Company extends credit or for whom the Company guarantees loans or lease obligations fail to repay the Company.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company extends credit, including loans, to its Food Distribution customers, and provides financial assistance to some customers by guaranteeing their loan or lease obligations. The Company also leases store sites for sublease to independent retailers. Generally, the Company\u2019s loans and other financial accommodations are extended to small businesses that are unrelated and may have limited access to conventional financing. The Company also subleases retail properties and assigns retail property leases to third parties in the ordinary course of business. While the Company seeks to obtain security interest and other credit support in connection with the financial accommodations the Company extends, such collateral may not be sufficient to cover its exposure. Greater than expected losses from existing or future credit extensions, loans, guarantee commitments or sublease arrangements could negatively and potentially materially impact the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in relationships with the Company\u2019s vendor base may adversely affect its business, margins, and profitability.\nThe Company sources the products it sells from a wide variety of vendors. The Company generally does not have long-term written contracts with its major suppliers that would require them to continue supplying it with merchandise. The Company depends on its vendors for, among other things, appropriate allocation of merchandise, assortments of products, operation of vendor-focused shopping experiences within its stores, and funding for various forms of promotional allowances. There has been significant consolidation in the food industry, and this consolidation may continue to the Company\u2019s commercial disadvantage. Such changes could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s revenues and profitability. The Company cooperatively engages in a variety of promotional programs with its vendors. The Company manages these programs to maintain or improve margins and increase sales. A reduction or change in promotional spending could have a significant impact on profitability.\nThe Company depends heavily on its ability to purchase merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. The Company has no assurances of continued supply, pricing, or access to new products and any vendor could at any time change the terms upon which it sells to the Company or discontinue selling to the Company. Vendor supplies can be adversely affected by weather, food contamination, regulatory actions, labor supply, strikes, labor unrest or product vendor defaults or disputes that limit the Company\u2019s ability to procure products for sale to customers.\nDisruptions to the Company\u2019s information technology systems, including security breaches and cyber-attacks, could negatively affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company has large, complex IT systems that are important to its business operations. The Company could incur significant losses due to disruptions in its systems and business if it were to experience difficulties accessing data stored in its IT systems.\nThe Company gathers and stores sensitive information, including personal information about its customers and associates as well as proprietary information of its customers and vendors. Although the Company has implemented security programs and disaster recovery facilities and procedures, security could be compromised and systems disruptions, data theft or other criminal activity could occur. This could result in a loss of sales or profits or cause the Company to incur significant costs to restore its systems or to reimburse third parties for damages.\nAs a merchant that accepts debit and credit cards for payment, the Company is subject to the Payment Card Industry (\u201cPCI\u201d) Data Security Standard (\u201cDSS\u201d), issued by the PCI Council. PCI DSS contains compliance guidelines and standards with regard to the Company\u2019s security involving the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. By accepting debit cards for payment, the Company is also subject to compliance with American National Standards Institute data encryption standards, and payment network security operating guidelines. Despite the Company\u2019s compliance with these standards and other information security measures, the Company cannot be certain that all of its IT systems are able to prevent, contain or detect any cyber-attacks or security breaches from known malware or malware that may be developed in the future. To the extent that any disruption results in the loss, damage or misappropriation of information, the Company may be adversely affected by claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card associations and others. In addition, the cost of complying with stricter privacy and information security laws and standards could be significant to the Company.\nThreats to security or the occurrence of severe weather conditions, natural disasters or health pandemics could harm the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s business could be severely impacted by wartime activities, threats or acts of terrorism, severe weather conditions, natural disasters, or widespread health pandemics. Any of these events could affect the transportation infrastructure used by both the Company and its vendors to supply the Company\u2019s warehouses, corporate-owned retail stores, and Military and Food Distribution customers. While the Company believes it has adopted commercially reasonable precautions, insurance programs, and contingency plans; the destruction of, or substantial damage to, its distribution centers and corporate-owned retail stores due to natural disaster, severe weather conditions, accident, terrorism, or other causes could substantially compromise the Company\u2019s ability to distribute products or generate sales at its corporate-owned retail stores. Additionally, unseasonably adverse climatic conditions that impact growing conditions and the crops of food producers could also adversely affect the availability or cost of certain products. Any of the above events could result in a loss of sales, profits and asset value.\nImpairment charges for goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is required to perform an annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. Testing goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment requires management to make significant estimates about the Company\u2019s future performance, cash flows, and other assumptions that can be affected by potential changes in economic, industry or market conditions, business operations, competition, or the Company\u2019s stock price and market capitalization. Changes in these factors, or changes in actual performance compared with estimates of the Company\u2019s future performance, may affect the fair value of goodwill or other intangible assets. This could result in the Company recording a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of the goodwill or other intangible assets in the period the determination of impairment is made. The Company cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets. Should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Company may be unable to successfully integrate the businesses of Spartan Stores and Nash-Finch and realize the anticipated benefits of the merger.\nThe merger involved the combination of two companies that formerly operated as independent public companies. The combined Company continues to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of Spartan Stores and Nash-Finch. The combined company may encounter complexities associated with managing the businesses of the combined company, in a seamless manner that minimizes adverse effects on customers, suppliers, associates and other constituencies. The Company\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address challenges related to the management and monitoring of the integrated operations of Nash-Finch and Spartan Stores and associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurances that the combined company will be successful or that it will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the merger.\nThe Company is expected to incur substantial expenses related to the continued integration of Spartan Stores and Nash-Finch.\nThe Company continues to incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of Spartan Stores and Nash-Finch. There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that have been or will be integrated. The Company continues to maintain an administrative presence in Grand Rapids, Michigan; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Norfolk, Virginia. There are many factors beyond its control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. These integration expenses may continue to result in the combined company taking charges against earnings and the amount and exact timing of such charges are somewhat uncertain.\nRestrictive covenants imposed by the Company\u2019s credit facility and other factors could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to borrow.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to borrow additional funds is governed by the terms of its credit facilities. The credit facilities contain financial and other covenants that, among other things, limit the Company\u2019s ability to draw down the full amount of the facility, incur additional debt outside of the credit facility, create new liens on property, make acquisitions, or pay dividends. These covenants may affect the Company\u2019s operating flexibility and may require it to seek the consent of the lenders to certain transactions that the Company may wish to effect. The Company is not currently restricted by these covenants. Disruptions in the financial markets have in the past resulted in bank failures. One or more of the participants in the credit facility could become unable to fund the Company\u2019s future borrowings when needed. The Company believes that cash generated from operating activities and available borrowings under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments and debt service obligations for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that the business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels or that the Company will maintain its ability to borrow under its credit facility. The Company may not be able to refinance its existing debt at similar terms.\nMaintaining the Company\u2019s reputation and corporate image is essential to the Company\u2019s business success.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on the value and strength of its corporate name and reputation. The Company\u2019s name, reputation and image are integral to its business as well as to the implementation of its strategies for expanding its business. The Company\u2019s business prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if its public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity including dissemination via print, broadcast or social media, or other forms of Internet-based communications. Adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against the Company could damage its reputation and image, undermine its customers\u2019 confidence and reduce long-term demand for its products and services, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to its operations. Any of these events could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company may be unable to retain its key management personnel.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of senior management. The loss of any key member of the Company\u2019s management team may prevent it from implementing its business plans in a timely manner. The Company cannot assure that successors of comparable ability will be identified and appointed and that the Company\u2019s business will not be adversely affected.\nMarket Risks\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to risks from regional economic conditions, fuel prices, and other factors in its geographic areas.\nThe Company\u2019s business is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions. In recent years, the United States has experienced volatility in the economy and financial markets due to uncertainties related to energy prices, availability of credit, difficulties in the banking and financial services sector, the decline in the housing market, diminished market liquidity, falling consumer confidence and high unemployment rates. These adverse economic conditions in its geographic areas, potential reduction in the populations in its geographic areas and the loss of purchasing power by residents in its geographic areas could reduce the amount and mix of groceries purchased, could cause consumers to trade down to less expensive mix of products or to trade down to discounters, all of which may affect the Company\u2019s revenues and profitability.\nGasoline prices may affect consumer behavior and retail grocery prices. If petroleum prices rise in the future it may prompt consumers to make different choices in how and where they shop due to the high price of gasoline. Additionally, the impact of higher fuel costs is passed through by manufacturers and distributors in the prices of goods and services provided, again potentially affecting consumer buying decisions. This could have adverse impacts on retail store traffic, basket size and overall spending at both its corporate-owned and independent retail grocery stores.\nIn addition, many of the Company\u2019s corporate-owned retail stores, as well as stores operated by its Food Distribution customers, are located in areas that are heavily dependent upon tourism. Unseasonable weather conditions and the economic conditions discussed above may decrease tourism activity and could result in decreased sales by the Company\u2019s corporate-owned retail stores and decreased sales to stores operated by its Food Distribution customers, adversely affecting the Company\u2019s revenues and profitability.\nEconomic downturns and uncertainty have adversely affected overall demand and intensified price competition, and have caused consumers to \u201ctrade down\u201d by purchasing lower margin items and to make fewer purchases in traditional supermarket channels. Continued negative economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels, business conditions, changes in housing market conditions, increases in the cost of healthcare coverage, the availability of credit, interest rates, volatility in fuel and energy costs, food price inflation or deflation, employment trends in its geographic areas and labor costs, the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism, and other matters affecting consumer spending could cause consumers to continue shifting even more of their spending to lower-priced products and competitors. The continued general reductions in the level of discretionary spending or shifts in consumer discretionary spending to the Company\u2019s competitors could adversely affect the Company\u2019s growth and profitability.\nDisruptions to worldwide financial and credit markets could potentially reduce the availability of liquidity and credit generally necessary to fund a continuation and expansion of global economic activity. A shortage of liquidity and credit in certain regions has the potential to lead to worldwide economic difficulties that could be prolonged. A general slowdown in the economic activity caused by an extended period of economic uncertainty could adversely affect the Company\u2019s businesses. Difficult financial and economic conditions could also adversely affect its customers\u2019 ability to meet the terms of sale or its suppliers\u2019 ability to fully perform their commitments to the Company.\nMacroeconomic and geopolitical events may adversely affect the Company\u2019s customers, access to products, or lead to general cost increases which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe impact of events in foreign countries, which could result in increased political instability and social unrest, and the economic ramifications of significant budget deficits in the United States and changes in policy attributable to them at both the federal and state levels, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s businesses and customers. Adverse economic or geopolitical events could potentially reduce the Company\u2019s access to or increase prices associated with products sourced abroad. Such adverse events could lead to significant increases in the price of the products the Company procures, fuel and other supplies used in the Company\u2019s business, utilities, or taxes that cannot be fully recovered through price increases. In addition, disposable consumer income could be affected by these events, which could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nInflation and deflation may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nIt is difficult to forecast whether fiscal 2016 will be a period of inflation or deflation. Food deflation could reduce sales growth and earnings, while food inflation, combined with reduced consumer spending, could reduce gross profit margins. If the Company experiences significant inflation or deflation, especially in the context of continued lower consumer spending, then the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nLegal, Regulatory and Legislative Risks\nThe Company\u2019s Military segment operations are dependent upon domestic and international military distribution. A change in the military commissary system, or level of governmental funding, could negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause the Company\u2019s Military segment sells and distributes grocery products to military commissaries and exchanges in the United States and overseas, any material changes in the commissary system, the level of governmental funding to DeCA, military staffing levels, or the locations of bases may have a corresponding impact on the sales and operating performance of this segment. These changes could include privatization of some or all of the military commissary system, relocation or consolidation of commissaries and exchanges, base closings, troop redeployments or consolidations in the geographic areas containing commissaries and exchanges served by the Company, or a reduction in the number of persons having access to the commissaries and exchanges. Mandated reductions in the government expenditures, including those imposed as a result of sequestration, may impact the level of funding to DeCA and could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s operations.\nGovernment regulation could harm the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company is subject to extensive governmental laws and regulations including, but not limited to, employment and wage laws and regulations, regulations governing the sale of pharmaceuticals, alcohol and tobacco, minimum wage requirements, working condition requirements, public accessibility requirements, citizenship requirements, environmental regulation, and other laws and regulations. A violation or change of these laws could have a material effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLike other companies that sell food and drugs, the Company\u2019s corporate-owned retail stores are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, and administrative practices affecting its business. The Company must comply with numerous provisions regulating health and sanitation standards, facilities inspection, food labeling, and licensing for the sale of food, drugs, tobacco, and alcoholic beverages.\nThe Company cannot predict the nature of future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, or determine what effect either additional government regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, or disparate federal, state, local, and foreign regulatory requirements will have on its future business. They could, however, require that the Company recall or discontinue sale of certain products, make substantial changes to its facilities or operations, or otherwise result in substantial increases in operating expense. Any or all of such requirements could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to state and federal environmental regulations.\nUnder various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, the Company may, as the owner or operator of its locations, be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of contamination at these current or former locations, whether or not the Company knew of, or were responsible for, the presences of such contamination. The failure to properly remediate such contamination may subject the Company to liability to third parties and may adversely affect its ability to sell or lease such property or to borrow money using such property as collateral.\nCompliance with existing and future environmental laws regulating underground storage tanks may require significant capital expenditures and increased operating and maintenance costs.\nThe remediation costs and other costs required to clean up or treat contaminated sites could be substantial. In the future, the Company may incur substantial expenditures for remediation of contamination that has not been discovered at existing or acquired locations. The Company cannot assure that it has identified all environmental liabilities at all of its current and former locations; that material environmental conditions not known to the Company do not exist; that future laws, ordinances or regulations will not impose material environmental liability on the Company; or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of its locations. In addition, failure to comply with any environmental laws, ordinances or regulations or an increase in regulations could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in accounting standards could materially impact the Company\u2019s results.\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations for many aspects of the Company\u2019s business, such as accounting for insurance and self-insurance, inventories, goodwill and intangible assets, store closures, leases, vendor and customer contracts, income taxes and share-based payments, are highly complex and involve subjective judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation could significantly change or add significant volatility to the Company\u2019s reported earnings without a comparable underlying change in cash flow from operations.\nSafety concerns regarding the Company\u2019s products could harm the Company\u2019s business.\nIt is sometimes necessary for the Company to recall unsafe, contaminated or defective products. Recall costs can be material and the Company might not be able to recover costs from its suppliers. Concerns regarding the safety of food products sold by the Company could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from the Company, or to seek alternative sources of supply for some or all of their food needs, even if the basis for concern is outside of the Company\u2019s control. Any loss of confidence on the part of the Company\u2019s customers would be difficult and costly to overcome. Any real or perceived issue regarding the safety of any food or drug items sold by the Company, regardless of the cause, could have a substantial and adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nA number of the Company\u2019s Food Distribution and Military segment associates are covered by collective bargaining agreements.\nApproximately 51% and 16% of the Company\u2019s associates in its Food Distribution and Military business segments, respectively, are covered by collective bargaining agreements which expire between April 2016 and October 2017. The Company expects that rising healthcare, pension and other employee benefit costs, among other issues, will continue to be important topics of negotiation with the labor unions. Upon the expiration of the Company\u2019s collective bargaining agreements, work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if the Company is unable to negotiate an acceptable contract with the labor unions. This could significantly disrupt the Company\u2019s operations. Further, if the Company is unable to control healthcare and pension costs provided for in the collective bargaining agreements, the Company may experience increased operating costs and an adverse impact on future results of operations.\nUnions may attempt to organize additional associates.\nWhile the Company believes that relations with its associates are good, the Company may continue to see additional union organizing campaigns. The potential for unionization could increase as any new related legislation or regulations are passed. The Company respects its associates\u2019 right to unionize or not to unionize. However, the unionization of a significant portion of the Company\u2019s workforce could increase the Company\u2019s overall costs at the affected locations and adversely affect its flexibility to run its business in the most efficient manner to remain competitive or acquire new business and could adversely affect its results of operations by increasing its labor costs or otherwise restricting its ability to maximize the efficiency of its operations.\nCosts related to multi-employer pension plans and other postretirement plans could increase.\nThe Company contributes to the Central States Southeast and Southwest Pension Fund (\u201cCentral States Plan\u201d or \u201cthe Plan\u201d), a multi-employer pension plan, based on obligations arising from its collective bargaining agreements with Teamsters locals 406 and 908. SpartanNash does not administer or control this Plan, and the Company has relatively little control over the level of contributions the Company is required to make. Currently, the Central States Plan is underfunded, and as a result, contributions are scheduled to increase. The Company expects that contributions to this Plan will be subject to further increases. Benefit levels and related issues will continue to create collective bargaining challenges. The amount of any increase or decrease in its required contributions to this Plan will depend upon the outcome of collective bargaining, the actions taken by the trustees who manage the Plan, governmental regulations, actual return on investment of Plan assets, the continued viability and contributions of other contributing employers, and the potential payment of withdrawal liability should the Company choose to exit a geographic area, among other factors.\nUnder current law, an employer that withdraws or partially withdraws from a multi-employer pension plan may incur a withdrawal liability to the plan if it is underfunded. The assessed withdrawal liability represents the portion of the plan\u2019s underfunding that is allocable to the withdrawing employer under very complex actuarial and allocation rules. Withdrawal liability may be incurred under a variety of circumstances, including selling, closing or substantially reducing employment at a facility. Withdrawal liability could be material, and potential exposure to withdrawal liability may influence business decisions and could cause the Company to forgo business opportunities. The Company is currently unable to reasonably estimate such liability. On December 13, 2014, Congress passed the Multi-employer Pension Reform Act of 2014 (\u201cMPRA\u201d). The MPRA is intended to address funding shortfalls in both multi-employer pension plans and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Because the MPRA is a complex piece of legislation, its effects on the Plan and potential implications for the Company are not known at this time. Any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated.\nOn September 25, 2015, Central States submitted a Rescue Plan to the United States Department of Treasury (\u201cDepartment of Treasury\u201d) as permitted under the provisions of the MPRA relating to plans in \u201ccritical and declining status.\u201d Under the Rescue Plan, Trustees seek to suspend the pension benefits of retirees and actives in order to save the pension plan from future financial failure. The proposed Rescue Plan is tiered and intended to equitably distribute benefit suspensions across three participant classes: orphans, participants and UPS transfer group. Under the MPRA, the Department of Treasury has 225 days in which to consider and act on the proposed Plan. Following the Department of Treasury\u2019s review, Plan participants will be afforded the opportunity to consider and vote on the proposed benefit suspensions. Given the Department of Treasury\u2019s review period and the amount of time necessary for a participant vote, Central States estimates that the proposed benefit suspensions, if approved, would not take effect until July 1, 2016. The Company is currently unable to reasonably estimate the potential impact of this Rescue Plan on its withdrawal liability.\nThe Company maintains defined benefit retirement plans for certain of its associates that do not participate in multi-employer pension plans. These plans are frozen. Expenses associated with the defined benefit plans may significantly increase due to changes to actuarial assumptions or investment returns on plan assets that are less favorable than projected. In addition, changes in the Company\u2019s funding status could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial position.\nCosts related to associate healthcare benefits are expected to continue to increase.\nThe Company provides health benefits for a large number of associates. The Company\u2019s costs to provide such benefits continue to increase annually and recent legislative initiatives regarding healthcare reform have had a direct financial impact. However, the Company has carefully analyzed the costs of compliance with these initiatives and believes it has mitigated much of the impact through plan design and vendor negotiations. The Company will continue to stay abreast of these legislative changes and monitor their impact. Future legislative changes could negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Company participates in various multi-employer health plans for its union associates, and the Company is required to make contributions to these plans in amounts established under collective bargaining agreements. The cost of providing benefits through such plans has escalated rapidly in recent years. The amount of any increase or decrease in the Company\u2019s required contributions to these multi-employer plans will depend upon many factors, many of which are beyond its control. If the Company is unable to control the costs of providing healthcare to associates, it may experience increased operating costs, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks associated with insurance plan claims could increase future expenses.\nThe Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liabilities for workers\u2019 compensation, automobile and general liability, property insurance, director and officers\u2019 liability insurance, and employee healthcare benefits. The liabilities that have been recorded for these claims represent the Company\u2019s best estimate, using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods, of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through January 2, 2016. Any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. Changes in legal trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, and changes in discount rates could all affect the level of reserves required and could cause future expense to maintain reserves at appropriate levels.", "PERMNO": 88568, "SIC": 5141, "TIC": "SPTN"}
