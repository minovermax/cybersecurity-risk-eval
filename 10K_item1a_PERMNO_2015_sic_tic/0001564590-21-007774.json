{"cik": "104918", "company": "AVISTA CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRISK FACTORS\nThe following factors could have a significant impact on our operations, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. These factors could cause future results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in our reports filed with the SEC (including this Annual Report on Form 10-K), and elsewhere. Please also see \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d for additional factors which could have a significant impact on our operations, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows and could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.\nUtility Regulatory Risk Factors\nRegulators may not grant rates that provide timely or sufficient recovery of our costs or allow a reasonable rate of return for our shareholders.\nAvista Utilities' annual operating expenses and the costs associated with incremental investments in utility assets continue to grow at a faster rate than revenue. Our ability to recover these expenses and capital costs depends on the adequacy and timeliness of retail rate increases allowed by regulatory agencies. We expect to periodically file for rate increases with regulatory agencies to recover our expenses and capital costs and provide an opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return for shareholders. If regulators do not grant rate increases or grant substantially lower rate increases than our requests in the future or if recovery of deferred expenses is disallowed, it could have a negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. See further discussion of regulatory matters in \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis - Regulatory Matters.\"\nIn the future, we may no longer meet the criteria for continued application of regulatory accounting principles for all or a portion of our regulated operations.\nIf we could no longer apply regulatory accounting principles, we could be:\n\u2022\nrequired to write off our regulatory assets, and be\n\u2022\nprecluded from the future deferral of costs or decoupled revenues not recovered through rates at the time such amounts are incurred, even if we are expected to recover these amounts from customers in the future.\nSee further discussion at \"Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Regulatory Deferred Charges and Credits.\"\nOperational Risk Factors\nWildfires ignited, or allegedly ignited, by Avista Corp. equipment or facilities, could cause significant loss of life and property, thereby causing serious operational and financial harm to Avista Corp. and our customers.\nOur equipment may be the ignition, or alleged cause of ignition, source for wildfires and in the event of a fire caused by our equipment, we could potentially be held liable for resulting damages to life and property, as well as fire suppression costs. Also, wildfires could lead to extended operational outages of our equipment while we wait for the wildfire to be extinguished before restoring power, and the cost to implement rapid response or any repair to such facilities could be significant. Any wildfires caused by our equipment could cause significant damage to our reputation, which could erode shareholder, customer and community satisfaction with our Company. In addition, wildfires caused by our equipment could lead to increased insurance costs, loss of insurance coverage, the need to be self-insured or the need to consider non-traditional insurance coverage or other risk mitigation procedures.\nThe COVID 19 pandemic is disrupting our business and could have a negative effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is currently impacting our business, as well as the global, national and local economy. We cannot predict the full extent to which COVID-19 will impact our operations, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition or capital resources. It is possible that the continued spread of COVID-19 and efforts to contain the virus will continue to cause an economic slowdown, resulting in significant disruptions in various public, commercial or industrial activities and causing\nAVISTA CORPORATION\nemployee absences which could interfere with operation and maintenance of the Company\u2019s facilities. Any of these circumstances could adversely affect our operations, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in many ways, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\na decrease in customer demand and revenues due to a reduction in economic activity,\n\u2022\nan increase in operating expenses, including bad debt expense due to our customers\u2019 inability to pay amounts due to us,\n\u2022\na decrease in net operating cash inflows, which could negatively impact our liquidity and limit our ability to fund capital expenditures, dividends, and other contractual commitments,\n\u2022\na negative impact on the ability of suppliers, vendors or contractors to perform, which could increase costs and delay capital projects,\n\u2022\npossible reluctance on the part of regulatory commissions to approve our requests to defer and recover increased expenses,\n\u2022\ndelays in regulatory filings and the regulatory approval process, which could impact our ability to timely recover our operating expenses and costs associated with investments in utility assets,\n\u2022\nan increase in cyber and technology risks, including the impact on internal controls, due to a significant number of employees working remotely,\n\u2022\ndisruption, weakness and volatility in the financial markets, which could increase our costs to fund capital requirements, and\n\u2022\npossible limited access to the capital markets, that could require us to seek alternative sources of funding for operations and for working capital, any of which could increase our cost of capital.\nWe cannot predict the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. The longer and more severe the economic restrictions and business disruptions are, the greater the impact on our operations, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will be.\nWe are subject to various operational and event risks.\nOur operations are subject to operational and event risks that include:\n\u2022\nsevere weather or natural disasters, including, but not limited to, avalanches, wind storms, wildfires, earthquakes, snow and ice storms, which could disrupt energy generation, transmission and distribution, as well as the availability and costs of materials, equipment, supplies, support services and general business operations,\n\u2022\nblackouts or disruptions of interconnected transmission systems (the regional power grid),\n\u2022\nunplanned outages at generating plants,\n\u2022\nchanges in the availability and cost of purchased power, fuel and natural gas, including delivery constraints,\n\u2022\nexplosions, fires, accidents, or mechanical breakdowns that could occur while operating and maintaining our generation, transmission and distribution systems,\n\u2022\nproperty damage or injuries to third parties caused by our generation, transmission and distribution systems,\n\u2022\nnatural disasters that can disrupt energy generation, transmission and distribution, and general business operations,\n\u2022\nterrorist attacks or other malicious acts that may disrupt or cause damage to our utility assets or the vendors we utilize, and\n\u2022\nwork-force issues, including changes in collective bargaining unit agreements, strikes, work stoppages, the loss of key executives, availability of workers in a variety of skill areas, and our ability to recruit and retain employees.\nAVISTA CORPORATION\nDisasters could affect the general economy, financial and capital markets, specific industries, or our ability to conduct business. As protection against operational and event risks, we maintain business continuity and disaster recovery plans, maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses and we seek to negotiate indemnification arrangements with contractors for certain event risks. However, insurance or indemnification agreements may not be adequate to protect us against liability, extra expenses and operating disruptions from all of the operational and event risks described above. In addition, we are subject to the risk that insurers and/or other parties will dispute or be unable to perform on their obligations to us. If insurance or indemnification agreements are unable to adequately protect us or reimburse us for out-of-pocket costs, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nDamage to facilities could be caused by severe weather or natural disasters, such as snow, ice, wind storms, wildfires, earthquakes or avalanches. The cost to implement rapid response or any repair to such facilities can be significant. Overhead electric lines are most susceptible to damage caused by severe weather and are not covered by insurance.\nAdverse impacts to AEL&P could result from an extended outage of its hydroelectric generating resources or its inability to deliver energy, due to its lack of interconnectivity to any other electrical grids and the cost of replacement power (diesel).\nAEL&P operates several hydroelectric power generation facilities and has diesel generating capacity from multiple facilities to provide backup service to firm customers when necessary; however, a single hydroelectric power generation facility, the Snettisham hydroelectric project, provides approximately two-thirds of AEL&P\u2019s hydroelectric power generation. Any issues that negatively affect AEL&P's ability to generate or transmit power or any decrease in the demand for the power generated by AEL&P could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nCyber and Technology Risk Factors\nCyberattacks, ransomware, terrorism or other malicious acts could disrupt our businesses and have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows.\nIn the course of our operations, we rely on interconnected technology systems for operation of our generating plants, electric transmission and distribution systems, natural gas distribution systems, customer billing and customer service, accounting and other administrative processes and compliance with various regulations. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we collect and retain sensitive information including personal information about our customers and employees.\nCyberattacks, ransomware, terrorism or other malicious acts could damage, destroy or disrupt these systems for an extended period of time. The energy sector, particularly electric and natural gas utility companies have become the subject of cyberattacks with increased frequency. Our administrative and operating networks are targeted by hackers on a regular basis. Additionally, the facilities and systems of clients, suppliers and third party service providers could be vulnerable to the same cyber or terrorism risks as our facilities and systems and such third party systems may be interconnected to our systems both physically and technologically. Therefore, an event caused by cyberattacks, ransomware or other malicious act at an interconnected third party could impact our business and facilities similarly. Any failure, unexpected, or unauthorized use of technology systems could result in the unavailability of such systems, and could result in a loss of operating revenues, an increase in operating expenses and costs to repair or replace damaged assets. Any of the above could also result in the loss or release of confidential customer and/or employee information or other proprietary data that could adversely affect our reputation and competitiveness, could result in costly litigation and negatively impact our results of operations. These cyberattacks have become more common and sophisticated and, as such, we could be required to incur costs to strengthen our systems and respond to emerging concerns.\nTerrorist attacks could also be directed at our physical electric and natural gas facilities, as well as technology systems or at an interconnected third party, which could result in disruption to our systems.\nThere are various risks associated with technology systems such as hardware or software failure, communications failure, data distortion or destruction, unauthorized access to data, misuse of proprietary or confidential data, unauthorized control through electronic means, programming mistakes and other deliberate or inadvertent human errors.\nAVISTA CORPORATION\nOur technology may become obsolete or we may not have sufficient resources to manage our technology.\nOur technology may become obsolete before the end of its useful life. In addition, custom technology that is heavily relied upon by us may not be maintained and updated appropriately due to resource restraints, or other factors, which could cause technology failures or give rise to additional operational or security risks. Technology failures could result in significant adverse effects on our physical operations, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may be adversely affected by our inability to successfully implement certain technology projects.\nThere are inherent risks associated with replacing and changing systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Finally, there is the risk that we ultimately do not complete a project and will incur contract cancellation or other costs, which could be significant.\nStrategic Risk Factors\nOur strategic business plans, which may be affected by any or all of the foregoing, may change, including the entry into new businesses and/or the exit from existing businesses and/or the curtailment of our business development efforts where potential future business is uncertain.\nOur strategic business plans could be affected by or result in any of the following:\n\u2022\ndisruptive innovations in the marketplace may outpace our ability to compete or manage our risk,\n\u2022\ncustomers may have a choice in the future over the sources from which to receive their energy and we may not be able to compete,\n\u2022\npotential difficulties in integrating acquired operations and in realizing expected opportunities, diversions of management resources and losses of key employees, challenges with respect to operating new businesses and other unanticipated risks and liabilities,\n\u2022\nnon-regulated investments may increase earnings volatility,\n\u2022\nmarket or other conditions that could adversely affect our operations or require changes to our business strategy and could result in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge that would reduce assets and net income,\n\u2022\npotential reputational risk arising from repeated general rate case filings, degradation in the quality of service, or from failed strategic investments and opportunities, which could erode shareholder, customer and community satisfaction with the Company, and\n\u2022\nthe risk of municipalization or other form of service territory reduction.\nExternal Mandates Risk Factors\nExternal mandate risk involves forces outside the Company, which may include significant changes in customer expectations, disruptive technologies that result in obsolescence of our business model and government action that could impact the Company.\nActions or limitations to address concerns over long-term climate change, both globally and within our utilities' service areas, may affect our operations and financial performance.\nLegislative, regulatory and advocacy efforts at the state, national and international levels concerning climate change and other environmental issues could have significant impacts on our operations. The electric and natural gas utility industries are frequently affected by proposals to curb greenhouse gas and other air emissions. Various regulatory and legislative proposals have been made to limit or further restrict byproducts of combustion, including that resulting from the use of natural gas by our customers. In addition, regionally, there are a number of regulatory and legislative initiatives that have been passed which are designed to limit greenhouse gas emissions and increase the use of renewable sources of energy. Such legislation could restrict the operation and raise the costs of our power generation resources as well as the distribution of natural gas to our customers.\nAVISTA CORPORATION\nWe expect continuing activity in the future and we are evaluating the extent to which potential changes to environmental laws and regulations may:\n\u2022\nincrease the operating costs of generating plants,\n\u2022\nincrease the lead time and capital costs for the construction of new generating plants,\n\u2022\nrequire modification of our existing generating plants,\n\u2022\nrequire existing generating plant operations to be curtailed or shut down,\n\u2022\nreduce the amount of energy available from our generating plants,\n\u2022\nrestrict the types of generating plants that can be built or contracted with,\n\u2022\nrequire construction of specific types of generation plants at higher cost, and\n\u2022\nincrease the cost or limit our ability to distribute natural gas to customers.\nSee \u201cItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis - Environmental Issues and Contingencies\" for discussion regarding environmental and other issues which may affect our operations, including the CETA that was recently passed in Washington State.\nWe have contingent liabilities, including certain matters related to potential environmental liabilities, and cannot predict the outcome of these matters.\nIn the normal course of our business, we have matters that are the subject of ongoing litigation, mediation, investigation and/or negotiation. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome or potential impact of any particular issue, including the extent, if any, of insurance coverage or that amounts payable by us may be recoverable through the ratemaking process. We are subject to environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities related to our past, present and future operations. See \u201cNote 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d for further details of these matters.\nImport tariffs could lead to increased prices on raw materials that are critical to our business.\nTariffs and other restrictions on trade with foreign countries could significantly increase the prices of raw materials that are critical to our business, such as steel poles or wires. In addition, tariffs and trade restrictions could have a similar impact on our suppliers and certain customers, which could have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSee \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis - Environmental Issues and Contingencies\" and \"Forward-Looking Statements\" for discussion of or reference to additional external mandates which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFinancial Risk Factors\nWeather (temperatures, precipitation levels, wind patterns and storms) has a significant effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWeather impacts are described in the following subtopics:\n\u2022\ncertain retail electricity and natural gas sales,\n\u2022\nthe cost of natural gas supply, and\n\u2022\nthe cost of power supply.\nCertain retail electricity and natural gas sales volumes vary directly with changes in temperatures. We normally have our highest retail (electric and natural gas) energy sales during the winter heating season in the first and fourth quarters of the year. We also have high electricity demand for air conditioning during the summer (third quarter). In general, warmer weather in the heating season and cooler weather in the cooling season will reduce our customers\u2019 energy demand and our retail operating revenues. The revenue and earnings impact of weather fluctuations is somewhat mitigated by our decoupling mechanisms;\nAVISTA CORPORATION\nhowever, we could experience liquidity constraints during the period between when decoupling revenue is earned and when it is subsequently collected from customers through retail rates.\nThe cost of natural gas supply is impacted by both supply-side factors (amount of natural gas production, level of natural gas in storage, volumes of natural gas imports and exports) and demand-side factors (variations in winter and summer weather, level of economic growth, availability and prices of other fuels). Prices tend to increase with higher demand during periods of cold weather. Inter-regional natural gas pipelines and competition for supply can allow demand-driven price volatility in other regions of North America to affect prices in the Pacific Northwest, even though there may be less extreme weather conditions in the Pacific Northwest. Increased costs adversely affect cash flows when we purchase natural gas for retail supply at prices above the amount allowed for recovery in retail rates. We defer differences between actual natural gas supply costs and the amount currently recovered in retail rates and we are generally allowed to recover substantially all of these differences after regulatory review. However, these deferred costs require cash outflows from the time of natural gas purchases until the costs are later recovered through retail sales.\nThe cost of power supply can be significantly affected by weather. Precipitation (consisting of snowpack, its water content and melting pattern plus rainfall) and other streamflow conditions (such as regional water storage operations) significantly affect hydroelectric generation capability. Variations in hydroelectric generation inversely affect our reliance on market purchases and thermal generation. To the extent that hydroelectric generation is less than normal, significantly more costly power supply resources must be acquired and the ability to realize net benefits from surplus hydroelectric wholesale sales is reduced. Wholesale prices also vary based on wind patterns as wind generation capacity is material in the Pacific Northwest but its contribution to supply is inconsistent.\nThe price of power in the wholesale energy markets tends to be higher during periods of high regional demand, such as occurs with temperature extremes. We may need to purchase power in the wholesale market during peak price periods. The price of natural gas as fuel for natural gas-fired electric generation also tends to increase during periods of high demand which are often related to temperature extremes. We may need to purchase natural gas fuel in these periods of high prices to meet electric demands. The cost of power supply during peak usage periods may be higher than the retail sales price or the amount allowed in retail rates by our regulators. To the extent that power supply costs are above the amount allowed currently in retail rates, the difference is partially absorbed by the Company in current expense and is partially deferred or shared with customers through regulatory mechanisms.\nThe price of power tends to be lower during periods with excess supply, such as the spring when hydroelectric conditions are usually at their maximum and various facilities are required to operate to meet environmental mandates. Oversupply can be exacerbated when intermittent resources such as wind generation are producing output that may be supported by price subsidies. In extreme situations, we may be required to sell excess energy at negative prices.\nAs a result of these combined factors, our net cost of power supply - the difference between our costs of generation and market purchases, reduced by our revenue from wholesale sales - varies significantly because of weather.\nWe rely on regular access to financial markets but we cannot assure favorable or reasonable financing terms will be available when we need them.\nAccess to capital markets is critical to our operations and our capital structure. We have significant capital requirements that we expect to fund, in part, by accessing capital markets. As such, the state of financial markets and credit availability in the global, United States and regional economies impacts our financial condition. We could experience increased borrowing costs or limited access to capital on reasonable terms.\nWe access long-term capital markets to finance capital expenditures, repay maturing long-term debt and obtain additional working capital from time-to-time. Our ability to access capital on reasonable terms is subject to numerous factors and market conditions, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to obtain capital on reasonable terms, it may limit or prohibit our ability to finance capital expenditures and repay maturing long-term debt. Our liquidity needs could exceed our short-term credit availability and lead to defaults on various financing arrangements. We would also likely be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock.\nAVISTA CORPORATION\nPerformance of the financial markets could also result in significant declines in the market values of assets held by our pension plan and/or a significant increase in the pension liability (which impacts the funded status of the plan) and could increase future funding obligations and pension expense.\nWe rely on credit from financial institutions for short-term borrowings. We need adequate levels of credit with financial institutions for short-term liquidity. There is no assurance that we will have access to credit beyond the expiration dates of our committed line of credit agreements. These agreements contain customary covenants and default provisions.\nAny default on the lines of credit or other financing arrangements of Avista Corp. or any of our \u201csignificant subsidiaries,\u201d if any, could result in cross-defaults to other agreements of such entity, and/or to the line of credit or other financing arrangements of any other of such entities. Any defaults could also induce vendors and other counterparties to demand collateral. In the event of any such default, it would be difficult for us to obtain financing on reasonable terms to pay creditors or fund operations. We would also likely be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock.\nWe hedge a portion of our interest rate risk with financial derivative instruments. If market interest rates decrease below the interest rates we have locked in, this will result in a liability related to our interest rate swap derivatives, which can be significant. We may be required to post cash or letters of credit as collateral depending on fluctuations in the fair value of the derivative instruments. Settlement of interest rate swap derivative instruments in a liability position could require a significant amount of cash, which could negatively impact our liquidity and short-term credit availability and increase interest expense over the term of the associated debt.\nDowngrades in our credit ratings could impede our ability to obtain financing, adversely affect the terms of financing and impact our ability to transact for or hedge energy resources. If we do not maintain our investment grade credit rating with the major credit rating agencies, we could expect increased debt service costs, limitations on our ability to access capital markets or obtain other financing on reasonable terms, and requirements to provide collateral (in the form of cash or letters of credit) to lenders and counterparties. In addition, credit rating downgrades could reduce the number of counterparties willing to do business with us or result in the termination of outstanding regulatory authorizations for certain financing activities.\nCredit risk may be affected by industry concentration and geographic concentration.\nWe have concentrations of suppliers and customers in the electric and natural gas industries including:\n\u2022\nelectric and natural gas utilities,\n\u2022\nelectric generators and transmission providers,\n\u2022\noil and natural gas producers and pipelines,\n\u2022\nfinancial institutions including commodity clearing exchanges and related parties, and\n\u2022\nenergy marketing and trading companies.\nWe have concentrations of credit risk related to our geographic location in the western United States and western Canada energy markets. These concentrations of counterparties and concentrations of geographic location may affect our overall exposure to credit risk because the counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in conditions.\nEnergy Commodity Risk Factors\nEnergy commodity price changes affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nEnergy commodity prices can be volatile. We rely on energy markets and other counterparties for energy supply, surplus and optimization transactions and commodity price hedging. A combination of factors exposes our operations to commodity price risks, including:\n\u2022\nour obligation to serve our retail customers at rates set through the regulatory process - we cannot decline to serve our customers and we cannot change retail rates to reflect current energy prices unless and until we receive regulatory approval,\nAVISTA CORPORATION\n\u2022\ncustomer demand, which is beyond our control because of weather, customer choices, prevailing economic conditions and other factors,\n\u2022\nsome of our energy supply cost is fixed by the nature of the energy-producing assets or through contractual arrangements (however, a significant portion of our energy resource costs are not fixed), and\n\u2022\nthe potential non-performance by commodity counterparties, which could lead to replacement of the scheduled energy or natural gas at higher prices.\nBecause we must supply the amount of energy demanded by our customers and we must sell it at fixed rates and only a portion of our energy supply costs are fixed, we are subject to the risk of buying energy at higher prices in wholesale energy markets (and the risk of selling energy at lower prices if we are in a surplus position). Electricity and natural gas in wholesale markets are commodities with historically high price volatility. Changes in wholesale energy prices affect, among other things, the cash requirements to purchase electricity and natural gas for retail customers or wholesale obligations and the market value of derivative assets and liabilities.\nWhen we enter into fixed price energy commodity transactions for future delivery, we are subject to credit terms that may require us to provide collateral to wholesale counterparties related to the difference between current prices and the agreed upon fixed prices. These collateral requirements can place significant demands on our cash flows or borrowing arrangements. Price volatility can cause collateral requirements to change quickly and significantly.\nCash flow deferrals related to energy commodities can be significant. We are permitted to collect from customers only amounts approved by regulatory commissions. However, our costs to provide energy service can be much higher or lower than the amounts currently billed to customers. We are permitted to defer income statement recognition and recovery from customers for some of these differences, which are recorded as deferred charges with the opportunity for future recovery through retail rates. These deferred costs are subject to review for prudence and potential disallowance by regulators, who have discretion as to the extent and timing of future recovery or refund to customers.\nPower and natural gas costs higher than those recovered in retail rates reduce cash flows. Amounts that are not allowed for deferral or which are not approved to become part of customer rates affect our results of operations.\nEven if our regulators ultimately allow us to recover deferred power and natural gas costs, our operating cash flows can be negatively affected until these costs are recovered from customers.\nFluctuating energy commodity prices and volumes in relation to our energy risk management process can cause volatility in our cash flows and results of operations. We engage in active hedging and resource optimization practices to reduce energy cost volatility and economic exposure related to commodity price fluctuations. We routinely enter into contracts to hedge a portion of our purchase and sale commitments for electricity and natural gas, as well as forecasted excess or deficit energy positions and inventories of natural gas. We use physical energy contracts and derivative instruments, such as forwards, futures, swaps and options traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. If market prices decrease compared to the prices we have locked in with our energy commodity derivatives, this will result in a liability related to these derivatives, which can be significant. As a result of price fluctuations, we may be required to post significant amounts of cash or letters of credit as collateral depending on fluctuations in the fair value of the derivative instruments.\nWe do not attempt to fully hedge our energy resource assets or our forecasted net positions for various time horizons. To the extent we have positions that are not hedged, or if hedging positions do not fully match the corresponding purchase or sale, fluctuating commodity prices could have a material effect on our operating revenues, resource costs, derivative assets and liabilities, and operating cash flows. In addition, actual loads and resources typically vary from forecasts, sometimes to a significant degree, which require additional transactions or dispatch decisions that impact cash flows.\nThe hedges we enter into are reviewed for prudence by our various regulators and any deferred costs (including those as a result of our hedging transactions) are subject to review for prudence and potential disallowance by regulators.\nAVISTA CORPORATION\nGeneration plants may become obsolete. We rely on a variety of generation and energy commodity market sources to fulfill our obligation to serve customers and meet the demands of our counterparty agreements. There is the potential that some of our generation sources, such as coal, may become obsolete or be prematurely retired through regulatory action or legislation. This could result in higher commodity costs to replace the lost generation, as well as higher costs to retire the generation source before the end of its expected life. See \u201cItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis - Environmental Issues and Contingencies\" for discussion regarding environmental and other issues surrounding Colstrip, including the requirement that we cannot serve Washington electricity customers after 2025 with Colstrip.\nCompliance Risk Factors\nThere have been numerous changes in legislation, related administrative rulemakings, and Executive Orders, including periodic audits of compliance with such rules, which may adversely affect our operational and financial performance.\nWe expect to continue to be affected by legislation at the national, state and local level, as well as by administrative rules and requirements published by government agencies, including but not limited to the FERC, the EPA and state regulators. We are also subject to NERC and WECC reliability standards. The FERC, the NERC and the WECC perform periodic audits of the Company. Failure to comply with the FERC, the NERC, or the WECC requirements can result in financial penalties.\nFuture legislation, administrative rules or Executive Orders could have a material adverse effect on our operations, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 24969, "SIC": 4931, "TIC": "AVA"}
