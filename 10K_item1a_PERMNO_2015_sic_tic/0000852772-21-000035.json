{"cik": "852772", "company": "DENNY'S Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nVarious risks and uncertainties could affect our business. Any of the risk factors described below or elsewhere in this report or our other filings with the SEC could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In any such event, the trading price of our common stock could decline. It is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and is expected to continue to disrupt our business, which could continue to have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition for an extended period of time.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has had a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial\ncondition. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the economy in general, and our business specifically,\nand it could continue to negatively affect our business in a number of ways. These effects could include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022disruptions or restrictions on our employees\u2019 ability to work effectively due to travel bans, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders or other limitations;\n\u2022temporary restrictions on and closures of our company operated restaurants and our franchised and licensed restaurants or our suppliers;\n\u2022failure of third parties on which we rely, including our franchisees and suppliers, to meet their respective obligations to the Company, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties or issues with the regional or national supply chain;\n\u2022volatility of commodity costs due to the COVID-19 outbreak;\n\u2022disruptions or uncertainties related to the COVID-19 outbreak for a sustained period of time which could hinder our ability to achieve our strategic goals and our ability to meet financial obligations as they come due; and\n\u2022customer reluctance to return to in-restaurant dining.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, or other outbreaks of disease or similar public health threats, materially and\nadversely impacts our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition is highly uncertain and will depend on\nfuture developments. Such developments may include the geographic spread and duration of the virus, the severity of the\ndisease and the actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the\noutbreak.\nIn addition, how quickly, and to what extent, normal economic and operating conditions can resume cannot be predicted, and the resumption of normal business operations may be delayed or constrained by lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on us or our franchisees, suppliers, third-party service providers, and/or customers. During 2020, many state and local governments started to ease certain restrictions on our Company operated and franchised restaurants only to later reinstitute them due to a rise in the number of people contracting and being treated for COVID-19. As dining room restrictions ease, we expect to incur increased cleaning and supply costs and labor inefficiencies as we adjust to improved sales volumes and enhanced health and safety protocols. We may not be able to attract customers to our reopened restaurants given the risks, or perceived risks, of gathering in public places, dining in restaurants and complying with social distancing and/or depressed consumer sentiment due to adverse economic conditions, including job losses, among other things. We also may be unable to reinstate, retain and incentivize our employees. Previously terminated or furloughed employees may have found other jobs or otherwise be unwilling or unable to return to work. Even as restaurants resume operations, a single case of COVID-19 in a restaurant could result in additional costs and further closures, or recurrences of COVID-19 cases could cause state and local governments to reinstate restrictions on our restaurants, as we have seen recently, and we may need to temporarily close our restaurants or otherwise limit operations.\nWhile we currently intend for all Company owned restaurants to reopen, certain Company operated and franchised restaurants may remain permanently closed or ultimately close as a result of the pandemic. The effects of the pandemic on our business could be long-lasting and could continue to have adverse effects on our business, results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and financial condition, some of which may be significant, and may adversely impact our ability to operate our business on the same terms as we conducted business prior to the pandemic even after our restaurants fully reopen.\nRisks Related to Restaurant Operations and the Restaurant Industry\nThe restaurant business is highly competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business will be adversely affected.\nEach of our company and franchised restaurants competes with a wide variety of restaurants ranging from national and regional restaurant chains to locally owned restaurants. The following are important aspects of competition:\n\u2022restaurant location;\n\u2022advantageous commercial real estate suitable for restaurants;\n\u2022number and location of competing restaurants;\n\u2022attractiveness and repair and maintenance of facilities;\n\u2022ability to develop and support evolving technology to deliver a consistent and compelling guest experience;\n\u2022food quality, new product development and value;\n\u2022dietary trends, including nutritional content;\n\u2022training, courtesy and hospitality standards;\n\u2022ability to attract and retain high quality staff;\n\u2022quality and speed of service; and\n\u2022the effectiveness of marketing and advertising programs, including the effective use of social media platforms and digital marketing initiatives.\nOur returns and profitability may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including those described below.\nFood service businesses and the performance of company and franchised restaurants may be materially and adversely affected by factors such as:\n\u2022consumer preferences, including nutritional and dietary concerns;\n\u2022consumer spending habits;\n\u2022global, national, regional and local economic conditions;\n\u2022demographic trends;\n\u2022traffic patterns;\n\u2022the type, number and location of competing restaurants; and\n\u2022the ability to renew leased properties on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.\nDependence on frequent deliveries of fresh produce and other food products subjects food service businesses to the risk that shortages or interruptions in supply caused by adverse weather, food safety warnings, animal disease outbreak or other conditions beyond our control could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients. Our inability to effectively manage supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products critical to restaurant operations.\nIn addition, the food service industry in general, and our results of operations and financial condition in particular, may be adversely affected by unfavorable trends or developments such as:\n\u2022volatility in certain commodity markets;\n\u2022increased food costs;\n\u2022health concerns arising from food safety issues and other food-related pandemics, outbreaks of flu or viruses, such as coronavirus, or other diseases;\n\u2022increased energy costs;\n\u2022labor and employee benefits costs (including increases in minimum hourly wage, employment tax rates, health care costs and workers\u2019 compensation costs);\n\u2022regional weather conditions;\n\u2022the availability of experienced management and hourly employees; and\n\u2022other general inflation impacts.\nOperating results that are lower than our current estimates may cause us to incur impairment charges on certain long-lived assets and potentially close certain restaurants.\nThe financial performance of our franchisees can negatively impact our business.\nAs we are heavily franchised, our financial results are contingent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees. We receive royalties, advertising contributions and, in some cases, lease payments from our franchisees. While our franchise agreements are designed to require our franchisees to maintain brand consistency, the significant percentage of franchise-operated restaurants may expose us to risks not otherwise encountered if we maintained ownership and control of the restaurants. If our franchisees do not successfully operate their restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards, or if customers have negative experiences due to issues with food quality or operational execution at our franchised locations, our brand could be harmed, which in turn could negatively impact our business. Additional risks include:\n\u2022franchisee defaults on their obligations to us arising from financial or other difficulties encountered by them, such as the inability to pay financial obligations including royalties, rent on leases on which we retain contingent liability, and certain loans;\n\u2022limitations on enforcement of franchisee obligations due to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings;\n\u2022the inability to participate in business strategy changes due to financial constraints;\n\u2022failure to operate restaurants in accordance with required standards, including food quality and safety;\n\u2022and impacts of the financial performance of other businesses operated by franchisees on the overall financial performance and condition of the franchisee.\nIf a significant number of franchisees become financially distressed, it could harm our operating results. For 2020, our ten largest franchisees accounted for approximately 39% of our total franchise and license revenue. The balance of our franchise revenue was derived from the remaining 217 franchisees.\nFood safety and quality concerns may negatively impact our business and profitability.\nIncidents or reports of foodborne or waterborne illness, or other food safety issues, food contamination or tampering, employee hygiene and cleanliness failures, improper employee conduct, or presence of communicable disease at our restaurants or suppliers could lead to product liability or other claims. Such incidents or reports could negatively affect our brand and reputation, and a decrease in customer traffic resulting from these reports could negatively impact our revenues and profits. Similar incidents or reports occurring at other restaurant brands unrelated to us could likewise create negative publicity, which could negatively impact consumer behavior towards us. In addition, if a regional or global health pandemic occurs, depending upon its location, duration and severity, our business could be severely affected.\nWe rely on our domestic and international vendors, as do our franchisees, to provide quality ingredients and to comply with applicable laws and industry standards. A failure of one of our domestic or international vendors to meet our quality standards,\nor meet domestic or international food industry standards, could result in a disruption in our supply chain and negatively impact our brand and our business and profitability. Our inability to manage an event such as a product recall or product related litigation could also cause our results to suffer.\nUnfavorable publicity, or a failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity, could harm our brand\u2019s reputation.\nMulti-unit food service businesses such as ours can be materially and adversely affected by widespread negative publicity of any type, including food safety, outbreak of flu or viruses (such as coronavirus) or other health concerns, criminal activity, guest discrimination, harassment, employee relations or other operating issues. The increasing use of social media platforms has increased the speed and scope of unfavorable publicity and could hinder our ability to quickly and effectively respond to such reports. Regardless of whether the allegations or complaints are accurate or valid, negative publicity relating to a particular restaurant or a limited number of restaurants could adversely affect public perception of the entire brand.\nA decline in general economic conditions could adversely affect our financial results.\nConsumer spending habits, including discretionary spending on dining at restaurants such as ours, are affected by many factors including:\n\u2022prevailing economic conditions, including interest rates;\n\u2022energy costs, especially gasoline prices;\n\u2022levels of employment;\n\u2022salaries and wage rates, including tax rates; and\n\u2022consumer confidence.\nWeakness or uncertainty regarding the economy, both domestic and international, as a result of reactions to consumer credit availability, increasing energy prices, inflation, increasing interest rates, unemployment, war, terrorist activity or other unforeseen events could adversely affect consumer spending habits, which may result in lower operating revenue.\nIf we fail to recruit, develop and retain talented employees, our business could suffer.\nOur future success significantly depends on the continued services and performance of our key management personnel. Our future performance will depend on our ability to attract, motivate and retain these and other key officers and key team members, particularly regional and area managers and restaurant general managers. Competition for these employees is intense.\nRisks Related to Development Strategies\nOur growth strategy depends on our ability and that of our franchisees to open new restaurants. Delays or failures in opening new restaurants could adversely affect our planned growth and operating results.\nThe development of new restaurants may be adversely affected by risks such as:\n\u2022inability to identify suitable franchisees;\n\u2022costs and availability of capital for the Company and/or franchisees;\n\u2022competition for restaurant sites;\n\u2022negotiation of favorable purchase or lease terms for restaurant sites;\n\u2022inability to obtain all required governmental approvals and permits;\n\u2022delays in completion of construction;\n\u2022challenge of identifying, recruiting and training qualified restaurant managers;\n\u2022developed restaurants not achieving the expected revenue or cash flow once opened;\n\u2022challenges specific to the growth of international operations that are different from domestic development; and\n\u2022general economic conditions.\nThe locations of company and franchised restaurants may cease to be attractive as demographic patterns change.\nThe success of our company and franchised restaurants is significantly influenced by location. Current locations may not continue to be attractive as demographic patterns change. It is possible that the neighborhood or economic conditions where restaurants are located could decline in the future, potentially resulting in reduced sales at those locations.\nOur expansion into international markets may present increased risks due to lower customer awareness of our brand, our unfamiliarity with those markets and other factors.\nThe international markets in which our franchisees currently operate, and any additional markets our franchisees may enter outside of the United States, have many differences compared to our domestic markets. There may be lower consumer familiarity with the Denny\u2019s brand in these markets, as well as different competitive conditions, consumer tastes and economic, political and health conditions. Additionally, there are risks associated with sourcing quality ingredients and other commodities in a cost-effective and timely manner. As a result, franchised international restaurants may take longer to reach expected sales and profit levels, or may never do so, thereby affecting the brand\u2019s overall growth and profitability. Building brand awareness may take longer than expected, which could negatively impact our profitability in those markets.\nWe are subject to governmental regulations in our international markets impacting the way we do business with our international franchisees. These include antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, import/export/customs and other international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nLegal, Information Technology and Regulatory Risks\nLitigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the risk of, or are involved in from time to time, complaints or litigation brought by former, current or prospective employees, customers, franchisees, vendors, landlords, shareholders or others. We assess contingencies to determine the degree of probability and range of possible loss for potential accrual in our financial statements. An estimated loss contingency is accrued if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Because lawsuits are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. We regularly review contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures. However, the amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates. A judgment that is not covered by insurance or that is significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend, and may divert management\u2019s attention away from operations and hurt our performance. Further, adverse publicity resulting from claims may harm our business or that of our franchisees.\nOur amended and restated by-laws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur amended and restated by-laws provide that consistent with the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), unless our Board of Directors, acting on behalf of the Company, consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any and all internal corporate claims, including but not limited to:\n\u2022any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u2022any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any stockholder, director, officer, other employee or stockholder of the Company to us or our stockholders;\n\u2022any action arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and\n\u2022any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThese provisions would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) or any claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America have exclusive jurisdiction. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims.\nOur stockholders cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions of our amended and restated by-laws described in the preceding sentences.\nWhile the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than that designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated by-laws. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions.\nThis choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees. If any other court of competent jurisdiction were to find the exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated by-laws to be inapplicable or unenforceable, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions.\nNumerous government regulations impact our business, and our failure to comply with them could adversely affect our business.\nWe and our franchisees are subject to federal, state, local and international laws and regulations governing, among other things:\n\u2022preparation, labeling, advertising and sale of food;\n\u2022sanitation;\n\u2022health and fire safety;\n\u2022land use, sign restrictions and environmental matters;\n\u2022employee health care requirements, including the implementation and uncertain legal, regulatory and cost implications of the health care reform law;\n\u2022management and protection of the personnel data of our guests, employees and franchisees;\n\u2022payment card regulation and related industry rules;\n\u2022the sale of alcoholic beverages;\n\u2022hiring and employment practices, including minimum wage and tip credit laws and fair labor standards; and\n\u2022Americans with Disabilities Act.\nA substantial number of our employees are paid the minimum wage. Accordingly, increases in the minimum wage or decreases in the allowable tip credit (which reduces wages deemed to be paid to tipped employees in certain states) increase our labor costs. We have attempted to offset increases in the minimum wage through pricing and various cost control efforts; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts in the future.\nThe operation of our franchisee system is also subject to regulations enacted by a number of states and rules promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission. Due to our international franchising, we are subject to governmental regulations throughout the world impacting the way we do business with our international franchisees. These include antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, import/export/customs and other international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Additionally, given our significant concentration of restaurants in California, changes in regulations in that state could have a disproportionate impact on our operations. If we or our franchisees fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we or our franchisees could be subjected to restaurant closure, fines, penalties and litigation, which may be costly and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the future enactment of additional legislation regulating the franchise relationship could adversely affect our operations.\nWe have implemented various aspects of The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act. However, the law or other related requirements may change.\nWe are also subject to federal, state, local and international laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. Such laws impose registration and disclosure requirements on franchisors in the offer and sale of franchises, and may contain provisions that supersede the terms of franchise agreements, including limitations on the ability of franchisors to terminate franchises and alter franchise arrangements.\nFailure of computer systems, information technology, or the ability to provide a continuously secure network, or cyber attacks against our computer systems, could result in material harm to our reputation and business.\nWe and our franchisees rely heavily on computer systems and information technology to conduct our business and operate efficiently. We have instituted monitoring controls intended to protect our computer systems, our point-of-sale systems and our information technology platforms and networks against external threats. Those controls include an annual proactive risk assessment, advanced comprehensive analysis of data threats, identification of business email compromise and proper security awareness education. The Audit & Finance Committee of our Board of Directors has oversight responsibility related to our\ncybersecurity risk management programs and periodically reviews reports on cybersecurity metrics, data privacy and other information technology risks.\nWe receive and maintain certain personal information about our guests, employees and franchisees. Our use of this information is subject to international, federal and state regulations, as well as conditions included in certain third-party contracts. If our cybersecurity is compromised and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affect our reputation, operations, results of operations and financial condition, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. As privacy and information security laws and regulations change or cyber risks evolve, we may incur additional costs to ensure we remain compliant.\nA material system failure or interruption, a breach in the security of our information technology systems caused by a cyber attack, or other failure to maintain a secure cyber network could result in reduced efficiency in our operations, loss or misappropriation of data, business interruptions, or could impact delivery of food to restaurants or financial functions such as vendor payment or employee payroll. We have disaster recovery and business continuity plans that are designed to anticipate and mitigate such failures, but it is possible that significant capital investment could be required to rectify these problems, or more likely that cash flows could be impacted, in the shorter term.\nWe rely on third parties for certain business processes and services. Failure or inability of such third-party vendors to perform subjects us to risks, including business disruption and increased costs.\nWe depend on suppliers and other third parties for the operation of certain aspects of our business. Some third-party business processes we utilize include information technology, payment processing, gift card authorization and processing, benefits, delivery and other business services. We conduct third-party due diligence and seek to obtain contractual assurance that our vendors will maintain adequate controls, such as adequate security against data breaches. However, the failure of our suppliers to maintain adequate controls or comply with our expectations and standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf our internal controls are ineffective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We maintain a documented system of internal controls which is reviewed and tested by the Company\u2019s full time Internal Audit department. The Internal Audit department reports directly to the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. A significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock.\nA change in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported financial results. New pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing accounting rules or the questioning of current accounting practices may adversely affect our reported financial results. Additionally, generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by us. Changes in these principles or their interpretations or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates and judgments by us could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance.\nRisks Related to Indebtedness\nChanges in the method used to determine LIBOR rates and the potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may affect our financial results.\nBorrowings under our credit facility bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR. In addition, we have interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges of our exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to payments of LIBOR due on forecasted notional debt obligations. LIBOR and certain other interest \u201cbenchmarks\u201d may be subject to regulatory guidance and/or reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements and interest rate swaps to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences. The United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it intends to stop encouraging or requiring banks to submit rates for the calculation\nof LIBOR after 2021, and it is unclear if LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will evolve. If LIBOR ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from their current form, interest rates on our current or future debt obligations and interest rate swaps may be adversely affected.\nOur indebtedness could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nAs of December 30, 2020, we had total indebtedness of $225.4 million, including finance leases. Although we believe that our existing cash balances, funds from operations and amounts available under our credit facility will be adequate to cover our cash flow and liquidity needs, we could seek additional sources of funds, including incurring additional debt, to maintain sufficient cash flow to fund our ongoing operating needs, pay interest and scheduled debt amortization and fund anticipated capital expenditures. We have no material debt maturities scheduled until October 2022. The credit agreement governing most of our indebtedness contains various covenants that could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger, acquisition or other corporate opportunities and to fund our operations. Restrictions under our credit agreement could also restrict our ability to repurchase shares in the future. If we incur additional debt in the future, covenant limitations on our activities and risks associated with such increased debt levels generally could increase. If we are unable to satisfy or refinance our current debt as it comes due, we may default on our debt obligations and lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. For additional information concerning our indebtedness see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nMany factors, including those over which we have no control, affect the trading price of our common stock.\nFactors such as reports on the economy or the price of commodities, as well as negative or positive announcements by competitors, regardless of whether the report directly relates to our business, could have an impact on the trading price of our common stock. In addition to investor expectations about our prospects, trading activity in our common stock can reflect the portfolio strategies and investment allocation changes of institutional holders, as well as non-operating initiatives such as our share repurchase programs. Any failure to meet market expectations whether for same-store sales, restaurant unit growth, earnings per share or other metrics could cause our share price to decline.", "PERMNO": 85726, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "DENN"}
