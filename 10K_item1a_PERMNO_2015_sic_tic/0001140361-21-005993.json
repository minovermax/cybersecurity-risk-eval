RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or other factors not perceived by us to present significant risks to our business at this time also may impair our business and results of operations. If any of the stated risks actually occur, they could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe depend on a limited number of key customers, and the loss of any such customer, or a significant reduction in purchases by such customer, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur five largest individual customers accounted for approximately 68% of our consolidated net sales in 2020, approximately 69% of our consolidated net sales in 2019, and approximately 70% of our consolidated net sales in 2018. During 2020, O\u2019Reilly, NAPA, Advance and AutoZone accounted for 26%, 15%, 14% and 11% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. The loss of one or more of these customers or, a significant reduction in purchases of our products from any one of them, could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any consolidation among our key customers may further increase our customer concentration risk.\nIn December 2020, a large retail customer informed us of its decision to pursue a private brand strategy for its engine management product line. This customer has historically purchased $140 million of engine management products annually from us. We anticipate that sales to this customer will continue through the first quarter of 2021. In light of this development, we plan to take the necessary steps to reduce costs.\nIndex\nAlso, we do not typically enter into long-term agreements with any of our customers. Instead, we enter into a number of purchase order commitments with our customers, based on their current or projected needs. We have in the past, and may in the future, lose customers or lose a particular product line of a customer due to the highly competitive conditions in the automotive aftermarket industry, including pricing pressures, consolidation of customers, customer initiatives to buy direct from foreign suppliers and/or to pursue a private brand strategy, or other business considerations. A decision by any significant customer, whether motivated by competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to materially decrease the amount of products purchased from us, to change their manner of doing business with us, or to stop doing business with us, including a decision to source products directly from a low cost region such as Asia, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause our sales are concentrated, and the market in which we operate is very competitive, we are under ongoing pressure from our customers to offer lower prices, extend payment terms, increase marketing allowances and other terms more favorable to these customers. These customer demands have put continued pressure on our operating margins and profitability, resulted in periodic contract renegotiation to provide more favorable prices and terms to these customers, and significantly increased our working capital needs.\nOur industry is highly competitive, and our success depends on our ability to compete with suppliers of automotive aftermarket products, some of which may have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do.\nThe automotive aftermarket industry is highly competitive, and our success depends on our ability to compete with domestic and international suppliers of automotive aftermarket products. In the Engine Management Segment, we compete with: ACDelco, Aptive Plc, Denso Corporation, Continental AG, Hitachi, Ltd., Motorcraft, Robert Bosch GmbH, Visteon Corporation, NGK Spark Plug Co., LTD., Dorman Products, Inc. and several privately-owned companies primarily importing products from Asia. In the Temperature Control Segment, we compete with: ACDelco, MAHLE GmbH, Denso Corporation, Motorcraft, Sanden International (U.S.A.), Inc., Continental AG, Dorman Products, Inc., and several privately-owned companies. In addition, automobile manufacturers supply many of the replacement parts we sell.\nSome of our competitors may have larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. These factors may allow our competitors to:\n\u2022 respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements by devoting greater resources than we can to the development, promotion and sale of automotive aftermarket products and services;\n\u2022 engage in more extensive research and development;\n\u2022 sell products at a lower price than we do;\n\u2022 undertake more extensive marketing campaigns; and\n\u2022 make more attractive offers to existing and potential customers and strategic partners.\nWe cannot assure you that our competitors will not develop products or services that are equal or superior to our products or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products or that in the future other companies involved in the automotive aftermarket industry will not expand their operations into product lines produced and sold by us. We also cannot assure you that additional entrants will not enter the automotive aftermarket industry or that companies in the aftermarket industry will not consolidate. Any such competitive pressures could cause us to lose market share or could result in significant price decreases and could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIndex\nThere is substantial price competition in our industry, and our success and profitability will depend on our ability to maintain a competitive cost and price structure.\nThere is substantial price competition in our industry, and our success and profitability will depend on our ability to maintain a competitive cost and price structure. This is the result of a number of industry trends, including the impact of offshore suppliers in the marketplace (particularly in China) which do not have the same infrastructure costs as we do, the consolidated purchasing power of large customers, and actions taken by some of our competitors in an effort to \u2018\u2018win over\u2019\u2019 new business. We have in the past reduced prices to remain competitive and may have to do so again in the future. Price reductions have impacted our sales and profit margins and are expected to do so in the future. Our future profitability will depend in part upon our ability to respond to changes in product and distribution channel mix, to continue to improve our manufacturing efficiencies, to generate cost reductions, including reductions in the cost of components purchased from outside suppliers, and to maintain a cost structure that will enable us to offer competitive prices. Our inability to maintain a competitive cost structure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is seasonal and is subject to substantial quarterly fluctuations, which impact our quarterly performance and working capital requirements.\nHistorically, our operating results have fluctuated by quarter, with the greatest sales occurring in the second and third quarters of the year and with revenues generally being recognized at the time of shipment. It is in these quarters that demand for our products is typically the highest, specifically in the Temperature Control Segment of our business. In addition to this seasonality, the demand for our Temperature Control products during the second and third quarters of the year may vary significantly with the summer weather and customer inventories. Ordinarily, a warm summer, as we experienced in 2020, would increase the demand for our temperature control products, while a somewhat mild summer, as we experienced in 2019, may lessen such demand. As a result of this seasonality and variability in demand of our Temperature Control products, our working capital requirements peak near the end of the second quarter, as the inventory build-up of air conditioning products is converted to sales and payments on the receivables associated with such sales have yet to be received. During this period, our working capital requirements are typically funded by borrowing from our revolving credit facility.\nWe may incur material losses and significant costs as a result of warranty-related returns by our customers in excess of anticipated amounts.\nOur products are required to meet rigorous standards imposed by our customers and our industry. Many of our products carry a warranty ranging from a 90-day limited warranty to a lifetime limited warranty, which generally covers defects in materials or workmanship, failure to meet industry published specifications and/or the result of installation error. In the event that there are material deficiencies or defects in the design and manufacture of our products and/or installation error, the affected products may be subject to warranty returns and/or product recalls. Although we maintain a comprehensive quality control program, we cannot give any assurance that our products will not suffer from defects or other deficiencies or that we will not experience material warranty returns or product recalls in the future.\nWe accrue for warranty returns as a percentage of sales, after giving consideration to recent historical returns. While we believe that we make reasonable estimates for warranty returns in accordance with our revenue recognition policies, actual returns may differ from our estimates. We have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, material losses and significant costs as a result of our customers returning products to us for warranty-related issues in excess of anticipated amounts. Deficiencies or defects in our products in the future may result in warranty returns and product recalls in excess of anticipated amounts and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur profitability may be materially adversely affected as a result of overstock inventory-related returns by our customers in excess of anticipated amounts.\nWe permit overstock returns of inventory that may be either new or non-defective or non-obsolete but that we believe we can re-sell. Customers are generally limited to returning overstocked inventory according to a specified percentage of their annual purchases from us. In addition, a customer\u2019s annual allowance cannot be carried forward to the upcoming year.\nIndex\nWe accrue for overstock returns as a percentage of sales, after giving consideration to recent historical returns. While we believe that we make reasonable estimates for overstock returns in accordance with our revenue recognition policies, actual returns may differ from our estimates. To the extent that overstocked returns are materially in excess of our projections, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be materially adversely affected by asbestos claims arising from products sold by our former brake business, as well as by other product liability claims.\nIn 1986, we acquired a brake business, which we subsequently sold in March 1998. When we originally acquired this brake business, we assumed future liabilities relating to any alleged exposure to asbestos-containing products manufactured by the seller of the acquired brake business. In accordance with the related purchase agreement, we agreed to assume the liabilities for all new claims filed after September 2001. Our ultimate exposure will depend upon the number of claims filed against us on or after September 2001, and the amounts paid for settlements, awards of asbestos-related damages, and defense of such claims. We do not have insurance coverage for the indemnity and defense costs associated with the claims we face.\nAt December 31, 2020, approximately 1,560 cases were outstanding for which we may be responsible for any related liabilities. Since inception in September 2001 through December 31, 2020, the amounts paid for settled claims and awards of asbestos-related damages, including interest, were approximately $48.3 million. A substantial increase in the number of new claims, or increased settlement payments, or awards of asbestos-related damages, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn accordance with our policy to perform an annual actuarial evaluation in the third quarter of each year, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that additional provisions may be necessary, an actuarial study was performed as of August 31, 2020. Additionally, in December 2020, an updated actuarial study was performed to reflect events that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2020. Based upon the results of the actuarial studies performed in 2020, we increased our asbestos liability to the low end of the range, and recorded an incremental pre-tax provision of $25.7 million in earnings (loss) from discontinued operations in the accompanying statement of operations. The results of the updated study included an estimate of our undiscounted liability for settlement payments and awards of asbestos-related damages, excluding legal costs and any potential recovery from insurance carriers, ranging from $63 million to $99.1 million for the period through 2065. Future legal costs, which are expensed as incurred and reported in earnings (loss) from discontinued operations in the accompanying statement of operations, are estimated, according to the updated study, to range from $48.7 million to $95.4 million.\nGiven the uncertainties associated with projecting asbestos-related matters into the future and other factors outside our control, we cannot give any assurance that significant increases in the number of claims filed against us will not occur, that awards of asbestos-related damages or settlement awards will not exceed the amount we have in reserve, or that additional provisions will not be required. Management will continue to monitor the circumstances surrounding these potential liabilities in determining whether additional reserves and provisions may be necessary. We plan on performing an annual actuarial analysis during the third quarter of each year for the foreseeable future, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that additional provisions may be necessary.\nIn addition to asbestos-related claims, our product sales entail the risk of involvement in other product liability actions. We maintain product liability insurance coverage, but we cannot give any assurance that current or future policy limits will be sufficient to cover all possible liabilities. Further, we can give no assurance that adequate product liability insurance will continue to be available to us in the future or that such insurance may be maintained at a reasonable cost to us. In the event of a successful product liability claim against us, a lack or insufficiency of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIndex\nWe may not be able to achieve the benefits that we expect from our cost savings initiatives.\nWe expect to realize cost savings as a result of various cost reduction measures implemented in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and the loss of a large retail customer in the engine management product line, and several recently completed initiatives, including the plant rationalization programs implemented in February 2016 and January 2017. Due to factors outside our control, such as the adoption or modification of domestic and foreign laws, regulations or policies, we may not be able to achieve the level of benefits that we expect to realize in these initiatives, or we may not be able to realize these benefits within the time frames we currently expect. Our ability to achieve any anticipated cost savings could be affected by a number of factors such as changes in the amount, timing and character of charges related to such initiatives, or a substantial delay in the completion of such initiatives. Failure to achieve the benefits of our cost saving initiatives could have a material adverse effect on us. Our cost savings is also predicated upon maintaining our sales levels.\nSevere weather, natural disasters and other disruptions could adversely impact our operations at our manufacturing and distribution facilities.\nSevere weather conditions and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods and tornados, could damage our properties and effect our operations, particularly our major manufacturing and distribution operations at foreign facilities in Canada, Mexico and Poland, and at our domestic facilities in Florida, Indiana, Kansas, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. In addition, our business and operations could be materially adversely affected in the event of other serious disruptions at these facilities due to fire, electrical blackouts, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attack or similar events. Any of these occurrences could impair our ability to adequately manufacture or supply our customers due to all or a significant portion of our equipment or inventory being damaged. We may not be able to effectively shift the manufacture or delivery of products to our customers if one or more of our manufacturing or distribution facilities are significantly disrupted.\nOur operations would be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to purchase raw materials, manufactured components or equipment from our suppliers.\nBecause we purchase various types of raw materials, finished goods, equipment, and component parts from suppliers as part of a global supply chain, we may be materially and adversely affected by the failure of those suppliers to perform as expected. Supplier non-performance may consist of delivery delays or failures caused by production issues or delivery of non-conforming products. Our suppliers\u2019 ability to supply products to us is also subject to a number of risks, including the availability and cost of raw materials, the destruction of their facilities, or work stoppages, or other limitations on their business operations, which could be caused by any number of factors, such as labor disruptions, financial distress, severe weather conditions and natural disasters, social unrest, economic and political instability, and public health crises, including the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, war, terrorism or other catastrophic events. In addition, our failure to promptly pay, or order sufficient quantities of inventory from our suppliers may increase the cost of products we purchase or may lead to suppliers refusing to sell products to us at all. Our efforts to protect against and to minimize these risks may not always be effective.\nIndex\nOur operations could be adversely affected by interruptions or breaches in the security of our computer and information technology systems.\nWe rely on information technology systems throughout our organization to conduct day-to-day business operations, including the management of our supply chain and our purchasing, receiving and distribution functions. We also routinely use our information technology systems to send, receive, store, access and use sensitive data relating to our Company and its employees, customers, suppliers, and business partners, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, and other sensitive materials. Additionally, we rely on our information technology systems to enable many of our employees to work remotely as a result of new policies and practices enacted by us in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our information technology systems have been subject to cyber threats, including attempts to hack into our network and computer viruses. Such hacking attempts and computer viruses have not significantly impacted or interrupted our business operations. While we implement security measures designed to prevent and mitigate the risk of cyber attacks, our information technology systems, and the systems of our customers, suppliers and business partners, may continue to be vulnerable to computer viruses, attacks by hackers, or unauthorized access caused by employee error or malfeasance. The exploitation of any such vulnerability could unexpectedly compromise our information security, or the security of our customers, suppliers and other business partners. Furthermore, because the techniques used to carry out cyber attacks change frequently and in many instances are not recognized until after they are used against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these changes or implement adequate preventative measures. If our information technology systems, or the systems of our customers, suppliers or business partners, are subject to cyber attacks, such as those involving significant or extensive system interruptions, sabotage, computer viruses or unauthorized access, we could experience disruptions to our business operations and incur substantial remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to maintain the value of our brands could have an adverse effect on our reputation, cause us to incur significant costs and negatively impact our business.\nOur brands are an important component of our value proposition, and serve to distinguish our premium engine management and temperature control products from those of our competitors. We believe that our success depends, in part, on maintaining and enhancing the value of our brands and executing our brand strategies, which are designed to drive end-user demand for our products and make us a valued business partner to our customers through the support of their marketing initiatives. A decline in the reputation of our brands as a result of events, such as deficiencies or defects in the design or manufacture of our products, or from legal proceedings, product recalls or warranty claims resulting from such deficiencies or defects, may harm our reputation as a manufacturer and distributor of premium automotive parts, reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Liquidity\nWe are exposed to risks related to our receivables supply chain financing arrangements.\nWe are party to several supply chain financing arrangements, in which we may sell certain of our customers\u2019 trade accounts receivable without recourse to such customers\u2019 financial institutions. To the extent that these arrangements are terminated, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected by extended payment terms, delays or failures in collecting trade accounts receivables. The utility of the supply chain financing arrangements also depends upon the LIBOR rate, as it is a component of the discount rate applicable to each arrangement. If the LIBOR rate increases significantly, we may be negatively impacted as we may not be able to pass these added costs on to our customers, which could have a material and adverse effect upon our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreasing our indebtedness could negatively affect our financial health.\nWe have an existing revolving bank credit facility of $250 million with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent, and a syndicate of lenders, which we refer to throughout this Report as our revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2020, our total outstanding indebtedness was $10.2 million, of which amount $10 million of outstanding indebtedness and approximately $237.1 million of availability was attributable to this revolving credit facility. Any significant increase in our indebtedness could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate.\nAvailability under our revolving credit facility is based on a formula of eligible accounts receivable, eligible drafts presented to financial institutions under our supply chain financing arrangements and eligible inventory. The loss of business of one or more of our key customers or, a significant reduction in purchases of our products from any one of them, could adversely impact availability under our revolving credit facility. Based upon our availability under the revolving credit agreement at December 31, 2020, the pending loss of business as a result of a large retail customer's decision to pursue a private brand strategy will not significantly impact our availability and/or liquidity as we enter into 2021.\nIndex\nIn addition, we have granted the lenders under our revolving credit facility a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets, including accounts receivable, inventory and certain fixed assets, and those of certain of our subsidiaries. We have also pledged shares of stock in our subsidiaries to those lenders. If we default on any of our indebtedness, or if we are unable to obtain necessary liquidity, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to generate the significant amount of cash needed to service our indebtedness and fund our future operations.\nOur ability either to make payments on or to refinance our indebtedness, or to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our ability to generate cash is in part subject to:\n\u2022 general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control;\n\u2022 the ability of our customers to pay timely the amounts we have billed; and\n\u2022 our ability to sell receivables under supply chain financing arrangements.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing factors could result in reduced cash flow, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nBased on our current level of operations, we believe our cash flow from operations, available cash and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months. Significant assumptions underlie this belief, including, among other things, that there will be no material adverse developments in our business, liquidity or capital requirements. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, we will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include actions such as:\n\u2022 deferring, reducing or eliminating future cash dividends;\n\u2022 reducing or delaying capital expenditures or restructuring activities;\n\u2022 reducing or delaying research and development efforts;\n\u2022 selling assets;\n\u2022 deferring or refraining from pursuing certain strategic initiatives and acquisitions;\n\u2022 refinancing our indebtedness; and\n\u2022 seeking additional funding.\nWe cannot assure you that, if material adverse developments in our business, liquidity or capital requirements should occur, our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our revolving credit facility in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs. In addition, if we default on any of our indebtedness, or breach any financial covenant in our revolving credit facility, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe proposed phase-out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) could materially impact our borrowing costs under our secured revolving credit facility or the utility of our supply chain financing arrangements.\nOur secured revolving credit facility and certain of our supply chain financing arrangements utilize LIBOR for the purpose of determining the interest rate on certain borrowings or the discount rate on the sale of trade accounts receivable, respectively. In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that, after the end of 2021, it would no longer compel contributing banks to make rate submissions for the purposes of setting LIBOR. As a result, it is possible that commencing in 2022, LIBOR may cease to be available or may cease to be deemed an appropriate reference rate, and we may need to amend our credit agreement and supply chain financing arrangements to utilize an alternative reference rate based on the then prevailing market convention at the time. Although we do not believe that the proposed phase-out of LIBOR will materially impact our business, financial condition or results of operations, we can provide no assurances that any such alternative reference rate will be similar to LIBOR, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of LIBOR, or have the same volume or liquidity as LIBOR prior to its discontinuance.\nIndex\nRisks Related to External Factors\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the effects of widespread public health crises, including the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, that are beyond our control.\nThe global outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption in many countries in which we operate, including the United States, Mexico, Canada, Poland, the U.K. and China, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Ultimately, the duration and severity of the pandemic may vary depending on the characteristics of the virus and the public health response; therefore, the nature and extent of its impact on our business and operations may be uncertain and beyond our control. Customer demand for our products and customer preferences regarding product mix and distribution channels could be impacted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and significant uncertainty exists with respect to the potential future impact of the pandemic as well as a deterioration of general economic conditions, including high unemployment and a possible national or global recession.\nIf customer demand were to decrease in future periods, or if customer preferences regarding product mix and distribution channels were to change, we may be required to adjust and reduce production volumes and implement cost reduction and cash preservation initiatives, including potential reductions in capital expenditures and employee furloughs, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn certain countries in which we operate, national, state and local governments implemented a variety of measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including by declaring states of emergency, restricting people from gathering in groups or interacting within a certain physical distance (i.e., social distancing), restricting or limiting the operations of businesses deemed to be non-essential, and imposing travel restrictions on individuals, including restrictions requiring individuals to stay at their place of residence except to perform certain activities deemed to be essential. In certain jurisdictions, these governmental measures have been eased through planned, phased in \u201cre-openings;\u201d however, in other jurisdictions, re-opening plans have been subsequently paused or reversed in response to an increase in the number of new COVID-19 cases. Although we have been able to continue to perform, with certain modifications, all of the material operations at all of our principal facilities, we can provide no assurances that we will be able to continue to perform such operations in the future without disruption, such as temporary closures, as a result of new or modifications to existing governmental measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Any restrictions or limitations on our ability to perform such operations in the future without disruption, such as temporary closures, as a result of governmental measures in response to the pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could cause material disruptions to our business and operations as a result of worker absenteeism due to illness or other factors, and the implementation of various exposure-reducing and infection prevention measures, such as facility modifications, updated policies for high risk employees, work-from-home allowances, cleaning and disinfecting measures, social distancing, staggered work shifts and reduced operations and production volumes. We have had to temporarily suspend operations to clean and disinfect areas within our facilities where employees, who later tested positive or exhibited symptoms of COVID-19 performed work. Depending on the extent and duration of these disruptions, and their effects on our business and operations, our costs could increase, including our costs to address the health and safety of our employees, our ability to manufacture and distribute product to satisfy demand for our products could be adversely impacted and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nFurthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on the business, operations and financial condition of our customers, suppliers and other supply chain partners as a result of the governmental measures described above, disruptions to their business and operations for reasons similar to those described above, and their ability to manage and mitigate the adverse effects of these and other risks unique to their business and operations that may arise as a result of the pandemic.\nIndex\nWe conduct our manufacturing and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to risks associated with doing business outside the United States.\nWe have manufacturing and distribution facilities in many countries, including Canada, Poland, Mexico and China, and increasing our manufacturing footprint in low cost regions is an important element of our strategy. There are a number of risks associated with doing business internationally, including: (a) exposure to local economic and political conditions; (b) social unrest such as risks of terrorism or other hostilities; (c) currency exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls; (d) the effect of potential changes in U.S. trade policy and international trade agreements; and (e) the potential for shortages of trained labor.\nIn particular, there has been social unrest in Hong Kong and Mexico and any increased violence in or around our facilities in such countries could be disruptive to our business operations at such facilities, or present risks to our employees who may be directly affected by the violence and may result in a decision by them to relocate from the area, or make it difficult for us to recruit or retain talented employees at such facilities.\nFurthermore, changes in U.S. trade policy, particularly as it relates to China, have resulted in the assessment of increased tariffs on goods that we import into the United States, and have caused uncertainty about the future of free trade generally. We benefit from free trade agreements, such as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). The repeal or modification of the USMCA or further increases to tariffs on goods imported into the United States could increase our costs to source materials, component parts and finished goods from other countries. The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us is unpredictable and may vary from country to country. Any such occurrences could be harmful to our business and our financial results.\nWe may incur liabilities under government regulations and environmental laws, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDomestic and foreign political developments and government regulations and policies directly affect automotive consumer products in the United States and abroad. Regulations and policies relating to over-the-highway vehicles include standards established by the United States Department of Transportation for motor vehicle safety and emissions. The modification of existing laws, regulations or policies, or the adoption of new laws, regulations or policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations and properties are subject to a wide variety of increasingly complex and stringent federal, state, local and international laws and regulations, including those governing the use, storage, handling, generation, treatment, emission, release, discharge and disposal of materials, substances and wastes, the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater and the health and safety of employees. Such environmental laws, including but not limited to those under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation & Liability Act, may impose joint and several liability and may apply to conditions at properties presently or formerly owned or operated by an entity or its predecessors, as well as to conditions at properties at which wastes or other contamination attributable to an entity or its predecessors have been sent or otherwise come to be located.\nThe nature of our operations exposes us to the risk of claims with respect to such matters, and we can give no assurance that violations of such laws have not occurred or will not occur or that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with such claims. We are currently monitoring our environmental remediation efforts at one of our facilities and our reserve balance related to the environmental clean-up at this facility is $1.7 million at December 31, 2020. The environmental testing and any remediation costs at such facility may be covered by several insurance policies, although we can give no assurance that our insurance will cover any environmental remediation claims. We also maintain insurance to cover our existing U.S. and Canadian facilities. We can give no assurance that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental laws and the liability for known environmental claims pursuant to such environmental laws will not give rise to additional significant expenditures or liabilities that would be material to us. In addition, future events, such as new information, changes in existing environmental laws or their interpretation, and more vigorous enforcement policies of federal, state or local regulatory agencies, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIndex\nOur future performance may be materially adversely affected by changes in technologies and improvements in the quality of new vehicle parts.\nChanges in automotive technologies, such as vehicles powered by fuel cells or electricity, could negatively affect sales to our aftermarket customers. These factors could result in less demand for our products thereby causing a decline in our results of operations or deterioration in our business and financial condition and may have a material adverse effect on our long-term performance.\nIn addition, the size of the automobile replacement parts market depends, in part, upon the growth in number of vehicles on the road, increase in average vehicle age, change in total miles driven per year, new or modified environmental and vehicle safety regulations, including fuel-efficiency and emissions reduction standards, increase in pricing of new cars and new car quality and related warranties. The automobile replacement parts market has been negatively impacted by the fact that the quality of more recent automotive vehicles and their component parts (and related warranties) has improved, thereby lengthening the repair cycle. Generally, if parts last longer, there will be less demand for our products and the average useful life of automobile parts has been steadily increasing in recent years due to innovations in products and technology. In addition, the introduction by original equipment manufacturers of increased warranty and maintenance initiatives has the potential to decrease the demand for our products. When proper maintenance and repair procedures are followed, newer air conditioning (A/C) systems in particular are less prone to leak resulting in fewer A/C system repairs. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 39220, "SIC": 3690, "TIC": "SMP"}
