{"cik": "1439288", "company": "Rexnord Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-05-20", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nWe have identified the following material risks to our business. The risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or those risks we currently view to be immaterial, may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of these risks materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur debt levels could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from making debt service payments.\nWe are a highly leveraged company. As of March 31, 2015 we had $1,950.5 million of outstanding indebtedness. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt will depend on a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our debt service and other obligations, and currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements may not be realized on schedule, or at all. If we are unable to meet our expenses and debt service and other obligations, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, sell assets or raise equity. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, sell assets or raise equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur substantial indebtedness could also have other important consequences with respect to our ability to manage our business successfully, including the following:\n\u2022\nit may limit our ability to borrow money for our working capital, capital expenditures, strategic initiatives or other purposes;\n\u2022\nit may make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under our credit agreement and our other indebtedness;\n\u2022\na substantial portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the repayment of our indebtedness and so will not be available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nit may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our operations or business;\n\u2022\nwe are and will continue to be more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022\nit may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business or the economy;\n\u2022\nit may restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or divestitures, introducing new technologies or exploiting business opportunities; and\n\u2022\nit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the documents governing our indebtedness, among other things, may limit our ability to borrow additional funds, make acquisitions or capital expenditures, dispose of assets or take certain of the actions mentioned above, any of which could restrict our operations and business plans.\nFurthermore, a substantial portion of our indebtedness, including the senior secured credit facilities and borrowings outstanding under our accounts receivable securitization facility, bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain short-term prevailing interest rates. As of March 31, 2015, we had $1,905.4 million of floating rate debt under our senior secured credit facilities, of which $700 million was hedged with interest rate caps with a 3% LIBOR ceiling and $650 million was hedged with forward starting interest rate swaps with a weighted average of 2.55% (effective September 2015). The existing interest rate swaps and interest rate caps together have effectively hedged approximately 73% of our outstanding variable rate term loans with a weighted average interest rate that cannot exceed 2.79% plus the applicable margin of 3%. Our term loan facilities are subject to a 1% LIBOR floor. Therefore, a 100 basis point increase in the March 31, 2015 market interest rate would increase interest expense under the senior secured credit facilities by approximately $3.4 million on an annual basis. An additional 100 basis point increase in the LIBOR rate would add approximately $22 million of annual interest expense under our term loan facility.\nAlso, in spite of the limitations in our credit agreement, we may still incur significantly more debt, which could intensify the risks described above on our business, results and financial condition. For more information about our indebtedness, see Part II Item 8, Note 11 Long-Term Debt to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe markets in which we sell our products are highly competitive.\nWe operate in highly fragmented markets within the Process & Motion Control platform. As a result, we compete against numerous companies. Some of our competitors have achieved substantially more market penetration in certain of the markets in which we operate, and some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. Competition in our business lines is based on a number of considerations, including product performance, cost of transportation in the distribution of products, brand reputation, quality of client service and support, product availability and price. Additionally, some of our larger customers are attempting to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase in order to increase their efficiency. If we are not selected to become one of these preferred providers, we may lose access to certain sections of the markets in which we compete. Our customers increasingly demand a broad product range and we must continue to develop our expertise in order to manufacture and market these products successfully. To remain competitive, we will need to invest continuously in manufacturing, customer service and support, marketing and our distribution networks. We may also have to adjust the prices of some of our Process & Motion Control products to stay competitive. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will maintain our competitive position within each of the markets we serve.\nWithin the Water Management platform, we compete against both large international and national rivals, as well as many regional competitors. Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do. Significant competition in any of the markets in which the Water Management platform operates could result in substantial downward pressure on product pricing and our profit margins, thereby adversely affecting the Water Management financial results. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain or increase the current market share of our products successfully in the future.\nGeneral economic financial market weakness, as well as overall challenging market cycles may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nGlobal economic and financial market conditions have been weak and/or volatile in recent years, and those conditions have affected our business operations. A weakening of current conditions or a future downturn may adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition. Weak, challenging or volatile economic conditions in the end-markets, businesses or geographic areas in which we sell our products could reduce demand for products and result in a decrease in sales volume for a prolonged period of time, which would have a negative impact on our future results of operations.\nOur financial performance depends, in large part, on conditions in the markets that we serve in the U.S. and the global economy generally. Some of the industries we serve, such as the aerospace, energy and industrial equipment industries, are highly cyclical. We have undertaken cost reduction programs as well as diversified our markets to mitigate the effects of economic downturns; however, such programs may be unsuccessful. Any sustained weakness in demand or downturn or uncertainty in the economy generally would materially reduce our net sales and profitability.\nFor example, sales to the construction industry are driven by trends in commercial and residential construction, housing starts and trends in residential repair and remodeling. Consumer confidence, weather conditions, mortgage rates, credit standards and availability of consumer credit and income levels play a significant role in driving demand in commercial and residential construction, repair and remodeling sector. A drop or weakness in consumer confidence, prolonged adverse weather conditions, lack of availability or increased cost of credit, credit standards or unemployment could delay a recovery of commercial and residential construction levels and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. This may express itself in the form of substantial downward pressure on product pricing and our profit margins, thereby adversely affecting our financial results.\nAdditionally, many of our products are used in the energy, mining and cement and aggregates markets. Certain customers may defer or cancel anticipated projects or expansions until such time as these projects will be profitable based on the underlying cost of commodities compared to the cost of the project.\nVolatility and disruption of financial markets, as in recent years, could limit the ability of our customers to obtain adequate financing to maintain operations and may cause them to terminate existing purchase orders, reduce the volume of products they purchase from us in the future or impact their ability to pay their receivables. Adverse economic and financial market conditions may also cause our suppliers to be unable to meet their commitments to us or may cause suppliers to make changes in the credit terms they extend to us, such as shortening the required payment period for outstanding accounts receivable or reducing or eliminating the amount of trade credit available to us.\nOur international operations are subject to uncertainties, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur business is subject to certain risks associated with doing business internationally. A significant portion of our sales are international; approximately 33% of our total net sales in fiscal 2015 originated outside of the U.S. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors relating to international operations, including:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly fluctuations in the Euro against the U.S. dollar;\n\u2022\nforeign exchange controls;\n\u2022\ncompliance with export controls and trade compliance regulations;\n\u2022\ntariffs or other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws;\n\u2022\ninterest rates;\n\u2022\ndifferences in business practices in various countries;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory requirements in countries in which we operate or make sales;\n\u2022\ndiffering labor regulations; practices and standards;\n\u2022\nrequirements relating to withholding taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on our ability to own or operate subsidiaries, make investments or acquire new businesses in these jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nrestrictions under U.S. tax laws and other laws on our ability to repatriate dividends from our foreign subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nexposure to liabilities under anti-corruption laws in various countries, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (\"FCPA\").\nAs we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. However, any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our international operations and, consequently, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe loss or financial instability of any significant customer could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe have certain customers that are significant to our business. During fiscal 2015, our top 20 customers accounted for approximately 34.9% of our consolidated net sales, and our largest customer accounted for 8.9% of our consolidated net sales. Our competitors may adopt more aggressive sales policies and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do, which could result in a loss of customers. The loss of one or more of our major customers or deterioration in our relationship with any of them could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur contracted backlog is comprised of future orders for our products from a broad number of customers. Defaults by any of the customers that have placed significant orders with us could have a significant adverse effect on our net sales, profitability and cash flow. Our customers may in the future default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons deriving from the general economic environment or circumstances affecting those customers in particular. If a customer defaults on its obligations to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. As of March 31, 2015, approximately 13% of our backlog was scheduled to ship beyond fiscal 2016.\nWe rely on independent distributors. Termination of one or more of our relationships with any of those independent distributors or an increase in the distributors\u2019 sales of our competitors\u2019 products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn addition to our own direct sales force, we depend on the services of independent distributors to sell our Process & Motion Control products and provide service and aftermarket support to our OEMs and end users. We rely on an extensive distribution network, with nearly 2,500 distributor locations nationwide; however, for fiscal 2015, approximately 25% of our Process & Motion\nControl net sales were generated through sales to three of our key independent distributors, the largest of which accounted for 15% of Process & Motion Control net sales. Rather than serving as passive conduits for delivery of product, our industrial distributors are active participants in the overall competitive dynamic in the Process & Motion Control industry. Industrial distributors play a significant role in determining which of our Process & Motion Control products are stocked at the branch locations, and hence are most readily accessible to aftermarket buyers, and the price at which these products are sold. Almost all of the distributors with whom we transact business also offer competitors\u2019 products and services to our customers. Within Water Management, we depend on a network of several hundred independent sales representatives and approximately 90 third-party warehouses to distribute our products; however, for fiscal 2015, our three key independent distributors generated approximately 28% of our Water Management net sales with the largest accounting for 16% of Water Management net sales.\nOur Process & Motion Control and Water Management distributorship sales are made on terms that we believe are consistent with customary standards in our industry. Our agreements with our distributors are generally non-exclusive and do not require minimum volumes of purchases by the distributors, with prices based on expected margins and all sales subject to credit approval; they generally contain a limited warranty against material and workmanship defects and provide for a freight allowance when minimum quantities are met.\nThe loss of one of our key distributors or of a substantial number of our other distributors or an increase in the distributors' sales of our competitors' products to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIncreases in the cost or availability of raw materials could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur manufacturing processes depend on third parties for raw materials, in particular bar steel, brass, castings, copper, forgings, high-performance engineered plastic, plate steel, resin, sheet steel and zinc, as well as petroleum products. We generally purchase our raw materials on the open market on a purchase order basis. These contracts generally have had one to five year terms and have contained competitive and benchmarking clauses intended to ensure competitive pricing. While we currently maintain alternative sources for raw materials, our business is subject to the risk of price fluctuations, delays in the delivery of and potential unavailability of our raw materials. Any such price fluctuations or delays, if material, could harm our profitability or operations. In addition, the loss of a substantial number of suppliers could result in material cost increases or reduce our production capacity.\nIn addition, prices for petroleum products and other carbon-based fuel products have experienced significant volatility in recent years. Price increases, and consequent increases in the cost of electricity and for products for which petroleum-based products are components or used in part of the process of manufacture, may substantially increase our costs for transportation, fuel, component parts and manufacturing. We may not be able to recoup the costs of these increases by adjusting our prices.\nWe do not typically enter into hedge transactions to reduce our exposure to price risks and cannot assure you that we would be successful in passing on any attendant costs if these risks were to materialize. In addition, if we are unable to continue to purchase our required quantities of raw materials on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or if we are unable to maintain or enter into our purchasing contracts for our larger commodities, our business operations could be disrupted and our profitability could be impacted in a material adverse manner.\nWeather could adversely affect the demand for products in our Water Management platform and decrease its net sales\nDemand for our Water Management products is primarily driven by commercial construction activity, remodeling and retrofit opportunities, and to a lesser extent, new home starts as well as water and wastewater infrastructure expansion for municipal, industrial and hydropower applications. Weather is an important variable affecting financial performance as it significantly impacts construction activity. Spring and summer months in the U.S. and Europe represent the main construction seasons. Adverse weather conditions, such as prolonged periods of cold or rain, blizzards, hurricanes and other severe weather patterns, could delay or halt construction and remodeling activity, which could have a negative effect on our business. For example, an unusually severe winter can lead to reduced construction activity and magnify the seasonal decline in our Water Management net sales and earnings during the winter months. In addition, a prolonged winter season can delay construction and remodeling plans and hamper the typical seasonal increase in net sales and earnings during the spring months.\nWe are subject to risks associated with changing technology, manufacturing techniques, distribution channels and business continuity, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe successful implementation of our business strategy requires us to continuously evolve our existing products and introduce new products to meet customers' needs in the industries we serve. Our products are characterized by stringent performance and specification requirements that mandate a high degree of manufacturing and engineering expertise. If we fail to meet these requirements, our business could be at risk. We believe that our customers rigorously evaluate their suppliers on the basis of a number of factors, including product quality, price competitiveness, technical and manufacturing expertise, development and product design capability, new product innovation, reliability and timeliness of delivery, operational flexibility, customer service\nand overall management. Our success will depend on our ability to continue to meet our customers' changing specifications with respect to these criteria. We cannot assure you that we will be able to address technological advances or introduce new products that may be necessary to remain competitive within our businesses. We cannot assure you that we can adequately protect any of our own technological developments to produce a sustainable competitive advantage. Furthermore, we may be subject to business continuity risk in the event of an unexpected loss of a material facility or operation. We cannot assure you that we can adequately protect against such a loss.\nThe updates to our Enterprise Resource Planning (\u201cERP\u201d) systems, as well as failures of our data security and information technology infrastructure and security, could cause substantial business interruptions and/or adversely affect our business.\nUtilizing a phased approach, we continue to update our ERP systems across both our Process & Motion Control and Water Management platforms. If these updates are unsuccessful, we could incur substantial business interruptions, including the inability to perform routine business transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Further, these updates may not result in the benefits we intend or be implemented on a timely basis.\nIn addition, we depend heavily on information technology infrastructure to manage our business objectives and operations, support our customers\u2019 requirements and protect sensitive information. There have been significant and increasing instances of data and security breaches, malicious interference with technology systems and industrial espionage involving companies in numerous industries. As a result, any inability by us to successfully manage our information systems, or respond effectively to any attack on or interference with our systems, including matters related to system and data security, privacy, reliability, compliance, performance and access, problems related to our systems caused by natural disasters, security breaches or malicious attacks, and any inability of these systems to fulfill their intended business purpose, could impede our ability to record or process orders, manufacture and ship in a timely manner, account for and collect receivables, protect sensitive data of the Company, our customers, our suppliers and business partners, comply with our third party obligations of confidentiality and care, or otherwise carry on business in the normal course. Any such events could require significant costly remediation and could cause us to lose customers and/or revenue, require us to incur significant expense to remediate, including as a result of legal or regulatory claims or proceedings, or damage our reputation, any of which could have an adverse effect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may incur significant costs for environmental compliance and/or to address liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.\nOur operations and facilities worldwide are subject to extensive laws and regulations related to pollution and the protection of the environment, health and safety, including those governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharges to water, the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes and other materials, and the remediation of contaminated sites. A failure by us to comply with applicable requirements or the permits required for our operations could result in civil or criminal fines, penalties, enforcement actions, third-party claims for property damage and personal injury, requirements to clean up property or to pay for the costs of cleanup or regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures, including the installation of pollution control equipment or remedial actions.\nSome environmental laws and regulations impose requirements to investigate and remediate contamination on present and former owners and operators of facilities and sites, and on potentially responsible parties (\u201cPRPs\u201d) for sites to which such parties may have sent waste for disposal. Such liability can be imposed without regard to fault and, under certain circumstances, may be joint and several, resulting in one PRP being held responsible for the entire obligation. Liability may also include damages to natural resources. On occasion we are involved in such investigations and/or cleanup, and also have been or could be named as a PRP in environmental matters.\nThe discovery of additional contamination, including at acquired facilities, the imposition of more stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including cleanup requirements, disputes with our insurers or the insolvency of other responsible parties could require us to incur significant capital expenditures or operating costs in excess of our accruals. Future investigations we undertake may lead to discoveries of contamination that must be remediated, and decisions to close facilities may trigger remediation requirements that are not currently applicable. We may also face liability for alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to hazardous substances used or disposed of by us, contained within our current or former products, or present in the soil or groundwater at our current or former facilities. We could incur significant costs in connection with such liabilities. See Part II Item 8, Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements.\nCertain subsidiaries are subject to litigation, including numerous asbestos and product liability claims, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nCertain subsidiaries are co-defendants in various lawsuits filed in a number of jurisdictions throughout the U.S. alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products. The uncertainties of litigation and the uncertainties related to the collection of insurance and indemnification coverage make it difficult to accurately predict the ultimate financial effect of these claims. In the event our insurance or indemnification coverage becomes insufficient to cover our potential financial exposure, or the actual number or value of asbestos-related claims differs materially from our existing estimates, we could incur material costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn addition, we may be subject to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products, or the exposure to our products or their raw materials, is alleged to have resulted in injury or other adverse effects. We currently maintain product liability insurance coverage but we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such insurance on commercially reasonable terms in the future, if at all, or that any such insurance will provide adequate coverage against claims. Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. An unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed. In the event that this reputation is damaged as a result of a product liability claim, we may face difficulty in maintaining our pricing positions and market share with respect to some of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nSee Part II Item 8, Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.\nInability to identify, or effectively integrate, acquisitions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe cannot assure you that suitable acquisition candidates will be identified and acquired in the future, that the financing of any such acquisition will be available on satisfactory terms, that we will be able to complete any such acquisition or that we will be able to accomplish our strategic objectives as a result of any such acquisition. Nor can we assure you that our acquisition strategies will be successfully received by customers or achieve their intended benefits.\nAcquisitions are often undertaken to improve the operating results of either or both of the acquirer and the acquired company and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in this regard nor can we provide any assurance that we will be able to realize all of the intended benefits from our prior acquisitions. We have encountered, and may encounter, various risks in acquiring other companies including the possible inability to integrate an acquired business into our operations, potential failure to realize anticipated benefits, diversion of management's attention, issues in customer transitions, potential inadequacies of indemnities and other contractual remedies and unanticipated problems, risks or liabilities, including environmental, some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may be unable to realize intended benefits from our cost reduction, restructuring and divestiture efforts, and as a result our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected.\nIn order to operate more efficiently and control costs, we undertake from time to time restructuring plans, which include global facility consolidations, product rationalizations, workforce reductions and other cost reduction initiatives. We also choose to divest operations which we no longer believe are additive or complementary to our platforms or strategic direction. These plans are intended to reduce operating costs, to modify our footprint to reflect changes in the markets we serve, to reflect changes in business focus and/or to address the impact of acquisitions on our overall manufacturing capacity. We may undertake further restructuring actions, workforce reductions or divestitures in the future. These types of activities are complex. If we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities, or any other restructuring activities or divestitures that we may undertake in the future, expected efficiencies, benefits and cost savings might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. In addition, as a result of such actions, we expect to incur restructuring expenses and other charges, which may be material, as well as other effects on our financial status. Several factors could cause restructuring or divestiture activities to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These include potential disruption of our operations and other aspects of our business. Employee morale and productivity could also suffer or result in unintended employee attrition. These activities require substantial management time and attention and may divert management from other important work or result in a failure to meet operational targets. Divestures may also give rise to obligations to buyers or other parties that could have a financial effect after the transaction is completed. Moreover, we could encounter changes to, or delays in executing, any restructuring or divestiture plans, either of which could cause further disruption and additional unanticipated expense.\nOur credit agreement imposes significant operating and financial restrictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur credit agreement contains various covenants that limit or prohibit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends on our capital stock or redeem, repurchase, retire or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or subordinated indebtedness or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake certain loans, acquisitions, capital expenditures or investments;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets, including stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur liens;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates.\nOur credit agreement contains covenants that restrict our ability to take certain actions, such as incurring additional debt, if we are unable to meet defined specified financial ratios. As of March 31, 2015, our first lien leverage ratio was 3.85x. Failure to comply with the leverage covenant of the credit agreement can result in limiting our long-term growth prospects by hindering our ability to incur future indebtedness or grow through acquisitions. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements. For more information, see Part II Item 7 \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\".\nThe restrictions contained in the credit agreement could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans;\n\u2022\nrestrict our announced plans to repurchase shares of our common stock;\n\u2022\nadversely affect our ability to finance our operations, to enter into strategic acquisitions, to fund investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest; and\n\u2022\nlimit our access to the cash generated by our subsidiaries.\nUpon the occurrence of an event of default under the credit agreement, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the senior secured credit facilities on a first-priority lien basis. If the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, such acceleration could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. For a more detailed description of the limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, see Part II Item 7 \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\".\nThe inability to adequately protect intellectual property, or defend against infringement claims brought against us, could adversely affect our business.\nWe attempt to protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection, as well as third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements. We cannot assure you that any of our applications for protection of our intellectual property rights will be approved and maintained or that our competitors will not infringe or successfully challenge our intellectual property rights. We also rely on unpatented proprietary technology. It is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology. To protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, we require employees, consultants and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements. We cannot assure you that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure. If we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies, our ability to sustain margins on some or all of our products may be affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, in the ordinary course of our operations, from time to time we pursue and are pursued in potential litigation relating to the protection of certain intellectual property rights, including some of our more profitable products. An adverse ruling in any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur failure to comply with third-party certification requirements and customer-driven policies and standards, including those related to social responsibility, could adversely affect our reputation, business and results of operations.\nIn addition to complying with applicable government regulations and requirements, prevailing industry standards, competitive pressures and/or our customers may require us to comply with further quality, social responsibility, or other business policies or standards, before customers and prospective customers commence, or continue, doing business with us. These expectations, policies and standards may be more restrictive than current laws and regulations as well as our own pre-existing\npolicies; they may be customer-driven, established by the industry sectors in which we operate or imposed by third-party organizations.\nOur compliance with these policies, standards and third party certification requirements could be costly and could in some cases require us to change the way in which we operate. In addition, if we fail to comply, we could experience an adverse effect on our customer relationships, reputation, operations and profitability.\nDisruptions caused by labor disputes or organized labor activities could adversely affect our business or financial results.\nAs of March 31, 2015, we had approximately 8,000 employees, of whom approximately 4,500 were employed in the U.S. Approximately 500 of our U.S. employees are represented by labor unions. Additionally, approximately 1,900 of our employees reside in Europe, where trade union membership is common. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are currently strong, if our unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown in the future, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, which could interfere with our ability to deliver products on a timely basis and could have other negative effects, such as decreased productivity and increased labor costs. Such negative effects could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, if a greater percentage of our workforce becomes unionized, our business and financial results could be affected in a material adverse manner. Further, many of our direct and indirect customers and their suppliers, and organizations responsible for shipping our products, have unionized workforces and their businesses may be impacted by strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns, any of which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur inability to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends on our ability to recruit, retain and develop highly-skilled management and key personnel. Competition for these persons in our industry is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit, train or retain qualified personnel, or to effectively implement successions to existing personnel. If we fail to retain and recruit the necessary personnel or arrange for successors to key personnel, our business could materially suffer.\nOur required cash contributions to our pension plans may increase further and we could experience a material change in the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and the amount recorded in our consolidated balance sheets related to those plans. Additionally, our pension costs could increase in future years.\nThe funded status of the defined benefit pension plans depends on such factors as asset returns, market interest rates, legislative changes and funding regulations. If the returns on the assets of any of our plans were to decline in future periods, if market interest rates were to decline, if the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (\u201cPBGC\u201d) were to require additional contributions to any such plans as a result of acquisitions or if other actuarial assumptions were to be modified, our future required cash contributions and pension costs to such plans could increase. Any such increases could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe need to make contributions, which may be substantial, to such plans may reduce the cash available to meet our other obligations, including our obligations under our credit agreement or to meet the needs of our business. In addition, the PBGC may terminate our U.S. defined benefit pension plans under limited circumstances, including in the event the PBGC concludes that the risk may increase unreasonably if such plans continue. In the event a U.S. defined benefit pension plan is terminated for any reason while it is underfunded, we could be required to make an immediate payment to the PBGC of all or a substantial portion of such plan's underfunding, as calculated by the PBGC based on its own assumptions (which might result in a larger obligation than that based on the assumptions we have used to fund such plan), and the PBGC could place a lien on material amounts of our assets.\nOur goodwill and intangible assets are valued at an amount that is high relative to our total assets.\nAs of March 31, 2015, goodwill and intangible assets totaled $1,202.3 million and $587.7 million, respectively. These assets result from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the tangible net assets we have acquired. We assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes to the use of our assets, changes in the structure of our business, divestitures, market capitalization declines, or increases in associated discount rates may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets. Any determination requiring the impairment of goodwill or intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations, particularly in the period in which we take any related charges and financial condition.\nOur organizational documents may impede or discourage a takeover, which could deprive our stockholders of the opportunity to receive a premium for their shares.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for, or prevent a third party from, acquiring control of us without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nhaving a classified board of directors;\n\u2022\nestablishing limitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nempowering only the board to fill any vacancy on our board of directors, whether such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise;\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholders from acting by written consent or calling a special meeting; and\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nOur issuance of shares of preferred stock could delay or prevent a change in control of us. Our board of directors has the authority to cause us to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders, shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to designate the number of shares constituting any series, and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series. The issuance of shares of our preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control without further action by the stockholders, even where stockholders are offered a premium for their shares.", "PERMNO": 13305, "SIC": 3560, "TIC": "RXN"}
