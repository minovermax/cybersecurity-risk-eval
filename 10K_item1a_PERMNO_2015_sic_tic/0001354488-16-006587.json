Certain statements and information set forth in this 2015 Form 10-K, as well as other written or oral statements made from time to time by us or by our authorized officers on our behalf, constitute \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We intend for our forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You should note that forward-looking statements in this document speak only as of the date of this 2015 Form 10-K and we undertake no duty or obligation to update or revise our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Although we believe that the expectations, plans, intentions and projections reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. The risks, uncertainties and other factors that our stockholders and prospective investors should consider include the following:\nOur stockholders will not be able to buy or sell shares of our common stock after we close our stock transfer books on the Final Record Date (as defined below).\nAt the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on October 15, 2015, the Company's stockholders approved a proposal to dissolve the Company (the \"Dissolution\"), which provided the Board of Directors discretion to determine, within twelve months of such approval, when and whether to proceed with the approved Plan of Dissolution. If the Board of Directors determines to proceed with the Dissolution, we intend to close our stock transfer books and discontinue recording transfers of our common stock on the date on which we file our Certificate of Dissolution with the Delaware Secretary of State (the \u201cFinal Record Date\u201d). After we close our stock transfer books, we will not record any further transfers of our common stock on our books except by will, intestate succession or operation of law. Therefore, shares of our common stock will not be freely transferable after the Final Record Date. All liquidating distributions from a liquidating trust, if any, or from us after the Final Record Date will be made to our stockholders pro rata according to their respective holdings of common stock as of the Final Record Date.\nFollowing the Sale Transaction, we have no operating assets and we will need to significantly reduce our corporate and administrative expenses.\nFollowing the Sale Transaction, the Company has no operating assets remaining and no revenue producing business or operations. We intend to retain only those persons required to maintain our corporate existence. As such, it is important that we take immediate steps to resolve remaining liabilities and reduce future costs and expenses in order to preserve cash. The failure of the Company to take such steps promptly could result in a reduction in the amount of cash remaining for distribution to stockholders in connection with the proposed Dissolution.\nWe will continue to incur the expenses of complying with public company reporting requirements.\nAfter the Sale Transaction, we will still have an obligation to comply with the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including reporting requirements under the Exchange Act. Following the Sale Transaction, our Board of Directors will consider options to reduce or eliminate such costs such as, de-registering as an Exchange Act reporting company by way of a reverse stock split or otherwise in an effort to reduce expenses and retain cash that may be available for future distributions to our stockholders, if any distributions are made. We can provide no assurance that any such actions will be taken or, if taken, will have the intended effect.\nWe cannot predict the timing of any distributions to stockholders.\nOur current intention is that the Dissolution would begin within one year following stockholder approval of the Dissolution, which approval was obtained on October 15, 2015; however, the decision of whether or not to proceed with the Dissolution and when to proceed will be made by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion. No further stockholder approval would be required to effect the Dissolution, provided that under the Plan of Dissolution the Certificate of Dissolution must be filed by the one-year anniversary of stockholder approval of the Dissolution. However, if the Board of Directors determines that the Dissolution is not in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders, the Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, abandon the Plan of Dissolution or may amend or modify the Plan of Dissolution to the extent permitted by Delaware law without the necessity of further stockholder approval.\nUnder Delaware law, before a dissolved corporation may make any distributions to its stockholders, it must pay or make reasonable provision to pay all of its claims and obligations, including all contingent, conditional or un-matured claims known to the corporation. We cannot predict the settlement amounts, fines or penalties, if any, that we might incur as a result of our ongoing litigation and regulatory matters, and therefore we are unable to make a reasonable provision to pay any such claims. Furthermore, we may be subject to potential liabilities relating to indemnification obligations to Ecolab or to current and former officers and directors. It might take several years to resolve these matters, and as a result we are unable to predict the timing for distributions, if any are made, to our stockholders.\nWe cannot estimate the amount of distributions, if any, to be made to our stockholders.\nWe believe the value of our assets that will ultimately be available for distribution to our stockholders, if any distribution is made, will be significantly and materially less, in the aggregate, than the consideration received in the Sale Transaction. We cannot estimate amounts to be distributed to our stockholders if the Board of Directors proceeds with the Dissolution.\nProceeds from the Sale Transaction will be used to pay off the Company\u2019s outstanding debts and liabilities including the retained liabilities, outstanding service provider and vendor bills, and professional fees relating to the costs of being a public company.\nThe balance of the proceeds will be retained to pay ongoing corporate and administrative costs of a public company and expenses associated with winding down the Company, liabilities and potential liabilities relating to or arising out of our outstanding litigation and regulatory matters, fines or penalties, and potential liabilities relating to our indemnification obligations, if any, to Ecolab or to current and former officers and directors.\nThe Board of Directors will determine, in its sole discretion, the timing of the distribution of the remaining amounts, if any, to our stockholders in the Dissolution. We can provide no assurance as to if or when any such distribution will be made, and we cannot provide an estimate as to the amount to be paid to stockholders in any such distribution, if one is made. However, we expect the amount of any such distribution, if one is made, to be significantly and materially less, in the aggregate, than the consideration received in the Sale Transaction.\nThe Internal Revenue Service may not treat distributions to our stockholders, if any distributions are made, as distributions in complete liquidation as such term is described in Section 346(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, or may not treat a liquidating trust, if one is used, as a \"liquidating trust\" for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThe term \u201ccomplete liquidation\u201d is not defined in the Internal Revenue Code. The approval of the Sale Transaction and the Dissolution by the Company's stockholders does not ensure that any liquidating distributions we make will be treated as distributions in \u201ccomplete liquidation\u201d by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company intends to accomplish the Dissolution of the Company in a manner that will qualify as a \u201ccomplete liquidation\u201d within the meaning of Section 346(a) of the Code, but there can be no assurance that its efforts to do so will be successful. If distributions do not so qualify, they will be treated as dividends to our shareholders to the extent of our earnings and profits.\nThe Company will also endeavor to ensure that any liquidating trust, if formed to be the transferee of certain of the assets of the Company, will be treated for tax purposes as a liquidating trust for Federal income tax purposes. However, there can be no assurance that any liquidating trust, if created, will be treated as a liquidating trust for federal income tax purposes. If the liquidating trust is not treated as a trust but instead is treated as a continuation of the existing corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the liquidating distributions would likely not be treated as distributions in complete liquidation for tax purposes and would likely be treated as taxable dividends to the extent of the Company\u2019s earnings and profits.\nOur stockholders may be liable to our creditors for part or all of the amount received from us in our liquidating distributions if reserves are inadequate.\nIf the Dissolution becomes effective, we may establish a contingency reserve designed to satisfy any additional claims and obligations that may arise. Any contingency reserve may not be adequate to cover all of our claims and obligations. Under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, if we fail to create an adequate contingency reserve for payment of our claims and obligations during the three-year period after we file the Certificate of Dissolution with the Delaware Secretary of State, each stockholder could be held liable for payment to our creditors of the lesser of (i) such stockholder's pro rata share of amounts owed to creditors in excess of the contingency reserve and (ii) the amounts previously received by such stockholder in dissolution from us and from any liquidating trust or trusts. Accordingly, in such event, a stockholder could be required to return part or all of the distributions previously made to such stockholder, and a stockholder could receive nothing from us under the Plan of Dissolution. Moreover, if a stockholder has paid taxes on amounts previously received, a repayment of all or a portion of such amount could result in a situation in which a stockholder may incur a net tax cost if the repayment of the amount previously distributed does not cause a commensurate reduction in taxes payable in an amount equal to the amount of the taxes paid on amounts previously distributed.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and we may be unable to develop, implement and maintain appropriate controls in future periods. If the material weaknesses are not remediated, then they could result in material misstatements to the financial statements.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and, as a result of such weaknesses, our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Material weaknesses were originally identified in connection with our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, and were determined not to have been remediated as of December 31, 2014 and 2015. Until remediated, these material weaknesses could result in material misstatements to our interim or annual consolidated financial statements and disclosures that may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In addition, we may be unable to meet our reporting obligations or comply with SEC rules and regulations, which could result in investigation and sanctions by regulatory authorities. Any of these results could adversely affect our financial condition and the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are and may in the future be subject to legal proceedings; the outcomes of which are uncertain, and resolutions adverse to us could negatively affect our financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are and may in the future be subject to legal proceedings. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcome of individual matters with assurance. It is reasonably possible that the final resolution of these matters could require additional expenditures, in excess of established reserves, over an extended period of time and in a range of amounts that could have a material effect on our financial condition and cash flows.\nInsurance policies may not cover all ongoing risks and a casualty loss beyond the limits of our coverage could adversely impact our business.\nWe maintain insurance policies in such amounts and with such coverage and deductibles that we believe are reasonable and prudent. Nevertheless, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities and expenses that may arise and our current levels of insurance may not be able to be maintained or available at economical prices. If a significant liability claim is brought against us that is not covered by insurance, we may have to pay the claim with our own funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows.\nOur stock price has been and may in the future be volatile which could cause purchasers of our common stock to incur substantial losses.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and may in the future be subject to substantial price volatility. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the factors listed below and other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section:\n\u00b7\nlow trading volume, which could cause even a small number of purchases or sales of our stock to have an impact on the trading price of our common stock;\n\u00b7\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u00b7\nsignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of comparable companies;\n\u00b7\nshort sales, hedging and other derivative transactions involving our common stock; and\n\u00b7\nsales of shares in the open market or the perception that such sales could occur.\nCertain stockholders may exert significant influence over any corporate action requiring stockholder approval.\nAs of March 4, 2016, Messrs. Huizenga and Berrard own approximately 13.7% and 14.1% of our common stock, respectively. As a result, these stockholders may be in a position to exert significant influence over any corporate action requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, determination of significant corporate actions, amendments to Swisher Hygiene Inc.\u2019s certificate of incorporation and by-laws, and the approval of any business transaction, such as mergers or takeover attempts, in a manner that could conflict with the interests of other stockholders.\nProvisions of Delaware law and our organizational documents may delay or prevent an acquisition of our Company, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions of Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions may also prevent or delay attempts by stockholders to replace or remove management or members of our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u00b7\nthe absence of cumulative voting in the election of directors, which means that the holders of a majority of our common stock may elect all of the directors standing for election;\n\u00b7\nthe inability of our stockholders to call special meetings;\n\u00b7\nthe requirement that our stockholders provide advance notice when nominating director candidates or proposing business to be considered by the stockholders at an annual meeting of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of the our board of directors to make, alter or repeal our bylaws;\n\u00b7\nthe requirement that the authorized number of directors be changed only by resolution of the board of directors; and\n\u00b7\nthe inability of stockholders to act by written consent.", "PERMNO": 12585, "SIC": 5160, "TIC": "SWSH"}
