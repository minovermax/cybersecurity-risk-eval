Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations, and you should carefully consider them. Accordingly, in evaluating our business, we encourage you to consider the following discussion of risk factors, in its entirety, in addition to other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other public filings with the SEC. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Condition and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe are a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused primarily on developing our lead product candidate, N91115, for CF. We have incurred significant net losses in each year since our inception, including net losses of $22.8 million, $15.0 million and $16.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $148.8 million.\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our equity securities and convertible debt. We have devoted most of our financial resources to research and development, including our preclinical research and development activities and clinical trials. We have not completed the development of any product candidate. We expect to continue to incur significant and increasing losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future. The size of our losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future expenditures and our ability to generate revenue. We expect to incur substantial and increased expenses arising from the clinical development of N91115 or any other potential product candidate, including, in particular, as we:\n\u00b7\nprepare for and execute on the Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical programs for N91115;\n\u00b7\nscale up development, including contracted manufacturing processes and quantities to prepare for larger clinical trials and the commercialization of N91115;\n\u00b7\nseek to obtain regulatory approvals for N91115;\n\u00b7\nprepare for the commercialization of N91115, including establishing an infrastructure for the sales, marketing and distribution of N91115 for any indications for which we receive regulatory approval;\n\u00b7\nexpand our research and development activities to identify and potentially advance other product candidates;\n\u00b7\nmaintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and\n\u00b7\nadd operational, financial and management information systems and personnel to support our clinical development, commercialization efforts and operations as a public company.\nOur recurring losses from operations have raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have had recurring losses from operations and previous reports on our financial statements by our independent registered public accounting firm have included an explanatory paragraph with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern. We will likely not generate meaningful revenue until and unless N91115 or another potential product candidate is approved by the FDA or comparable regulatory agencies in other countries and successfully marketed, either by us or a partner, an outcome which may not occur. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and interest thereon will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements to mid-2017. However, if we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets, and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation and dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements. The perception that we may not be able to continue as a going concern may have an adverse impact on our business due to concerns about our ability to meet our contractual obligations. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, an investor could lose all or part of their investment in our company.\nOur ability to generate future revenue and achieve and maintain profitability is uncertain and depends upon our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize N91115 or any other potential product candidate.\nOur ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends on our ability, alone or with collaborators, to successfully complete the development of, obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for, and commercialize, a product candidate. We have never obtained approval for or commercialized a product candidate. Our N91115 development program is currently focused on demonstrating the clinical benefit of N91115 for CF patients when added to other CFTR modulators. Initially, this program includes N91115 administered as part of triple therapy with Vertex\u2019s co-formulated CFTR modulators, lumacaftor with ivacaftor, or lumacaftor/ivacaftor. The evaluation of N91115 in other mutations is also planned. We do not anticipate generating revenue from sales of N91115 or any other potential product candidate for the foreseeable future, if ever. Our ability to generate future revenue depends heavily on:\n\u00b7\nobtaining regulatory approval in the United States for N91115 in CF and equivalent foreign regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7\nthe commercial launch of lumacaftor/ivacaftor in the U.S. and in other geographic regions;\n\u00b7\nthe continued commercial viability of lumacaftor/ivacaftor as a leading therapy in CF;\n\u00b7\nwhether N91115 may be combined with other future commercially successful therapies, if any, that could influence the standard of care in CF, and the age groups and geographic regions in which these other therapies are available;\n\u00b7\nlaunching and commercializing N91115, including establishing an infrastructure for the sales, marketing and distribution of N91115;\n\u00b7\nachieving broad market acceptance of N91115 in the medical community and with third party payers;\n\u00b7\nobtaining favorable results for and continuing to develop N91115, including successfully initiating and completing our planned Phase 2 clinical program, as well as future trials thereafter; and\n\u00b7\ngenerating a pipeline of product candidates other than N91115.\nConducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data required to obtain regulatory approval and generate revenue. Our anticipated development costs would likely increase if we do not obtain favorable clinical results or if development of N91115 or any other potential product candidate is delayed. In particular, if the commercialization of Vertex\u2019s lumacaftor/ivacaftor is unsuccessful and/or we are required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or comparable regulatory authorities in other countries, to perform studies or trials in addition to those that we currently anticipate, we would likely incur higher costs than we currently anticipate. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of any increase in our anticipated development costs.\nIn addition, N91115 or any other potential product candidate, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenue, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available until at least 2018, if at all. Even if a product candidate is approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs in connection with commercialization. As a result, we cannot assure that we will be able to generate revenue, or that we will achieve or maintain profitability even if we do generate revenue.\nEven if N91115 or any other potential product candidate receives regulatory approvals or is commercialized, if it later shows unanticipated properties, or if revenue is insufficient, we will not achieve or maintain profitability and our business may fail. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could cause an investor to lose all or part of his, her or its investment.\nWe will need to raise additional funding to launch and commercialize N91115 or any other potential product candidate, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If we fail to obtain additional financing, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate development efforts for N91115 and any other potential product candidate, seek corporate partners or relinquish or license on unfavorable terms our rights to technologies or product candidates.\nDeveloping pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete. We expect our research and development expenses to substantially increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance our clinical program for N91115.\nBased upon our current operating plan, we expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements to mid-2017 when we expect to be enrolling patients in our Phase 3 clinical program for N91115. We will require additional funding prior to the completion of development, approval and commercialization of N91115. However, changing circumstances beyond our control may cause us to consume capital more rapidly than we currently anticipate. For example, our clinical trials may encounter technical, enrollment or other difficulties that could increase our development costs more than we expected, or the FDA may require us to perform studies or trials in addition to those that we currently anticipate. We will need to raise additional funds if we choose to initiate clinical trials for a potential product candidate other than N91115 or to administer N91115 with drugs other than lumacaftor/ivacaftor. We will also need to raise additional funds if we need to obtain regulatory approval to expand the label for N91115 in distinct CF populations. In any event, we will require additional capital to obtain regulatory approval for, and the commercialization of, our product candidates.\nSecuring additional financing may divert our management from our day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize N91115 or any other potential product candidate. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may be required to:\n\u00b7\nsignificantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of N91115 or any other potential product candidate;\n\u00b7\nseek corporate partners at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available; or\n\u00b7\nrelinquish or license on unfavorable terms, our rights to technologies or to N91115 or any other potential product candidate that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves, or sell all of our assets or our entire business.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we will be prevented from pursuing development and commercialization efforts, which will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects, and may cause us to cease operations.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or to a product candidate.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs primarily through public or private equity or convertible debt offerings, partnerships, grants or other nondilutive sources of financing. We currently do not have any committed external source of funds.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt, the ownership interests of our stockholders will be diluted. In addition, the terms of any equity or convertible debt we agree to issue may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Convertible debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, and declaring dividends, and may impose limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.\nIf we are unable to raise additional funds, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our research and development or commercialization efforts, or grant others rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nWe have a limited operating history, which may make it difficult for investors to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nWe are a clinical stage pharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. Our operations to date have been primarily limited to organizing and staffing our company, acquiring and developing product and technology rights and conducting research and development activities. We have recently initiated Phase 2 clinical development for N91115. We have not obtained regulatory approval for N91115 or any other potential product candidate. Consequently, any predictions about our future success, performance or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history, achieved a later stage of clinical development or approved products on the market.\nOur inability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards before they expire may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2015 we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $54.7 million, which may be utilized against future federal and state income taxes. In general, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders, generally stockholders beneficially owning five percent or more of our common stock, applying certain look-through and aggregation rules, increases by more than 50% over such stockholders\u2019 lowest percentage ownership during the testing period, generally three years. Purchases of our common stock in amounts greater than specified levels, which will be beyond our control, could create a limitation on our ability to utilize our NOLs for tax purposes in the future. Limitations imposed on our ability to utilize NOLs could cause us to pay U.S. federal and state income taxes earlier than we would otherwise be required if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such NOLs to expire unused. Furthermore, we may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our NOLs before they expire beginning in 2032. In addition, at the state level there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which would accelerate or may permanently increase state taxes owed. If any of these events occur, we may not derive some or all of the expected benefits from our NOLs, and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected as a result. As of December 31, 2015, we have not performed a formal study to determine whether limitations to our NOLs have occurred or whether such limitations could result from the sale of shares in our initial public offering in June 2015. Such limitations could be significant.\nRisks Relating to Clinical Development and Regulatory Approval\nWe depend almost entirely on the success of our lead product candidate, N91115, which has recently begun Phase 2 clinical testing, and which will need regulatory approval before it can be commercialized. We may not be able to obtain or may be delayed in obtaining regulatory approval for N91115.\nWe depend almost entirely on the success of our lead product candidate, N91115, which recently began Phase 2 clinical testing. Regulatory agencies, including the FDA, ultimately must approve any product candidate before it can be promoted, marketed or commercially distributed. N91115 and any other potential product candidate we develop will be subject to extensive and rigorous review and regulation by governmental authorities. We have never obtained approval for or commercialized a product candidate. The timing of this process can be unpredictable and may include post-marketing studies and surveillance, which would require the expenditure of additional resources beyond our existing cash, cash equivalents or marketable securities. Of the large number of drugs in development for approval in the United States, only a small percentage successfully complete the regulatory approval process and are commercialized. The success of N91115 depends on, among other things:\n\u00b7\nour ability to complete clinical trials and other product research and development activities;\n\u00b7\nwhether our clinical trials for N91115 demonstrate statistically significant and clinically meaningful efficacy not outweighed by safety issues;\n\u00b7\nmeeting FDA and other regulatory agencies\u2019 requirements to obtain approval for a product candidate; and\n\u00b7\nensuring that the manufacturing processes and facilities of the third parties with which we contract to manufacture our product candidates are in compliance with all relevant regulatory requirements, including those of the FDA.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays in our ability to obtain regulatory approval of N91115, including, but not limited to, denial of a new drug application, or NDA. We have never applied for, and have never received, regulatory approval for a drug. If we are unable to successfully complete the clinical development of N91115 and meet other related regulatory requirements, we will be unable to obtain approval of an NDA from the FDA. It is possible that, even if we successfully complete the clinical development of N91115, the FDA may refuse to accept our NDA for substantive review or may conclude after review of our data that our application is insufficient. If the FDA does not accept or approve our NDA, it may require that we conduct additional clinical, nonclinical or manufacturing studies or analyses and submit that data to it before it will reconsider our application. Depending on the extent of these or any other FDA requirements, approval of any NDA or application that we submit may be delayed by several years, or may require us to expend more resources than we have available. It is also possible that additional studies, if performed and completed, may not be considered sufficient by the FDA to approve our NDA.\nIn addition, the regulatory agencies may not complete their review processes in a timely manner, or additional delays may result if N91115 is brought before an FDA advisory committee, which could recommend restrictions on approval or recommend non-approval of the product candidate. In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action, or changes in regulatory agency policy during the period of product development, clinical studies and the review process. As a result, we cannot predict when, if at all, we will receive regulatory approval of any product candidate.\nAny delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing N91115, generating revenue and achieving and sustaining profitability. If any of these outcomes occur, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for N91115, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and could potentially cause us to cease operations. These factors could materially harm our business, and the value of our common stock would likely decline.\nOur lead product candidate, N91115, is initially being developed for a triple therapy of N91115 along with Vertex\u2019s lumacaftor/ivacaftor, and we may be unsuccessful in obtaining regulatory approval for, or commercially launching, N91115 if Vertex decides to withdraw or replace lumacaftor/ivacaftor in some or all geographic regions.\nOur initial development plans for N91115 focus on a triple therapy of N91115 along with Vertex\u2019s lumacaftor/ivacaftor, which was approved by the FDA on July 2, 2015, and by the European Union\u2019s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) on November 20, 2015. Consequently, the development of N91115 depends upon the successful commercialization of lumacaftor/ivacaftor in the U.S. and the commercial launch of lumacaftor/ivacaftor in other geographic regions. If Vertex is unable to, or decides to withdraw or replace lumacaftor/ivacaftor in any geographic region, this could prevent or significantly delay our ability to advance N91115 through clinical development to commercialization.\nWe have no agreements in place with Vertex, including any agreements to incentivize Vertex to proceed with its commercialization of lumacaftor/ivacaftor or to provide us with clinical supply of lumacaftor/ivacaftor, and our plans to develop N91115 have not been established in conjunction with Vertex. Vertex is not obligated in any way to continue with its currently disclosed plans and could stop the commercialization of lumacaftor/ivacaftor at any time. We have no control over Vertex\u2019s interactions with the FDA or other regulatory authorities and cannot intervene in that process. It is also possible that Vertex may experience a number of unforeseen events during their attempts to commercialize lumacaftor/ivacaftor that prevent it from pursuing commercialization or that impact successful commercialization. Vertex could decide to de-prioritize commercialization of lumacaftor/ivacaftor in relation to other projects, or deploy insufficient resources to support the commercialization of lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Also, Vertex could merge with a third party that decides to terminate or de-prioritize the commercialization of lumacaftor/ivacaftor. In any of such events, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts of N91115 or reinitiate our efforts to test administration of N91115 with different therapies. Any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business and could potentially cause us to cease operations.\nThe timing of the development of N91115 and its commercial launch may be significantly delayed if there are setbacks or delays in the commercialization of lumacaftor/ivacaftor.\nWe are dependent on publicly disclosed information with respect to Vertex\u2019s commercialization of lumacaftor/ivacaftor, and this may make it more difficult to evaluate our business and prospects at any given point in time, and could also impair our ability to raise capital on our desired timeline. The commercialization of lumacaftor/ivacaftor could encounter setbacks, which would significantly delay our plans to develop N91115, including the conduct and timely completion of clinical trials, ultimate approval and commercial marketing of N91115.\nEven if Vertex commercially launches lumacaftor/ivacaftor on a timely basis, we may be unsuccessful or significantly delayed in the development and commercial launch of N91115 if Vertex fails to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements or does not continue to produce or commercialize lumacaftor/ivacaftor, or we are otherwise unable to obtain lumacaftor/ivacaftor.\nThe development of N91115 also depends upon Vertex\u2019s continued compliance with regulatory requirements and the continued commercial availability of lumacaftor/ivacaftor for use in our clinical trials and for our commercialization efforts. Vertex\u2019s failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements could result in a major delay in, or prevent, the development and approval of N91115.\nVertex has no obligation to continue producing, commercializing or making lumacaftor/ivacaftor available to patients, or to continue producing lumacaftor/ivacaftor in any particular quantity, which could prevent our ability to obtain lumacaftor/ivacaftor for use in our planned clinical trials or impact the number of patients taking lumacaftor/ivacaftor who are available to enroll in our clinical trials. For example, Vertex may encounter manufacturing or other production issues and fail to produce enough lumacaftor/ivacaftor for us to successfully complete our studies and clinical trials, and this could cause our N91115 development program or commercialization efforts to fail or be significantly delayed. This could result in insufficient or no revenue and force us to pursue an alternative plan of business or cease operations entirely.\nWe may be unsuccessful or significantly delayed in the development and commercial launch of N91115 if there are not enough appropriate patients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor to conduct our clinical trials.\nIf there are not enough available patients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor to enroll in our clinical trials, we may be unable to advance N91115 through clinical development or be significantly delayed. Given the small patient\npopulation with CF and that the number of clinical trials being conducted at any given time is high, and is expected to increase, fewer patients will be available for any given clinical trial. Subjects may also drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate or we may discover that more patients than anticipated are required to complete our clinical trials.\nIn addition, if Vertex fails to gain reimbursement for lumacaftor/ivacaftor, there could be insufficient patients treated to conduct our clinical trials or enrollment in our clinical trials could take longer, and we may be forced to pay to obtain the drug for patients enrolling in our clinical trials, which could delay our clinical development, reduce the number of patients enrolling and require us to seek additional sources of funding to complete our development plans.\nPatients and their physicians may also conclude lumacaftor/ivacaftor is sufficiently effective on its own, leading to an insufficient number of patients available to enroll in our clinical trials, which would cause our clinical trials to fail or be delayed. Patients and their doctors may decide to wait for longer than we currently anticipate in order to evaluate the effect of lumacaftor/ivacaftor prior to enrolling in our clinical trials, which would significantly delay our N91115 development program. In addition, if physicians or patients do not perceive the benefits of lumacaftor/ivacaftor as clinically meaningful, this may negatively affect uptake and patients may stop taking lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Moreover, if only patients who are unsuccessfully treated on lumacaftor/ivacaftor decide to enroll in our clinical trials for N91115, our clinical trials may not be successful and could fail.\nAny of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business and could potentially cause us to cease operations.\nWe may be unsuccessful or significantly delayed in the development and commercial launch of N91115 if lumacaftor/ivacaftor has unexpected longer term safety or efficacy issues.\nOur plans for the development of N91115 depend on our expectation that lumacaftor/ivacaftor will be safe and effective, successfully marketed, physicians will prescribe lumacaftor/ivacaftor and patients will continue treatment. However, lumacaftor/ivacaftor could encounter unexpected results in the future and be associated with adverse outcomes or perceived lack of benefit during long-term use, forcing Vertex to amend its label or discontinue commercialization. This would have a material adverse effect on our business and could potentially cause us to cease operations.\nIf we pursue regulatory approval of N91115 for a triple therapy only along with lumacaftor/ivacaftor, and lumacaftor/ivacaftor subsequently becomes obsolete as a standard of care or its use is discontinued, we may be unsuccessful or significantly delayed in the development and commercial launch of N91115, or we may be forced to abandon or reinitiate our development efforts for N91115.\nOur initial development plans for N91115 focus on a triple therapy of N91115 along with lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Changes in standard of care or use patterns of lumacaftor/ivacaftor could make our triple therapy obsolete. If N91115 is approved specifically by indication from the FDA to be administered only along with lumacaftor/ivacaftor and use of another therapy becomes more prevalent than lumacaftor/ivacaftor, replaces lumacaftor/ivacaftor or makes a stabilizer obsolete, revenue from sales of N91115 could be negatively impacted and our financial results and stock price would be adversely affected. We may also be forced to abandon our development efforts of N91115 or reinitiate our efforts to test administration of N91115 along with a different drug. This would have a material adverse effect on our business and could potentially cause us to cease operations.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time-consuming and inherently unpredictable.\nWe are not permitted to market N91115 or any other potential product candidate in the United States or outside the United States until we receive approval of an NDA from the FDA or approval of a marketing application from the comparable regulatory authority in other countries. Prior to submitting an NDA to the FDA for approval of N91115, we will need to complete our ongoing preclinical and toxicology studies in CF, as well as all necessary clinical trials. We are still conducting ongoing preclinical studies and recently initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial. Successfully completing our Phase 2, and initiating and completing our Phase 3 clinical programs and obtaining approval of an NDA is a complex,\nlengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may delay, limit or deny approval of N91115 or any other potential product candidate for many reasons, including, among others:\n\u00b7\nthe results of our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistically significant and clinically meaningful efficacy with an acceptable safety profile as required by FDA, or other comparable regulatory authorities in other countries, for marketing approval;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA or other comparable regulatory authorities in other countries may disagree with the number, design, size, conduct or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA or other comparable regulatory authorities may find the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials insufficient to demonstrate that the potential clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA or other comparable regulatory authorities in other countries may disagree with our interpretation of data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA or other comparable regulatory authorities in other countries may not accept data generated at one or more of our clinical trial sites;\n\u00b7\nif our NDAs or similar applications, if and when submitted, are reviewed by FDA or other comparable regulatory authorities, as applicable, the regulatory authorities may have difficulties scheduling the necessary review meetings in a timely manner, may recommend against approval of our application or may recommend that the FDA or other comparable regulatory authorities, as applicable, require, as a condition of approval, additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, limitations on approved labeling or distribution and restrictions on use;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA may determine that our NDAs, if and when submitted, must follow a different regulatory pathway than we have attempted, and there may be potentially extended standards, timelines, and/or costs in order to pursue approval;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA may require development of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy as a condition of approval or post-approval, and other comparable regulatory authorities may grant only conditional approval or impose specific obligations as a condition for marketing authorization, or may require us to conduct post-authorization safety studies;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA or other comparable regulatory authorities may determine that the manufacturing processes or facilities of third party manufacturers with which we contract are not in compliance with all relevant regulatory requirements, including current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements; or\n\u00b7\nthe FDA or other comparable regulatory authorities may change their approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nAny of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, could jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and successfully market N91115 or any other potential product candidate. Moreover, because we are almost entirely dependent on N91115, any such setback in our pursuit of regulatory approval would have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nWe depend on the successful completion of clinical trials for N91115 or any other potential product candidate. The positive clinical results, if any, obtained by us in clinical trials may not be repeated in later-stage clinical trials.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of N91115 or any other potential product candidate, we must conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans. We have not completed the clinical trials necessary to support an application for approval to market our lead product candidate, N91115. Successful completion of such clinical trials is a prerequisite to submitting an NDA to the FDA and, consequently, the ultimate approval and commercial marketing of N91115 or any other potential product candidate. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later preclinical testing or clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many\ncompanies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval for their products.\nTo date, we have completed dose escalation and drug-drug interaction trials in healthy subjects and pharmacokinetic and dose-ranging safety trials in CF patients as part of our Phase 1 clinical program. We need to complete our ongoing preclinical and toxicology studies, as well as additional Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials prior to submitting N91115 for regulatory approval. We have conducted limited safety studies in humans to date and only recently commenced our planned Phase 2 trial to assess the efficacy and safety of N91115 in CF patients. We have not yet commenced our Phase 3 clinical program. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including those with greater resources and experience than us, have suffered significant setbacks in late stage clinical development, even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical trials.\nWe may experience a number of unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials for N91115 or any other potential product candidate that could adversely affect the completion of our clinical trials, including:\n\u00b7\nregulators, and/or institutional review boards or other reviewing bodies may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial, or to conduct or continue a clinical trial at a prospective or specific trial site;\n\u00b7\nour clinical trials are subject to review by the Protocol Review Committee, or PRC, of the Therapeutic Development Network of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation\u2019s Therapeutics Branch. The PRC may not sanction our trial for conduct at prospective trial sites or may provide a ranking that adversely impacts recruitment in our clinical trials compared with other investigational new drugs in CF;\n\u00b7\nclinical trials of N91115 or any other potential product candidate may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u00b7\nthe number of subjects required for clinical trials of N91115 or any other potential product candidate may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be insufficient or slower than we anticipate, particularly given the small patient population with CF and the number of clinical trials being conducted at any given time is high, and is expected to increase, leading to fewer available patients for any given clinical trial, or subjects may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u00b7\nour third party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u00b7\nwe might have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of N91115 or any other potential product candidate for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u00b7\nregulators, institutional review boards or data monitoring committees may require or recommend that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including safety signals or noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of clinical trials of N91115 or any other potential product candidate may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u00b7\nthe supply or quality of N91115 or any other potential product candidate or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate; and\n\u00b7\nN91115 or any other potential product candidate may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics.\nNegative or inconclusive results of our clinical trials of N91115, or any other clinical trial we conduct, could mandate repeated or additional clinical studies. Despite the safety results reported in earlier clinical trials for N91115, we do not know whether any other clinical trials we may conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety to result in regulatory approval to market N91115 or any other potential product candidate. If later stage clinical trials do not\nproduce favorable results, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for N91115 or any other potential product candidate may be adversely impacted.\nDelays in clinical trials are common and have many causes, and any delay could have a material adverse effect on our business such as increased costs and delays in our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commence product sales. We may be required to suspend, repeat or terminate our clinical trials if they are not conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, the results are negative or inconclusive or the trials are not well designed.\nClinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations or other applicable foreign government regulations, and are subject to oversight by the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities and institutional review boards at the medical institutions where the clinical trials are conducted. In addition, clinical trials must be conducted with product candidates produced under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and may require large numbers of test subjects.\nWe may experience delays in clinical trials at any stage of development and testing of N91115 or any other potential product candidate. We began our Phase 2 clinical trial in November 2015. Our other planned clinical trials may not begin on time, and our Phase 2 and other clinical trials may not have an effective design, enroll a sufficient number of patients or be completed on schedule, if at all.\nEvents, excluding our current dependence on the commercial launch of lumacaftor/ivacaftor in the U.S. and other geographic regions, which may result in a delay or unsuccessful completion of clinical trials for N91115, include:\n\u00b7\ninability to raise funding necessary to initiate or continue a trial;\n\u00b7\ndelays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u00b7\ndelays in reaching agreement with FDA or regulatory authorities in other countries on final trial design;\n\u00b7\ndelays in the review of our clinical trials by the PRC of the Therapeutic Development Network of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation\u2019s Therapeutic branch;\n\u00b7\nimposition of a clinical hold based on the submission of results of clinical and preclinical studies or following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7\ndelays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites;\n\u00b7\ndelays in obtaining required institutional review board approval at each site;\n\u00b7\ndelays in recruiting and retaining suitable subjects to participate in a trial;\n\u00b7\ndelays in having subjects complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u00b7\ndelays caused by subjects dropping out of a trial due to side effects or otherwise;\n\u00b7\nclinical sites dropping out of a trial to the detriment of enrollment;\n\u00b7\nstudy personnel may administer the wrong version of N91115 or other potential product candidate or assign study therapy to the wrong treatment group, resulting in disqualification of subjects from data analysis;\n\u00b7\nstudy personnel may not perform in accordance with good clinical practices;\n\u00b7\nN91115 or other potential product candidate may have unforeseen adverse side effects;\n\u00b7\ntime required to add new clinical sites; and\n\u00b7\ndelays by our contract manufacturers to produce and deliver sufficient supply of clinical trial materials.\nIf initiation or completion of any of our clinical trials, including our Phase 2 clinical trial of N91115, are delayed for any of the above reasons, our development may be arrested, development costs may increase, our approval\nprocess could be delayed, any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize N91115 or any other potential product candidate may be reduced and our competitors may have more time to bring products to market before we do or otherwise delay us. Any of these events could impair our ability to generate revenue from product sales and impair our ability to generate regulatory and commercialization milestones and royalties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nN91115 or any other potential product candidate may cause adverse events or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit the scope of any approved label or market acceptance.\nUndesirable adverse events caused by N91115 or any other potential product candidate could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay, halt or terminate clinical trials and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications. It is possible that during the course of the clinical development of N91115 or any other potential product candidate, results of our clinical trials could reveal an unacceptable severity and prevalence of adverse events. In addition, our remaining preclinical testing may produce inconclusive or negative safety results, which may require us to conduct additional preclinical testing or to abandon N91115 or other potential product candidate. Also, N91115 or any other potential product candidate may have unfavorable pharmacology or toxicity characteristics, or cause undesirable side effects.\nUndesirable adverse events caused by N91115 or any other potential product candidate could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete a clinical trial or result in potential product liability claims. In addition, adverse events that occur in our trials as a consequence of the serious disease that is being studied may negatively affect the profile of N91115 or any other potential product candidate. The FDA or other regulatory authorities may determine that additional safety testing is required for N91115 or any other potential product candidate, which would cause a delay in our clinical development of such product candidate.\nAdditionally if N91115 or any other potential product candidate receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable adverse events caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may withdraw approval of N91115 or any other potential product candidate or impose restrictions on their distribution in the form of a modified risk evaluation and mitigation strategy;\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may require additional labeling, such as warnings or contraindications;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to change the way the product is administered or to conduct additional clinical studies;\n\u00b7\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u00b7\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects. Any such events would increase our costs and could delay or prevent our ability to commercialize our product candidates, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nN91115 and any other potential product candidate based on our GSNOR inhibitor portfolio are based on a novel technology, which may raise development issues we may not anticipate or be able to resolve, and regulatory issues that could delay or prevent approval.\nN91115 and any other potential product candidate based on our GSNOR inhibitor technology platform are based on a novel technology, and there can be no assurance that unforeseen development problems related to our novel technology will not arise in the future and cause significant delays. We may be unable to resolve any such unforeseen problems.\nRegulatory approval of novel product candidates can be more expensive and take longer than other, more well-known or extensively studied pharmaceutical product candidates due to our and regulatory agencies\u2019 lack of experience with them. There are no other GSNOR inhibitors that we know of in clinical development and none have been approved to date. The novelty of our platform may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to conduct additional studies or clinical trials, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of N91115 or any other potential product candidate\nbased on our GSNOR inhibitor technology platform or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. For example, the FDA could require additional studies or characterization that may be difficult or impossible to perform.\nIf we are not able to obtain orphan product status for N91115 in the EU and any other potential product candidate in the US or EU for which we seek this status, we will not be able to claim the tax credits for our clinical trials of such product candidate provided by this status or potentially take advantage of other benefits of orphan drug status.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and the European Union, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States who have been diagnosed as having the disease or condition at the time of the submission of the request for orphan drug designation. Under Regulation No. (EC) 141/2000 on Orphan Medicinal Products, a medicinal product may be designated as an orphan medicinal product if, among other things, it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the European Union when the application is made. Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of market exclusivity. This exclusivity precludes the EMA or the FDA, as applicable, from approving another marketing application for the same or, in the European Union, a similar drug for the same indication for that time period, unless, among other things, the later product is clinically superior. The applicable period is seven years in the United States and ten years in the European Union following marketing approval. The EU exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, for example if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified.\nWe own exclusive rights to N91115 in the United States and all other major markets, including U.S. composition of matter patent protection until at least 2031. The potential benefits conferred by orphan status are that it may allow us to benefit from an exclusive marketing period should our patents not be enforceable or subject to challenge and it provides for tax credits for certain clinical trial expenses that can be applied against future revenue, if any.\nIn the United States, orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA withdraws or revokes the orphan drug designation as permitted by law, we withdraw the marketing application for the drug, we consent to another\u2019s marketing application for approval of the same use or indication as the designated orphan drug, or we fail to assure a sufficient quantity of the drug as required by law. Similarly, in the European Union, exclusivity may be lost if we request the removal of the orphan drug designation or the drug no longer meets any of the criteria that made it eligible for orphan drug status at the outset. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the same or, in the European Union, a similar drug can subsequently be approved for the same condition if the competent regulatory agency concludes that the later drug is clinically superior to the original orphan drug by providing a significant therapeutic advantage over and above that drug.\nWe were granted orphan drug designation for N91115 by the FDA in January 2016. We intend to seek orphan drug designation in the EU for N91115 and may seek an orphan drug designation for other potential product candidates. If we lose orphan drug exclusivity for N91115 in the United States or are unable to obtain and maintain orphan drug designation in the EU for N91115 or for any other product candidates for which we seek a designation, or if our competitors obtain orphan drug exclusivity for other rare diseases or conditions we are targeting before we do, we may be delayed in obtaining marketing authorization or we may lose out on the potential benefits of market exclusivity associated with the orphan drug designation.\nWe may not retain fast track designation by the FDA for N91115 or any other potential product candidate for which we seek such designation. If granted, fast track designation may not actually lead to a faster development, regulatory review or approval.\nIf a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need, the sponsor may apply for FDA fast track designation. The FDA has broad discretion whether or not to grant this designation. We were granted fast track designation by the FDA for N91115 in February 2016, and we may seek fast track designation for other potential product candidates in the future. Even with fast track designation, however, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. The FDA may also withdraw fast track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program.\nWe may not be granted a breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA for N91115 or any other potential product candidate. If granted, a breakthrough therapy designation may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval, and it will not increase the likelihood that N91115 or any other potential product candidate will receive regulatory approval.\nWe intend to seek a breakthrough therapy designation for N91115, and we may do so for other potential product candidates as well. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. For product candidates that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed on ineffective control regimens. Product candidates designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA are also eligible for accelerated approval.\nDesignation as a breakthrough therapy is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe N91115 or any other potential product candidate meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. The availability of breakthrough therapy designation was established with the passage of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, and while the FDA has released guidance as to the criteria it uses in designating drugs as breakthrough therapies, we cannot be sure that N91115 or any other potential product candidate will meet the FDA\u2019s qualifying criteria for such designation. In any event, the receipt of a breakthrough therapy designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if N91115 or any other potential product candidate qualifies as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may later decide that the products no longer meet the conditions for such qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for N91115 or any other potential product candidate, we will still face extensive ongoing regulatory requirements.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval in the United States, the FDA may still impose significant future restrictions on the indicated uses or marketing of N91115 or any other potential product candidate, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance, including Phase 4 clinical trials. Should we obtain regulatory approval for N91115 or any other potential product candidate, we will be subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing the labeling, manufacturing, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, record-keeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information. The holder of an approved NDA is obligated to monitor and report adverse events and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA. The holder of an approved NDA must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. Advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules and are subject to FDA review, in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws.\nIn addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to payment of user fees and continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMPs, and adherence to commitments made in the NDA. If we, or a regulatory agency, discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as quality issues or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions relative to that product or the manufacturing facility, including necessitating recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable ongoing regulatory requirements following approval of a product candidate, a regulatory agency may:\n\u00b7\nissue an untitled or warning letter asserting that we are in violation of the law;\n\u00b7\nseek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u00b7\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u00b7\nsuspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nrefuse to approve a pending NDA or supplements to an NDA submitted by us; or\n\u00b7\ndemand recall and/or seize product.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize N91115 or any other potential product candidate and inhibit our ability to generate revenue.\nThe approval of N91115 or any other potential product candidate in any given market does not ensure approval in any other market.\nIn order to market any product candidate, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements on a country-by-country basis regarding safety and efficacy. Approval in the United States by the FDA or by a regulatory agency in another country does not ensure approval by the regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or ensure approval for the same conditions of use. In addition, clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not guarantee regulatory approval in any other country. Approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approval could result in difficulties and costs for us and require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials which could be costly and time-consuming. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our product candidates in those countries. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale in any jurisdiction, including international markets, and we do not have experience in obtaining regulatory approval in international markets. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, or if regulatory approvals in international markets are delayed, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates will be unrealized.\nRisks Related to Manufacturing and Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely on third party contract manufacturers, including a single source supplier for one of our manufacturing processes, which limits our ability to control the availability of, and manufacturing costs for, N91115 and any other potential product candidate.\nWe do not own or operate, and we do not expect to own or operate, facilities for product manufacturing, storage, distribution or testing. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third party manufacturers to manufacture and distribute our product candidates for clinical trials. We obtain N91115 to meet our clinical supply needs through a third party manufacturing network. Our supply chain for N91115 includes a sole source supplier for one of our manufacturing processes. A disruption in the clinical supply of N91115 could delay the completion of clinical trials and impact timelines for filing an NDA and comparable foreign regulatory submissions. We cannot be certain that we will be able to establish sufficient sources for manufacturing all of our N91115 supply needs on a timely basis or at all.\nWe intend to rely on these manufacturers to produce commercial supplies of our product candidates that are approved and commercialized. As a result of our reliance on these third party manufacturers and suppliers, including a sole source supplier of one of our manufacturing processes, we could be subject to significant supply disruptions outside of our control. Our supply chain for sourcing raw materials and manufacturing drug product ready for distribution is a multi-step international endeavor. Third party contract manufacturers, including some in China, supply us with raw materials, and contract manufacturers in the United States, Canada and China convert these raw materials into drug substance and convert the drug substance into final dosage form. Establishing and managing this supply chain requires a significant financial commitment and the creation and maintenance of numerous third party contractual relationships. Although we attempt to effectively manage the business relationships with companies in our supply chain, we do not have control over their operations.\nSupply disruptions may result from a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe inability of a supplier to provide raw materials;\n\u00b7\nequipment malfunctions or failures at the facilities of any future collaborators or suppliers;\n\u00b7\nhigh process failure rates;\n\u00b7\ninability to meet our product specifications and quality requirements consistently;\n\u00b7\ndamage to facilities due to natural or man-made disasters;\n\u00b7\nchanges in regulatory requirements or standards that require modifications to any future collaborators\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 manufacturing processes;\n\u00b7\naction by regulatory authorities or by us that results in the halting or slowdown of production of components or finished product at our facilities or the facilities of future collaborators or suppliers;\n\u00b7\nproblems that delay or prevent manufacturing technology transfer to another facility, contract manufacturer or future collaborator with subsequent delay or inability to start up a commercial facility;\n\u00b7\na contract manufacturer or supplier going out of business, undergoing a capacity shortfall or otherwise failing to produce product as contractually required;\n\u00b7\nemployee or contractor misconduct or negligence; and\n\u00b7\nshipping delays, losses or interruptions.\nFurther, if our contract manufacturers are not in compliance with regulatory requirements at any stage, including post approval, we may be fined, forced to remove a product from the market and/or experience other adverse consequences, including delays, which could materially harm our business.\nDifficulties or delays in our contract manufacturers\u2019 production of drug substances could delay our clinical trials, cause delays in the approval of our product candidates, increase our costs, damage our reputation, interrupt or cease commercial supply and cause us to lose revenue and market share if we are unable to timely meet market demand for any products that are approved for sale.\nAlternative manufacturers may not exist should we need them. If we utilize alternative manufacturers or alternative materials and processes, we may be subject to additional regulatory requirements, manufacturing delays and increased costs.\nBecause manufacturing processes are highly complex and are subject to a lengthy regulatory approval process, alternative qualified production capacity and sufficiently trained or qualified personnel may not be available on a timely or cost-effective basis or at all should we require them. If we utilize an alternative manufacturer or alternative component, we may be required to demonstrate comparability of the products and product candidates before releasing them for clinical use and we may not be able to find an alternative supplier. The loss of any of our current suppliers could result in manufacturing delays for the component substitution, and we may need to accept changes in terms or price from our existing supplier in order to avoid such delays.\nWe lack experience, and may experience difficulties managing our manufacturing processes.\nWe are an early stage company and do not have significant experience managing the complex manufacturing processes necessary for the development of our product candidates. We expect to need managerial, operational and other resources to oversee our manufacturing processes and relationships. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize N91115 or any other potential product candidate and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth, including with respect to our manufacturing processes, effectively. We may not be able to accomplish this, and our failure to accomplish any of them could prevent us from successfully growing our company.\nOur contract manufacturers may develop independently or jointly with us proprietary processes, which could increase our reliance on such manufacturers or increase our costs should we be required to obtain a license to have the drug manufactured by an alternative manufacturer.\nIn the course of providing its services, a contract manufacturer may develop process technology related to the manufacture of N91115 or any other potential product candidate that the manufacturer owns, either independently or jointly with us. This would increase our reliance on that manufacturer or require us to obtain a license from that manufacturer in order to have our product candidates manufactured by other suppliers utilizing the same process.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and some of our clinical trials. These third parties may not perform as contractually required or expected and issues may arise that could delay the completion of clinical trials and impact regulatory approval for N91115.\nWe sometimes rely on third parties, such as CROs, medical institutions, academic institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories, to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. We are responsible for confirming that our preclinical studies are conducted in accordance with applicable regulations and that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its general investigational plan and protocol. The FDA requires us to comply with Good Laboratory Practices for conducting and recording the results of our preclinical studies and Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are accurate and that the clinical trial participants are adequately protected. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities. If the third parties conducting our clinical trials do not perform their contractual duties or obligations, do not meet expected deadlines, fail to comply with GCP, do not adhere to our clinical trial protocols or otherwise fail to generate reliable clinical data, we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties and our clinical trials may be more costly than expected or budgeted, extended, delayed or terminated or may need to be repeated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize the product candidate being tested in such trials.\nOur CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical studies or other drug development activities that could harm our competitive position. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is comprised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements, or for any other reasons, our clinical studies may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nFurther, if our contract manufacturers are not in compliance with regulatory requirements at any stage, including post-marketing approval, we may be fined, forced to remove a product from the market and/or experience other adverse consequences, including delays, which could materially harm our business.\nDuring the course of the product life cycle we will make process changes to scale up manufacturing to commercial quantities or transfer the production to alternate sites or contract manufacturers. Our ability to successfully implement these changes will depend on our ability to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the FDA and other regulatory agencies, that the product made by the new process or at the new site is comparable to the original product.\nIn the event that manufacturing process changes are necessary for the further development of a product candidate, we may not be able to reach agreement with regulatory agencies on the criteria for demonstrating comparability to the original product, which would require us to repeat clinical studies performed with the original product. This could result in lengthy delays in implementing the new process or site and substantial lost revenue as a result of our inability to meet commercial demand. If we reach agreement with regulatory agencies on the criteria for establishing comparability, we may not be able to meet these criteria or may suffer lengthy delays in meeting these criteria. This may result in significant lost revenue due to inability to meet commercial demand with the original product. Furthermore, studies to demonstrate comparability, or any other studies on the new process or site such as validation studies, may uncover findings that result in regulatory agencies delaying or refusing to approve the new process or site.\nWe may explore future collaborations with third parties for the development and commercialization of N91115 or another potential product candidate. If we are unable to form such collaborations or they are not successful, we may not be able to complete the development of these product candidates.\nWe do not currently have any collaboration agreements for the development of N91115 or any other potential product candidate, but we may seek third party collaborators in the future.\nWe face a number of challenges in seeking future collaborations. Collaborations are complex and any potential discussions may not result in a definitive agreement for many reasons. For example, whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration, and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors, such as the design or results of our clinical trials, the potential market for our product candidates, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering our product candidates to patients, the potential of competing products or\nproduct candidates, the existence of uncertainty with respect to ownership or the coverage of our intellectual property, and industry and market conditions generally. If we determine that additional collaborations for N91115 or any other potential product candidate are necessary and are unable to enter into such collaborations on acceptable terms, we might elect to delay or scale back the development or commercialization of our product candidates in order to preserve our financial resources or to allow us adequate time to develop the required resources and systems and expertise ourselves.\nCollaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner, or at all. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators. If a future collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development or commercialization program could be delayed, diminished or terminated.\nIf any such collaborations are established in the future, we may have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development of N91115 and any other potential product candidate. This is also likely to be true in any future collaborations with third parties once any of our product candidates are commercialized. Our ability to generate revenue from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators\u2019 abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.\nCollaborations involving our product candidates pose the following risks to us:\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of N91115 or any other potential product candidate, or may elect not to continue development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborator\u2019s strategic focus or available funding, or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u00b7\ndisputes may arise between the collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of N91115 or any other potential product candidate, or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources;\n\u00b7\ncollaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidate;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may elect to take over manufacturing rather than retain us as manufacturers and may encounter problems in starting up or gaining approval for their manufacturing operation and so be unable to continue development of N91115 or any other potential product candidate;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to undertake the expenditure of substantial operational, financial and managerial resources in connection with any collaboration;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to issue equity securities to collaborators that would dilute our existing stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to assume substantial actual or contingent liabilities;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may not commit adequate resources to the marketing and distribution of our product candidates, limiting our potential revenue from N91115 or any other potential product candidate; and\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may experience financial difficulties.\nRisks Relating to Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nThe market opportunity for N91115 is limited by the age groups and geographic regions in which lumacaftor/ivacaftor is approved and commercialized, and also depends on the longer term success of lumacaftor/ivacaftor.\nN91115 is initially being targeted for a triple therapy of N91115 along with lumacaftor/ivacaftor in CF patients homozygous fordel. Consequently, N91115 will be administered to patients taking lumacaftor/ivacaftor in the patient populations and in the countries for which this therapy has received approval and has been commercialized. For example, we cannot test N91115 for safety and efficacy in a triple therapy along with lumacaftor/ivacaftor in the pediatric population until lumacaftor/ivacaftor has received approval for that population. This limitation could result in a negative impact on the revenue generated from N91115 and our financial results and stock price would be adversely affected. Further, if use of another therapy becomes more prevalent than lumacaftor/ivacaftor or makes lumacaftor/ivacaftor obsolete, revenue could be negatively impacted and our financial results and stock price would be adversely affected.\nN91115 or any other potential product candidate in CF may depend, in part, on whether CF therapies other than lumacaftor/ivacaftor are developed and commercially launched, and also depend on the longer term success of these therapies.\nIn addition to lumacaftor and ivacaftor, there are other CF therapies currently under development or that may be developed in the future, including Vertex\u2019s VX-661/ivacaftor combination and Vertex\u2019s second generation correctors. We may expand the development of N91115 by testing it with additional CF therapies that we deem appropriate if, and as, they become commercially available and we may do the same with any potential product candidate other than N91115. We would, therefore, be dependent on the approval, commercialization and success of these other CF therapies, as well as the patient populations and countries for which such therapies received approval and were commercialized.\nIn addition, should we administer N91115 or any other potential product candidate with any other CF therapies, we would be subject to numerous additional risks. For example, the other therapies may lead to toxicities that are improperly attributed to our product candidate or the administration of our product candidate with such other therapies may result in toxicities that such other therapies do not produce when used alone. Other therapies with which we may administer our product candidate could be removed from the market and thus be unavailable for testing or commercial use. Testing our product candidate with other therapies may increase the risk of significant adverse effects or test failures. The timing, outcome and cost of developing a product candidate to be used with other therapies is difficult to predict and dependent on a number of factors that are outside our reasonable control. If we experience efficacy, safety or toxicity issues in our clinical trials or with any other therapies, we may not receive approval to market our product candidate, which could prevent us from ever generating revenue or achieving profitability. These limitations could result in a negative impact on our revenue and our financial results and stock price would be adversely affected.\nThe commercial success of N91115 and any other potential product candidate will depend upon the acceptance of those products, if approved, by the medical community, including physicians, patients and healthcare payers.\nEven if N91115 or any other potential product candidate is approved for sale, it may nevertheless fail to achieve sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payers and others in the medical community. If these product candidates, if approved, do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenue and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of N91115 or any other potential product candidate will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\ndemonstration of safety and efficacy in our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe relative convenience, ease of administration and acceptance by physicians, patients and healthcare payers;\n\u00b7\nthe prevalence and severity of any adverse effects;\n\u00b7\nlimitations or warnings contained in the FDA-approved label for the relevant product candidate;\n\u00b7\navailability of alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\npricing and cost-effectiveness;\n\u00b7\nthe effectiveness of our or any future collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategies; and\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain and maintain payer approval, sufficient third party coverage or reimbursement, which may vary from country to country.\nIf N91115 or any other potential product candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, patients and healthcare payers, we may not generate sufficient revenue and we may not become or remain profitable.\nWe lack marketing experience, and may be unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to sell and market N91115 or any other potential product candidate, and we may not be successful in commercializing N91115 or any other potential product candidate if and when approved.\nWe do not have a sales or marketing infrastructure, and we have limited experience in the sales, marketing or distribution of pharmaceutical products. Our commercialization strategy will target key prescribing physicians and advocacy groups, as well as provide patients with support programs, ensure product access and help secure reimbursement. In the future, we may choose to build a focused sales and marketing infrastructure to market or co-promote N91115 or any other potential product candidate if and when approved, which would be expensive and time-consuming. Alternatively, we may elect to outsource these functions to third parties. Either approach carries significant risks. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time-consuming and, if done improperly, could delay a product launch and result in limited sales or failure to satisfy complex legal standards. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel. Outside of North America and Europe, we may seek a partner to commercialize our products.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize N91115 or any other potential product candidate on our own include:\n\u00b7\ninability to recruit, manage and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u00b7\nthe inability of marketing personnel to develop effective marketing strategies;\n\u00b7\nthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future products;\n\u00b7\nthe lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u00b7\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nWe may also not be successful in entering into additional arrangements with third parties to sell and market N91115 or any other potential product candidate or doing so on terms that are favorable to us. Even if we do enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing and distribution services, our product revenue or the profitability of N91115 or any other potential product candidate is likely to be lower than if we were to market and sell our products ourselves. In addition, we likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates.\nCompetitive products for the treatment of CF may reduce or eliminate the commercial opportunity for N91115 or any other potential product candidate. If our competitors develop technologies or product candidates more rapidly than we do or their technologies, including delivery technologies, are more effective or safer than ours, our ability to develop and successfully commercialize our product may be adversely affected.\nThe clinical and commercial landscape for CF is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. New data from clinical stage products continue to emerge. It is possible that these data may alter the current standard of care, completely precluding us from further developing N91115 or any other potential product candidate for cystic fibrosis. Further, it is possible that we may initiate a clinical trial or trials for N91115 or any other potential product candidate only to find that data from competing products make it impossible for us to complete enrollment in clinical trials, resulting in our inability to file for marketing approval with regulatory agencies. Even if N91115 or any other potential product candidate is approved, it may have limited sales due to particularly intense competition in the CF market.\nWe are initially developing N91115 for a triple therapy of N91115 along with lumacaftor/ivacaftor for CF patients. Changes in standard of care or use patterns could make our triple therapy obsolete. If N91115 is approved for administration along with lumacaftor/ivacaftor and use of another therapy becomes more prevalent than lumacaftor/ivacaftor, sales of N91115 could be negatively impacted and our financial results and stock price would be adversely affected.\nCompetitive therapeutic treatments include those that are currently in development and any new treatments that enter the market. We believe that a significant number of products are currently under development, and may become commercially available in the future, for the treatment of conditions for which we may try to develop product candidates. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions. We are aware of several disease modifying CF therapies in development, including those of Vertex Pharmaceuticals, PTC Therapeutics, Novartis, Pfizer, Galapagos, ProQR Therapeutics, Flatley Discovery Labs, Parion Sciences, Concert, Proteostasis, Calista, Shire, Gilead Sciences, AbbVie, AmpliPhi Biosciences and F. Hoffmann-LaRoche.\nMany of our competitors have greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales and supply resources, and human resources or experience than us and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for therapies and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors\u2019 products may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any product candidate we may commercialize and may render our therapies obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover development and commercialization expenses.\nIf our lead product candidate, N91115, is approved for the indications we are currently pursuing, it could compete with a range of therapeutic treatments that are in development. For example, although N91115 is being developed for a triple therapy of N91115 along with lumacaftor/ivacaftor, Vertex is developing other combinations that may obviate the applicability of N91115.\nIf we obtain approval for any product candidate, we will face competition based on many different factors, including the efficacy, safety and tolerability of our products, the ease with which our products can be administered and the extent to which patients accept relatively new routes of administration, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals for these products, the availability and cost of manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities, price, reimbursement coverage and patent position. Competing products could present superior treatment alternatives, including being more effective, safer, less expensive or marketed and sold more effectively than any products we may develop. Competitive products may make any products we develop obsolete or noncompetitive before we recover the expense of developing and commercializing our product candidates. Such competitors could also recruit our employees, which could negatively impact our level of expertise and our ability to execute our business plan. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of competitors.\nWe also compete with other clinical stage companies and institutions for clinical trial participants, which could reduce our ability to recruit participants for our clinical trials. Delay in recruiting clinical trial participants could adversely affect our ability to bring a product to market prior to our competitors. Further, research and discoveries by\nothers may result in breakthroughs that render our product candidates obsolete even before they begin to generate any revenue.\nIn addition, our competitors may obtain patent protection, regulatory exclusivities, or FDA approval and commercialize products more rapidly than we do, which may impact future sales of any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval. If the FDA approves the commercial sale of any of our product candidates, we will also be competing with respect to marketing capabilities and manufacturing efficiency, areas in which we have limited or no experience. We expect competition among products will be based on product efficacy and safety, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, availability of supply, marketing and sales capabilities, product price, reimbursement coverage by government and private third party payers, regulatory exclusivities and patent position. Our profitability and financial position will suffer if our products receive regulatory approval, but cannot compete effectively in the marketplace.\nFurthermore, regulatory authorities\u2019 assessment of the data and results required to demonstrate safety and efficacy can change over time and can be affected by many factors, such as the emergence of new information, including on other products, changing policies and agency funding, staffing and leadership. We cannot be sure whether future changes to the regulatory environment will be favorable or unfavorable to our business prospects. For example, average review times at the FDA for marketing approval applications can be affected by a variety of factors, including budget and funding levels and statutory, regulatory and policy changes.\nPayer approval and reimbursement may not be available for N91115 or any other potential product candidate, which could make it difficult for us to sell our product candidates profitably.\nObtaining formulary approval can be a complex and time-consuming process. We cannot be certain if and when we will obtain formulary approval to allow us to sell N91115 or any other potential product candidate into our target markets. Failure to obtain timely formulary approval and appropriate coverage will limit our commercial success.\nFurthermore, market acceptance and sales of N91115, or any other potential product candidate that we develop, will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third party payers, such as private health insurers, managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit management organizations, decide which medications they will pay for, at what tier level and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and these third party payers have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third party payers are requiring that companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product for which we obtain marketing approval. Obtaining reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices already associated with CFTR modulators in CF, as well as those often associated with products administered under the supervision of a physician in general. Also, reimbursement amounts may reduce the demand for, or the price of, our products. If reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize N91115 or any other potential product candidate that we develop. We will also be required to establish systems and programs that assist patients in determining the reimbursement level and in some instances establishing patient economic support programs to alleviate the economic burden of co-pays and/or co-insurance. These patient support programs are complex, costly and require knowledge and expertise that we currently do not possess.\nThere have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in the United States and in some foreign jurisdictions that could affect our ability to sell any future products profitably. These legislative and regulatory changes may negatively impact the reimbursement for any future products, following approval. The availability of generic treatments may also substantially reduce the likelihood of reimbursement for N91115 or any other potential product candidate. The application of user fees to generic drug products will likely expedite the approval of additional generic drug treatments. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of N91115 and any other potential product candidate that we develop, due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care and additional legislative changes.\nIn addition, there may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for approved products, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or regulatory authorities in other countries. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any product will be paid for in all cases or at a\nrate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Payment rates may vary according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on payments allowed for lower cost products that are already reimbursed, and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payers and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of products from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third party payers often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies.\nOur inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from both government funded and private payers for any of N91115 and any other potential product candidate could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nThe success of our business depends primarily on our ability to identify, develop and commercialize one or more product candidates. Because we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on research programs and product candidates for the indications that take advantage of our team\u2019s deep expertise and knowledge and that we believe are the most scientifically and commercially promising. We are initially developing N91115 for a triple therapy of N91115 along with lumacaftor/ivacaftor for CF patients. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable scientific or commercial products or profitable market opportunities. In addition, we may spend valuable time and managerial and financial resources on research programs and product candidates for specific indications that ultimately do not yield any scientifically or commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the scientific and commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in situations where it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole rights to development and commercialization or miss out on the commercial opportunity entirely.\nRisks Relating to Regulation of Our Industry\nThe pharmaceutical industry is subject to significant regulation and oversight in the United States, in addition to approval of products for sale and marketing.\nIn addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes.\nThe federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying anything of value, directly or indirectly, in return for the referral of any services or acquisition of any good reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or another federal healthcare program. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations that implicate federal healthcare programs may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. To qualify for a safe harbor, the activity must fit squarely within the safe harbor. Arrangements that do not meet a safe harbor are not necessarily illegal but will be evaluated in a case by case basis. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability.\nFederal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of marketing of the product for unapproved, or off-label, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. Sanctions under\nthese federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer\u2019s products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines, imprisonment, and other sanctions. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and health information privacy and security laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nIf we obtain FDA approval for any of our product candidates and begin commercializing those products in the United States, our operations may be directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal anti-kickback statute. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u00b7\nthe federal healthcare anti-kickback statute which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or certain rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u00b7\nthe federal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent or from knowingly making a false statement to improperly avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) which, among other things, imposes criminal liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payer (e.g., public or private) and knowingly or willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statement using or making any false or fraudulent document, in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters;\n\u00b7\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) and its implementing regulations, and as amended again by the final HIPAA omnibus rule, Modifications to the HIPAA Privacy, Security, Enforcement, and Breach Notification Rules Under HITECH and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act; Other Modifications to HIPAA, published in January 2013, which imposes certain obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization by entities subject to the rule, such as health plans, clearinghouses and healthcare providers;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, which prohibits, among other things, the adulteration or misbranding of drugs and medical devices;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Health Care Reform Law), and its implementing regulations, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies to report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services information related to\npayments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and\n\u00b7\nanalogous state laws and regulations, including: state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by state governmental and non-governmental third party payers, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; and state laws and regulations that require manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information, which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, provide accurate information to the FDA, comply with manufacturing standards we have established, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nHealthcare reform measures could adversely affect our business.\nIn the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. Most recently, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, was enacted, which includes measures to significantly change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the ACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are the following:\n\u00b7\nan annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;\n\u00b7\nnew requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and others, including reporting any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers and reporting any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;\n\u00b7\na new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;\n\u00b7\ncreation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board which, beginning in 2014, has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs and those recommendations could have the effect of law even if Congress does not act on the recommendations; and\n\u00b7\nestablishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.\nAt this time, the full effect that the ACA would have on our business remains unclear.\nIndividual states have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third party payers or other restrictions could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce ultimate demand for our products or put pressure on our product pricing, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIn addition, given recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of healthcare, Congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on healthcare reform, the cost of prescription drugs and biologics and the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. While we cannot predict the full outcome of any such legislation, it may result in decreased reimbursement for drugs and biologics, which may further exacerbate industry-wide pressure to reduce prescription drug prices. This could harm our ability to generate revenue. Increases in importation or re-importation of pharmaceutical products from foreign countries into the United States could put competitive pressure on our ability to profitably price our products, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. We might elect not to seek approval for or market our products in foreign jurisdictions in order to minimize the risk of re-importation, which could also reduce the revenue we generate from our product sales. It is also possible that other legislative proposals having similar effects will be adopted.\nRisks Relating to Protecting Our Intellectual Property\nIt is difficult and expensive to protect our intellectual property rights and we cannot ensure that they will prevent third parties from competing against us.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property rights, both in the United States and other countries, successfully defend this intellectual property against third party challenges and successfully enforce this intellectual property to prevent third party infringement. We rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements.\nOur ability to protect any of our product candidates and technologies from unauthorized or infringing use by third parties depends in substantial part on our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents in both the United States and other countries. Patent matters in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Changes in either the patent laws, implementing regulations or in interpretations of patent laws may diminish the value of our patent rights.\nThere can be no assurance that we will discover or develop patentable products or processes or that patents will issue from any pending patent applications owned or licensed by us or any patent applications we may own or license in the future, or if issued, that the breadth of such patent coverage will be sufficient. We cannot guarantee that claims of issued patents owned or licensed to us, either now or in the future, are or will be held valid or enforceable by the courts or, even if unchallenged, will provide us with exclusivity or commercial value for our product candidates or technology or any significant protection against competitive products or prevent others from designing around our claims. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market our product candidates under patent protection could be reduced. Our patent rights also depend on our compliance with technology and patent\nlicenses upon which our patent rights are based and upon the validity of assignments of patent rights from consultants and other inventors that were, or are, not employed by us.\nPatent applications are generally maintained in confidence until publication. In the United States, for example, patent applications are maintained in secrecy for up to 18 months after their filing. Similarly, publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lag behind actual discoveries. Consequently, we cannot be certain that we were the first to invent, or the first to file patent applications on our product candidates. There is also no assurance that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found, which could be used by a third party to challenge validity of our patents or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application.\nIn addition, even if patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge any patent we own or license through adversarial proceedings in the issuing offices, which could result in the invalidation or unenforceability of some or all of the relevant patent claims. If a third party asserts a substantial new question of patentability against any claim of a United States patent we own or license, the USPTO may grant a request for reexamination, which may result in a loss of scope of some claims or a loss of the entire patent. The adoption of the America Invents Act has established additional opportunities for third parties to invalidate United States patent claims, including inter partes review and post-grant review, on the basis of a lower legal standards than reexamination and additional grounds.\nWe will incur significant ongoing expenses in maintaining our patent portfolio. Should we lack the funds to maintain our patent portfolio or to enforce our rights against infringers, we could be adversely impacted. Even if claims of infringement are without merit, any such action could divert the time and attention of management and impair our ability to access additional capital and/or cost us significant funds to defend.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on all of our product candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may manufacture and sell our potential products in those foreign countries where we have not filed for patent protection or where patent protection may be unavailable, not obtainable or ultimately not enforceable. Our competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets and, further, may be able to export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.\nOur patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications in countries outside of the United States, including Europe, Canada, Japan and Australia. The scope of coverage provided by these patents varies from country to country. Moreover, the laws of some foreign jurisdictions do not provide intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the United States and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in obtaining such rights in foreign jurisdictions. Outside of the United States, patents we own or license may become subject to patent opposition in the European Patent Office or similar proceedings, which may result in loss of scope of some claims or loss of the entire patent. Participation in adversarial proceedings is very complex, expensive, and may divert our management\u2019s attention from our core business and may result in unfavorable outcomes that could adversely affect our ability to prevent third parties from competing with us.\nMany companies have also encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to pharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. For example, an April 2014 report from the Office of the United States Trade Representative identified a number of countries, including India and China, where challenges to the procurement and enforcement of patent rights have been reported. Several countries, including India and China, have been listed in the report every year since 1989. If we encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions, our business prospects could be substantially harmed. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in certain foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u00b7\nOthers may be able to make compounds that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u00b7\nWe or our licensors or strategic collaborators might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u00b7\nWe or our licensors or strategic collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\u00b7\nOthers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nIt is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n\u00b7\nIssued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;\n\u00b7\nOur competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u00b7\nWe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and\n\u00b7\nThe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nShould any of these events occur, they could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nRecent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nOn September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy- Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business, our current and pending patent portfolio and future intellectual property strategy. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, the European Patent Office, or EPO, and other foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign national or international patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of patent rights include, but are not limited to, failure to timely file national and regional stage patent applications based on our international patent application, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we or our licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our product candidates, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSome of our intellectual property is licensed to us by a third party. If we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreement under which we license intellectual property rights from that third party, or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensor, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe have a license under certain patents and/or know-how to develop and commercialize certain of our potential product candidates. Our existing license agreements impose, and we expect that any future license agreements will impose on us, various obligations. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license. If any of our licenses are terminated and we are not able to negotiate other agreements for use of the intellectual property protections underlying these product candidates, we would not be able to manufacture and market these potential products, which would adversely affect our business prospects and financial condition.\nThe patent protection and patent prosecution for some of our potential product candidates is dependent or may be dependent in the future on third parties.\nWhile we normally seek and gain the right to fully prosecute the patents relating to our potential product candidates, there may be times when platform technology patents or product-specific patents that relate to our potential product candidates are controlled by our licensors. In addition, our licensors and/or licensees may have back-up rights to prosecute patent applications in the event that we do not do so or choose not to do so, and our licensees may have the right to assume patent prosecution rights after certain milestones are reached. If any of our licensing partners fail to appropriately prosecute and maintain patent protection for patents covering any of our potential product candidates, our ability to develop and commercialize those potential product candidates may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products.\nWe may be subject to litigation alleging that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties or litigation or other adversarial proceedings seeking to invalidate our patents or other proprietary rights, and we may need to resort to litigation to protect or enforce our patents or other proprietary rights, all of which will be costly to defend or pursue and uncertain in its outcome and may prevent or delay development and commercialization efforts or otherwise affect our business.\nOur success also will depend, in part, on our refraining from infringing patents or otherwise violating intellectual property owned or controlled by others. Numerous patents and pending applications are owned by third parties in the fields in which we are or may develop product candidates, both in the United States and elsewhere. It is difficult for industry participants, including us, to identify all third party patent rights that may be relevant to N91115 or any other potential product candidates because patent searching is imperfect due to differences in terminology among patents, incomplete databases and the difficulty in assessing the meaning of patent claims. Moreover, because some patent applications are maintained in secrecy until the patents publish, we cannot be certain that third parties have not filed patent applications that cover our potential product candidates and technologies. Pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, universities, research institutions and others may have filed patent applications or have received, or may obtain, issued patents in the United States or elsewhere relating to aspects of our technology, including our potential product candidates, processes for manufacture or methods of use, including combination therapy. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third party patents will require us to alter our potential product candidates or processes, obtain licenses, or cease certain activities.\nIf patents issued to third parties contain blocking, dominating or conflicting claims and such claims are ultimately determined to be valid, we may be required to obtain licenses to these patents or to develop or obtain alternative non-infringing technology and cease practicing those activities, including potentially manufacturing or selling any products deemed to infringe those patents. If any licenses are required, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such licenses on commercially favorable terms, if at all, and if these licenses are not obtained, we might be prevented from pursuing the development and commercialization of certain of our potential product candidates. Even if a license can be obtained on acceptable terms, the rights may be non-exclusive, which could give our competitors access to the same technology or intellectual property rights licensed to us. Our failure to obtain a license to any technology that we may require to commercialize our potential product candidates on favorable terms may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to, or threatened with, future litigation by third parties having patent or other intellectual property rights alleging that our technologies, including our potential product candidates, processes for manufacture or\nmethods of use, including combination therapy, or other proprietary technologies infringe their intellectual property rights. Parties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our potential product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful infringement or other intellectual property claim against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, pay royalties or redesign our affected products, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. We cannot predict whether any such license would be available at all or whether it would be available on commercially reasonable terms. Parties making successful claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our potential product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that third party patents do not exist which might be enforced against our products or potential product candidates, resulting in either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation to third parties.\nLitigation, which could result in substantial costs to us (even if determined in our favor), may also be necessary to enforce any patents issued or licensed to us. The cost to us in initiating any litigation or other proceeding relating to patent or other proprietary rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and litigation would divert our management\u2019s attention. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could delay our research and development efforts and limit our ability to continue our operations.\nIf we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our potential product candidates or our technology, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States and in most European countries, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, for example, lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability during patent litigation is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on one or more of our products or certain aspects of our platform technology. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business. Patents and other intellectual property rights also will not protect our technology if competitors design around our protected technology without legally infringing our patents or other intellectual property rights.\nIn addition, if a third party has filed patent applications in the United States prior to March 16, 2013 that claim technology also claimed by us, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention. Such proceedings can be lengthy, are costly to defend and involve complex questions of law and fact the outcomes of which are difficult to predict. Moreover, we may have to participate in adversarial proceedings in the USPTO or foreign patent offices. An adverse decision relating to our patent rights could require us to cease using such technology, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If initiated, adversarial proceedings could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us.\nIf we are not able to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information, the value of our technology and products could be significantly diminished.\nWe also rely on trade secrets to protect technology, especially where patent protection is not believed to be appropriate or obtainable or where patents have not issued. We attempt to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, with confidentiality agreements and assignment of invention agreements with our employees and confidentiality agreements with our consultants and certain contractors. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. We may fail in certain circumstances to obtain the necessary confidentiality agreements, or their scope or term may not be sufficiently broad to protect our interests.\nIf our trade secrets or other intellectual property become known to our competitors, it could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To the extent that we or our consultants or research collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in work for us, disputes may also arise as to the rights to related or resulting know-how and inventions.\nWe may be subject to claims that we or our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our employees\u2019 or consultants\u2019 former employers or their clients. These claims may be costly to defend and if we do not successfully do so, we may be required to pay monetary damages and may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key research personnel or their work product could compromise our ability to commercialize, or prevent us from commercializing, our product candidates, which could severely harm our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nRisks Relating to Our Business Operations and Industry\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain executives and to attract, retain and motivate key personnel.\nBecause of the specialized scientific nature of our business and the unique properties of our GSNOR inhibitor platform, our success is highly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and technical personnel, consultants and advisors. We are dependent on the principal members of our management staff, particularly Mr. Jon Congleton and Mr. R. Michael Carruthers, to help us achieve our business objectives. We are also dependent on the principal members of our scientific staff, particularly Ms. Janice Troha and Drs. Steven Shoemaker and Sherif Gabriel, who have extensive knowledge of, and experience developing, GSNOR inhibitors. The loss of their services might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our research, development and business objectives.\nWe will need to recruit a significant number of additional personnel in order to achieve our operating goals. In order to pursue our product development and marketing and sales plans, we will need to hire additional qualified scientific personnel to perform research and development, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical testing, government regulation, manufacturing, marketing and sales, which may strain our existing managerial, operational, regulatory compliance, financial and other resources. We also rely on consultants and advisors to assist in formulating our research and development strategy and adhering to complex regulatory requirements. We face competition for qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities and other research institutions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such individuals on acceptable terms, if at all. Additionally, our facilities are located in Colorado, which may make attracting and retaining qualified scientific and technical personnel from outside of Colorado difficult. The failure to attract and retain qualified personnel, consultants and advisors could delay or prevent our ability to commercialize our N91115 and other potential product candidate based on our GSNOR inhibitor portfolio, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will need to grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties managing this growth.\nWe are an early stage company with 29 full-time employees and two part-time employees as of March 8, 2016. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, we expect to need additional research and development, managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other resources. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including:\n\u00b7\nmanaging our clinical trials effectively;\n\u00b7\npreparing for and executing on the commercial launch of N91115 or any other potential product candidate;\n\u00b7\nidentifying, recruiting, maintaining, motivating and integrating additional employees;\n\u00b7\nmanaging our internal development efforts effectively while complying with our contractual obligations to other third parties;\n\u00b7\nimproving our managerial, development, operational and finance systems; and\n\u00b7\ndeveloping our compliance infrastructure and processes to ensure compliance with complex regulations and industry standards regarding us and our potential product candidates.\nAs our operations expand, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with various strategic partners, suppliers and other third parties. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to manage our development efforts and clinical studies and trials effectively and hire, train and integrate additional management, administrative and sales and marketing personnel. We may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could prevent us from successfully growing our company.\nWe are exposed to potential product liability or similar claims, and insurance against these claims may not be available to us at a reasonable rate in the future or at all.\nOur business exposes us to potential liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of human therapeutic products. Clinical trials involve the testing of product candidates on human subjects or volunteers under a research plan, and carry a risk of liability for personal injury or death to patients due to unforeseen adverse side effects, improper administration of the product candidate, or other factors. Many of these patients are already seriously ill and are therefore particularly vulnerable to further illness or death.\nWe currently carry clinical trial liability insurance in the amount of $10.0 million in the aggregate, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such insurance or that the amount of such insurance will be adequate to cover claims. We could be materially and adversely affected if we were required to pay damages or incur defense costs in connection with a claim outside the scope of indemnity or insurance coverage, if the indemnity is not performed or enforced in accordance with its terms, or if our liability exceeds the amount of applicable insurance. In addition, there can be no assurance that insurance will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all, or that if obtained, the insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover any potential claims or liabilities. Similar risks would exist upon the commercialization or marketing of any products by us or our collaborators.\nRegardless of their merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7\ndecreased demand for our product;\n\u00b7\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7\ncosts of litigation;\n\u00b7\ndistraction of management; and\n\u00b7\nsubstantial monetary awards to plaintiffs.\nShould any of these events occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe may become involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management\u2019s attention and adversely affect our business and could subject us to significant liabilities.\nThe stock markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the common stock of pharmaceutical companies. These broad market fluctuations as well a broad range of other factors, including the realization of any of the risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this quarterly report, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally experience significant stock price volatility. We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation often is expensive and diverts management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business. Any adverse determination in any\nsuch litigation or any amounts paid to settle any such actual or threatened litigation could require that we make significant payments.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price is likely to be volatile and an active, liquid and orderly trading market may not develop for our common stock. As a result, stockholders may not be able to resell shares at or above their purchase price.\nPrior to our initial public offering, which was completed in June 2015, there was no public market for shares of our common stock. Although our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Market, an active trading market for our common stock may not develop or, if it develops, may not be sustained. The lack of an active market may impair the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares at the time they wish to sell them or at a price that they consider reasonable, which may reduce the fair market value of their shares. Further, an inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling our common stock and may impair our ability to enter into strategic partnership or acquire future products or licenses by using our common stock as consideration.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially as a result of many factors, some of which are beyond our control. For example, shares of our common stock have traded as high as $20.43 and as low as $4.15 in the eight month period following the effective date of our IPO. These fluctuations could cause an investor to lose all or part of the value of his, her or its investment in our common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following:\n\u00b7\nthe development status of N91115 or any other potential product candidate and when they receive regulatory approval;\n\u00b7\nthe results of our preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nperformance of third parties on whom we rely to manufacture our products, product components and product candidates, including their ability to comply with regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\nthe success of, and fluctuation in, the revenue generated from our product candidates, if approved;\n\u00b7\nour execution of our sales and marketing, manufacturing and other aspects of our business plan;\n\u00b7\nresults of operations that vary from those of our competitors and the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;\n\u00b7\nour announcement of significant contracts, acquisitions, or capital commitments;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by our competitors of competing products or other initiatives;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us;\n\u00b7\nregulatory and reimbursement developments in the United States and abroad;\n\u00b7\nfuture sales of our common stock;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral domestic and international economic conditions unrelated to our performance.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance of individual companies. These broad market factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in significant liabilities and, regardless of the outcome, could result in substantial costs and the diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur principal stockholders will have a controlling influence over our business affairs and may make business decisions with which stockholders disagree and which may adversely affect the value of their investment.\nOur principal stockholders, which consist of entities affiliated with Deerfield Management Company, L.P., Wellington Management Company LLP, the Estate of Arnold H. Snider, III, and BVF Partners L.P., and certain of their affiliates, will beneficially own or control, directly or indirectly, approximately 54% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, if some of these persons or entities act together, they will have the ability to exercise significant influence over matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors, amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the approval of any business combination. These actions may be taken even if they are opposed by other stockholders. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares, which could prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares. Some of these persons or entities who make up our principal stockholders may have interests different from other stockholders.\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, of a substantial amount of our common shares could depress the trading price of our common stock.\nAs of March 8, 2016, we have 200,000,000 shares of common stock authorized and 15,462,030 shares of common stock outstanding. Of these shares, the 6,325,000 shares sold during our IPO are freely tradable and, without giving effect to the purchase of shares by entities affiliated with certain of our existing stockholders, approximately 2.8 million shares will be freely tradable pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act by non-affiliates and another approximately 6.9 million shares will be eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, subject to the volume, manner of sale, holding period and other limitations of Rule 144. If we or our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our shares of common stock in the public market or if the market perceives that these sales could occur, the market price of shares of our common stock could decline. These sales may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate, or to use equity as consideration for future acquisitions.\nThe JOBS Act will allow us to postpone the date by which we must comply with certain laws and regulations intended to protect investors and to reduce the amount of information we provide in our reports filed with the SEC. We cannot be certain if this reduced disclosure will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nThe JOBS Act is intended to reduce the regulatory burden on \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d As defined in the JOBS Act, we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and could remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until as late as December 31, 2020. For so long as we are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we will, among other things:\n\u00b7\nnot be required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley;\n\u00b7\nnot be required to hold a nonbinding advisory stockholder vote on executive compensation pursuant to Section 14A(a) of the Exchange Act;\n\u00b7\nnot be required to seek stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved pursuant to Section 14A(b) of the Exchange Act;\n\u00b7\nbe exempt from any rule adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplemental auditor discussion and analysis; and\n\u00b7\nbe subject to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements.\nWe have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of an extended transition period under the JOBS Act that permits an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. As a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other companies.\nFurthermore, if we take advantage of some or all of the reduced disclosure requirements above, investors may find our common stock less attractive, which may result in a less active trading market for our common stock and greater stock price volatility.\nAs a public reporting company, we will be subject to rules and regulations established from time to time by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, regarding our internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete needed improvements to our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the market price of our common stock and a stockholder\u2019s investment in our stock.\nAs a public reporting company, we are subject to the rules and regulations established from time to time by the SEC and the PCAOB. These rules and regulations require, among other things, that we establish and periodically evaluate procedures with respect to our internal controls over financial reporting. Reporting obligations as a public company are likely to place a considerable strain on our financial and management systems, processes and controls, as well as on our personnel.\nIn addition, as a public company we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley so that our management can certify as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting by the time our annual report for the year ending December 31, 2016 is due and thereafter, which will require us to document and make significant changes to our internal controls over financial reporting. Likewise, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at such time as we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, although, as described in the preceding risk factor, we could potentially qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until December 31, 2020. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating.\nIf our senior management is unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, or to certify the effectiveness of such controls, or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an unqualified opinion on management\u2019s assessment and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our stock price. In addition, if we do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, we may not be able to manage our business effectively or accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis, which could cause a decline in our common stock price and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures as well as internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are and will be met. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nWe will incur significantly increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance efforts.\nWe will incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses as a result of being a public company. The Dodd-Frank Act and Sarbanes-Oxley as well as related rules implemented by the SEC and The NASDAQ Global Market, have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. In addition, rules that the SEC is implementing or is required to implement pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act are expected to require additional changes. We expect that compliance with these and other similar laws, rules and regulations, including compliance when required with Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, will substantially increase our expenses, including our legal and accounting costs, and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. We also expect these laws, rules and regulations to make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage, which may make it more\ndifficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors or as officers. Although the JOBS Act may for a limited period of time somewhat lessen the cost of complying with these additional regulatory and other requirements, we nonetheless expect a substantial increase in legal, accounting, insurance and certain other expenses in the future, which will negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur corporate documents and the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, contain provisions that may enable our Board of Directors to resist a change in control of our company even if a change in control were to be considered favorable by our stockholders. These provisions:\n\u00b7\nstagger the terms of our Board of Directors and require 662/3% stockholder voting to remove directors, who may only be removed for cause;\n\u00b7\nauthorize our Board of Directors to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of those shares, which may be senior to our common stock, without prior stockholder approval;\n\u00b7\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominating directors and proposing matters to be voted on by stockholders at stockholders meetings;\n\u00b7\nprohibit our stockholders from calling a special meeting and prohibit stockholders from acting by written consent;\n\u00b7\nrequire 662/3% stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws; and\n\u00b7\nprohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates.\nThese provisions could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions our stockholders desire.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will indemnify our directors to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.\nIn addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL, our amended and restated bylaws and our indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our directors and officers provide that:\n\u00b7\nWe will indemnify our directors and officers for serving us in those capacities or for serving other business enterprises at our request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person\u2019s conduct was unlawful.\n\u00b7\nWe may, in our discretion, indemnify other employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law.\n\u00b7\nWe are required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such directors or officers shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.\n\u00b7\nWe will not be obligated pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws to indemnify any director or officer in connection with any proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless the proceeding was\nauthorized in the specific case by our Board of Directors or such indemnification is required to be made pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws.\n\u00b7\nThe rights conferred in our amended and restated bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons.\n\u00b7\nWe may not retroactively amend our amended and restated bylaw provisions to reduce our indemnification obligations to our directors or officers.\nAs a result, if we are required to indemnify one or more of our directors or officers, it may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third party claims against us, may reduce the amount of money available to us and may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or any action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to the Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein and the claim not being one which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery or for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. Any person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to this provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. This choice of forum provision may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees and agents even though an action, if successful, might benefit our stockholders. Stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware. The Court of Chancery may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe do not expect to pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently expect to retain all future earnings, if any, for future operations and expansion, and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. As a result, stockholders may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless stockholders sell our common stock for a price greater than that which they paid for it.", "PERMNO": 15432, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ALPN"}
