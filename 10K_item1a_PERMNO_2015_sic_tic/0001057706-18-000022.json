Risk Factors\nRISKS RELATING TO THE CORPORATION\u2019S BUSINESS\nUncertainty surrounding the future economic conditions that will emerge in the hurricane-impacted areas makes it difficult for management to estimate the ultimate effect of the hurricanes on credit quality, inherent loss, revenues, and asset values.\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, two hurricanes (Maria and Irma) struck the Corporation\u2019s service areas and caused significant damage to the infrastructure and property and severely disrupted normal economic activity in all of these regions. There is pervasive uncertainty surrounding the future economic conditions that will emerge in the hurricane-impacted areas. As a result, management is confronted with a significant and unfamiliar degree of uncertainty in estimating the impact of the recent hurricanes on credit quality, inherent loss, revenues, and asset values. In addition, there is uncertainty regarding the adequacy and timeliness of insurance recoveries, continued personal employment, the ability of businesses, including hotels, to reopen and the availability of goods and services to operate homes and businesses. Moreover, there is a significant level of uncertainty regarding the level of economic activity that will return to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands region over time. Some of these uncertainties include how and when rebuilding will occur, including the rebuilding of the public infrastructure, such as Puerto Rico\u2019s power grid, how and when government, private or philanthropic funds will be invested in the affected communities, how many dislocated individuals will return to the island in both the short and long term, and what other demographic changes will take place.\nDuring 2017, a separate qualitative element of the allowance for loan losses was determined to represent the estimate of inherent losses associated with the impact of the hurricane-related events on the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolios. This qualitative element of the allowance was determined based on the estimated effect that the hurricanes could have on current employment levels (e.g., an unemployment rate that significantly increases from current levels in Puerto Rico based on statistics observed in the aftermath of similar natural disasters in the U.S. mainland like Hurricane Katrina), economic activity in the Corporation\u2019s geographic regions, and the time it could take for the affected regions to return to a more normalized operating environment. For large commercial and construction loan relationships, loan officers performed individual reviews of the hurricane effect on these borrowers\u2019 sources of repayment. However, the full extent of the adverse effect on our markets and current customers from the prolonged rebuilding efforts necessary in these areas is unknown at this time. Estimates of the hurricanes\u2019 effect on loan losses could change over time as additional information becomes available, and any related revisions in the allowance calculation will be reflected in the provision for loan losses as they occur. Such revisions to these estimates could be material. As such, if these estimates prove to be incorrect, it may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Corporation provided three-month deferred repayment arrangements to consumer borrowers and holders of residential mortgage loans who were affected by the hurricanes and were current in their payments or no more than 2 payments in arrears as of the date of the hurricanes. In addition, on a case by case basis, the Corporation provided three-month deferred repayment arrangements to the holders of certain commercial and constructions loans. Although early delinquency figures show improvements after the end of the deferral period in January 2018, it is currently uncertain whether all of the borrowers that have been provided with these arrangements will be able to make payments or continue to make payments on their loans given the continuing adverse economic situation in Puerto Rico. The failure of these borrowers to make such payments may adversely affect our loan portfolio and our loan servicing portfolio delinquency levels.\nLastly, the Corporation maintains force-placed insurance policies that were put into place when a borrower\u2019s insurance policy on a property was cancelled, lapsed or was deemed insufficient and the borrower did not secure a replacement policy. A borrower may make a claim against the Corporation under such force-placed insurance policy and the failure of the Corporation to resolve such a claim to the borrower\u2019s satisfaction may result in a dispute between the borrower and the Corporation, which if not adequately resolved, could have an adverse effect on the Corporation.\nOur high level of non-performing loans may adversely affect our future results from operations.\nWe continue to have a high level of non-performing loans as of December 31, 2017, even though they decreased by $70.3 million to $497.8 million as of December 31, 2017, or 12%, from $568.2 million as of December 31, 2016. Our non-performing loans represent approximately 6% of our $8.9 billion loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017. In addition, we have a high level of total non-performing assets, even though they decreased by $83.9 million to $650.6 million as of December 31, 2017, or 11%, from $734.5 million as of December 31, 2016. The decrease in total non-performing assets was related, among other things, to the sale of the PREPA credit line with a book value of $64 million at the time of sale, and the sale of non-performing bonds of the GDB and the Puerto Rico Public Buildings Authority with an amortized cost of $23.0 million. Despite the overall decrease in non-performing assets levels for the entire year, the Corporation experienced an increase in the second half of the year, as compared to pre-hurricane levels. If we are unable to effectively maintain the quality of our loan portfolio, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nCertain funding sources may not be available to us and our funding sources may prove insufficient and/or costly to replace.\nFirstBank relies primarily on customer deposits, the issuance of brokered CDs, and advances from the FHLB of New York to maintain its lending activities and to replace certain maturing liabilities. As of December 31, 2017, we had $1.2 billion in brokered CDs outstanding, representing approximately 13% of our total deposits, and a reduction of $289.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2016. Approximately $656.9 million in brokered CDs mature over the next twelve months, and the average term to maturity of the retail brokered CDs outstanding as of December 31, 2017 was approximately 1.3 years. None of these CDs are callable at the Corporation\u2019s option.\nAlthough FirstBank has historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances, we may not be able to replace these funds in the future if our financial condition or general market conditions change. The use of brokered deposits has been particularly important for the funding of our operations. If we are unable to issue brokered deposits, or are unable to maintain access to other funding sources, our results of operations and liquidity would be adversely affected.\nAlternate sources of funding may carry higher costs than sources currently utilized. If we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources, profitability would be adversely affected. We may determine to seek debt financing in the future to achieve our long-term business objectives. Any future debt financing by the Corporation requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Reserve may not approve such financing. Additional borrowings, if sought, may not be available to us, or if available, may not be on acceptable terms. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, our credit ratings and our credit capacity. In addition, the Bank may seek to sell loans as an additional source of liquidity. If additional financing sources are unavailable or are not available on acceptable terms, our profitability and future prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on cash dividends from FirstBank to meet our cash obligations.\nAs a holding company, dividends from FirstBank have provided a substantial portion of our cash flow used to service the interest payments on our trust-preferred securities and other obligations. As stated above, we agreed to request approval from our regulators before receiving any cash dividends from FirstBank. In addition, FirstBank is limited by law in its ability to make dividend payments and other distributions to us based on its earnings and capital position. Our inability to receive approval from our regulators to receive dividends from FirstBank, or FirstBank\u2019s failure to generate sufficient cash flow to make dividend payments to us, may adversely affect our ability to meet all projected cash needs in the ordinary course of business and may have a detrimental impact on our financial condition.\nThe Banking Law of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico requires that a minimum of 10% of FirstBank\u2019s net income for the year be transferred to a legal surplus until such surplus equals the total of paid-in-capital on common and preferred stock. Amounts transferred to the legal surplus account from the retained earnings account are not available for distribution to the stockholders without the prior consent of the Puerto Rico Commissioner of Financial Institutions. The Puerto Rico Banking Law provides that, when the expenditures of a Puerto Rico commercial bank are greater than receipts, the excess of the expenditures over receipts shall be charged against the undistributed profits of the bank, and the balance, if any, shall be charged against the legal surplus reserve, as a reduction thereof. If there is no legal surplus reserve sufficient to cover such balance in whole or in part, the outstanding amount shall be charged against the capital account and the Bank cannot pay dividends until it can replenish the reserve fund to an amount of at least 20% of the original capital contributed. During 2017 and 2016, $7.3 million and $9.6 million, respectively, were transferred to the legal surplus reserve. FirstBank\u2019s legal surplus reserve amounted to $59.7 million and $52.4 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIf we do not obtain our Regulators\u2019 approval to pay interest, principal or other sums on subordinated debentures or trust-preferred securities, a default may occur.\nFollowing the termination of the Written Agreement, the Corporation agreed with the Federal Reserve to continue to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve before paying dividends, receiving dividends from FirstBank, making any distributions of interest, principal or other sums on subordinated debentures or trust-preferred securities, incurring or guaranteeing debt or purchasing or redeeming any corporate stock. Although the Corporation has received regulatory approvals that has enabled it to pay scheduled quarterly interest payments on the trust-preferred securities since the second quarter of 2016, it may not receive such approvals in the future. It is the intent of the Corporation to request approvals in future periods to continue regularly scheduled quarterly interest payments on the Corporation\u2019s outstanding subordinated debentures associated with its trust-preferred securities.\nUnder the subordinated debentures\u2019 indentures, we have the right, from time to time, and without causing an event of default, to defer payments of interest on the subordinated debentures by extending the interest payment period at any time and from time to time during the term of the subordinated debentures for up to twenty consecutive quarterly periods. We may need to elect extension periods for future quarterly interest payments if the Federal Reserve advises us that it will not approve such future quarterly interest payments or if we do not receive the approval from our regulators before receiving any cash dividends from FirstBank given that, as mentioned above, dividends from FirstBank have provided a substantial portion of our cash flow used to service the interest payments on our outstanding subordinated debentures. Our inability to receive approval from the Federal Reserve to make distributions of interest, principal or other sums on our trust-preferred securities and subordinated debentures or to receive a cash dividend from FirstBank could result in a default under those obligations if we need to defer such payments for longer than twenty consecutive quarterly periods.\nCredit quality may result in additional losses.\nThe quality of our loans has continued to be under pressure as a result of continued recessionary conditions in the markets we serve that have led to, among other things, high unemployment levels, low absorption rates for new residential construction projects and further declines in property values. Our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties and the value of the assets securing our loans or underlying our investments. When the credit quality of the customer base materially decreases or the risk profile of a market, industry or group of customers changes materially, our business, financial condition, allowance levels, asset impairments, liquidity, capital and results of operations are adversely affected.\nWe have a commercial and construction loan portfolio held for investment in the amount of $3.8 billion as of December 31, 2017. Due to their nature, these loans entail a higher credit risk than consumer and residential mortgage loans, since they are larger in size, concentrate more risk in a single borrower and are generally more sensitive to economic downturns. Furthermore, given the slowdown in the real estate market, the properties securing these loans may be difficult to dispose of if they are foreclosed. As of December 31, 2017, we had $294.4 million in non-performing commercial and construction loans held for investment. During 2017, the Corporation established a $68.5 million storm-related allowance for loan losses related to the estimate of inherent losses resulting from the effect of Hurricane Irma and Maria, including a $28.9 million storm-related allowance for commercial and construction loans. We may incur additional losses over the near term, either because of continued deterioration of the quality of the loans or because of sales of troubled loans, which would likely accelerate the recognition of losses. Any such losses would adversely impact our overall financial performance and results of operations.\nOur allowance for loan and lease losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and we may be required to materially increase our allowance, which may adversely affect our capital, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the risk of loss from loan defaults and foreclosures with respect to the loans we originate and purchase. We establish a provision for loan and lease losses, which leads to reductions in our income from operations, in order to maintain our allowance for inherent loan and lease losses at a level that our management deems to be appropriate based upon an assessment of the quality of the loan and lease portfolio. Management may fail to accurately estimate the level of inherent loan and lease losses or may have to increase our provision for loan and lease losses in the future as a result of new information regarding existing loans, future increases in non-performing loans, changes in economic and other conditions affecting borrowers or for other reasons beyond our control. In addition, the bank regulatory agencies periodically review the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses or the recognition of additional classified loans and loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management.\nThe level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s estimates based upon various assumptions and judgments as to specific credit risks, evaluation of industry concentrations, loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, present economic, political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires management to make significant estimates and judgments regarding current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. If our estimates prove to be incorrect, our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover losses in our loan portfolio and our expense relating to the additional provision for credit losses could increase substantially.\nAny such increases in our provision for loan and lease losses or any loan losses in excess of our provision for loan and lease losses would have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations. Given the difficulties facing some of our largest borrowers, these borrowers may fail to continue to repay their loans on a timely basis or we may not be able to assess accurately any risk of loss from the loans to these borrowers. See our risk factor \u201cUncertainty surrounding the future economic conditions that will emerge in the hurricane-impacted areas makes it difficult for management to estimate the ultimate effect of the hurricanes on credit quality, inherent loss, revenues and asset values\u201d above for additional information about uncertainties surrounding the ultimate effect of the hurricanes on the affected regions.\nChanges in collateral values of properties located in stagnant or distressed economies may require increased reserves.\nFurther deterioration of the value of real estate collateral securing our construction, commercial and residential mortgage loan portfolios would result in increased credit losses. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 1%, 18% and 37% of our loan portfolio consisted of construction, commercial mortgage and residential real estate loans, respectively.\nA substantial part of our loan portfolio is located within the boundaries of the U.S. economy. Whether the collateral is located in Puerto Rico, the USVI, the BVI, or the U.S. mainland, the performance of our loan portfolio and the collateral value backing the transactions are dependent upon the performance of and conditions within each specific real estate market. Puerto Rico has been in an economic recession since 2006. Sustained weak economic conditions that have affected Puerto Rico over the last several years have resulted in declines in collateral values.\nConstruction and commercial loans, mostly secured by commercial and residential real estate properties, entail a higher credit risk than consumer and residential mortgage loans since they are larger in size, may have less collateral coverage, concentrate more risk in a single borrower and are generally more sensitive to economic downturns. As of December 31, 2017, commercial mortgage and construction real estate loans amounted to $1.7 billion or 20% of the total loan portfolio.\nWe measure the impairment of a loan based on the fair value of the collateral, if collateral dependent, which is generally obtained from appraisals. Updated appraisals are obtained when we determine that loans are impaired and are updated annually thereafter. In addition, appraisals are also obtained for certain residential mortgage loans on a spot basis based on specific characteristics such as delinquency levels, age of the appraisal and loan-to-value ratios. The appraised value of the collateral may decrease or we may not be able to recover collateral at its appraised value. A significant decline in collateral valuations for collateral dependent loans may require increases in our specific provision for loan losses and an increase in the general valuation allowance. Any such increase would have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2017, net charge-offs on construction, commercial mortgage and residential mortgage loan portfolios totaled $2.9 million, $38.8 million and $25.7 million, respectively.\nInterest rate shifts may reduce net interest income.\nShifts in short-term interest rates may reduce net interest income, which is the principal component of our earnings. Net interest income is the difference between the amounts received by us on our interest-earning assets and the interest paid by us on our interest-bearing liabilities. Differences in the re-pricing structure of our assets and liabilities may result in changes in our profits when interest rates change.\nIncreases in interest rates may reduce demand for mortgage and other loans.\nHigher interest rates increase the cost of mortgage and other loans to consumers and businesses and may reduce demand for such loans, which may negatively impact our profits by reducing the amount of loan interest income.\nAccelerated prepayments may adversely affect net interest income.\nIn general, fixed-income portfolio yields would decrease if the re-investment of pre-payment amounts is at lower rates. Net interest income could also be affected by prepayments of mortgage-backed securities. Acceleration in the prepayments of mortgage-backed securities would lower yields on these securities, as the amortization of premiums paid upon the acquisition of these securities would accelerate. Conversely, acceleration in the prepayments of mortgage-backed securities would increase yields on securities purchased at a discount, as the accretion of the discount would accelerate. These risks are directly linked to future period market interest rate fluctuations. Also, net interest income in future periods might be affected by our investment in callable securities because decreases in interest rates might prompt the early redemption of such securities.\nChanges in interest rates on loans and borrowings may adversely affect net interest income.\nBasis risk is the risk of adverse consequences resulting from unequal changes in the difference, also referred to as the \u201cspread\u201d or basis, between the rates for two or more different instruments with the same maturity and occurs when market rates for different financial instruments or the indices used to price assets and liabilities change at different times or by different amounts. For example, the interest expense for liability instruments such as brokered CDs might not change by the same amount as interest income received from loans or investments. To the extent that the interest rates on loans and borrowings change at different rates and by different amounts, the margin between our LIBOR-based assets and the higher cost of the brokered CDs might be compressed and adversely affect net interest income.\nIf all or a significant portion of the unrealized losses in our investment securities portfolio on our consolidated statement of financial condition is determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired, we would recognize a material charge to our earnings and our capital ratios would be adversely affected.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, we recognized a total of $16.5 million, $6.7 million and $12.2 million, respectively, in other-than-temporary impairments. These impairments were primarily related to three Puerto Rico government debt securities which were sold during 2017. To the extent that any portion of the unrealized losses in our investment securities portfolio of $43.8 million as of December 31, 2017 is determined to be other-than-temporary and, in the case of debt securities, the loss is related to credit factors, we would recognize a charge to earnings in the quarter during which such determination is made and capital ratios could be adversely affected. Even if we do not determine that the unrealized losses associated with this portfolio require an impairment charge, increases in unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities adversely affect our tangible common equity ratio, which may adversely affect credit rating agency and investor sentiment towards us. Any negative perception also may adversely affect our ability to access the capital or credit markets or might increase our cost of capital. Valuation and other-than-temporary impairment determinations will continue to be affected by external market factors including default rates, severity rates and macro-economic factors.\nDowngrades in our credit ratings could further increase the cost of borrowing funds.\nThe Corporation\u2019s ability to access new non-deposit sources of funding, even if approved by the Federal Reserve, could be adversely affected by downgrades in our credit ratings. The Corporation\u2019s liquidity is to a certain extent contingent upon its ability to obtain external sources of funding to finance its operations. The Corporation\u2019s current credit ratings and any downgrades in such credit ratings can hinder the Corporation\u2019s access to new forms of external funding and/or cause external funding to be more expensive, which could in turn adversely affect results of operations.\nDefective and repurchased loans may harm our business and financial condition.\nIn connection with the sale and securitization of loans, we are required to make a variety of customary representations and warranties relating to the loans sold or securitized. Our obligations with respect to these representations and warranties are generally outstanding for the life of the loan, and relate to, among other things:\n\u00b7 compliance with laws and regulations;\n\u00b7 underwriting standards;\n\u00b7 the accuracy of information in the loan documents and loan files; and\n\u00b7 the characteristics and enforceability of the loan\nA loan that does not comply with these representations and warranties may take longer to sell, may impact our ability to obtain third-party financing for the loan, and may not be saleable or may be saleable only at a significant discount. If such a loan is sold before we detect non-compliance, we may be obligated to repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly, or we may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any loss, either of which could reduce our cash available for operations and liquidity. Management believes that it has established controls to ensure that loans are originated in accordance with the secondary market\u2019s requirements, but mistakes may be made, or certain employees may deliberately violate our lending policies.\nWe are subject to certain regulatory restrictions that may adversely affect our operations.\nWe are subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board. We are a bank holding company and a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended.\nFinancial holding companies are permitted to engage in a broader range of \u201cfinancial\u201d activities than those permitted to bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies. A financial holding company that ceases to meet certain standards is subject to a variety of restrictions, depending on the circumstances, including precluding the undertaking of new activities or the acquisition of shares or control of other companies. The Corporation currently is restricted in its ability to engage in new financial activities or the acquisition of shares or control of other companies without the prior written approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\nOn October 3, 2017, the Federal Reserve terminated the Written Agreement entered to on June 3, 2010 between the Corporation and the Federal Reserve.\nAlthough the Written Agreement is now terminated, the Corporation has agreed with its regulators to continue to obtain approval before paying dividends, receiving dividends from the Bank, making payments on subordinated debt or trust preferred securities, incurring or guaranteeing debt or purchasing or redeeming any corporate stock. If we fail to comply with the requirements from our regulators, we may become subject to regulatory enforcement action and other adverse regulatory actions that might have a material and adverse effect on our operations.\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, our risk management policies and procedures may be inadequate and operational risks could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.\nWe may fail to identify and manage risks related to a variety of aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, operational risk, interest-rate risk, trading risk, fiduciary risk, legal and compliance risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. We have adopted and periodically improved various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risk. Any improvements to our controls, procedures, policies and systems, however, may not be adequate to identify and manage the risks in our various businesses. If our risk framework is ineffective, either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets or our businesses or for other reasons, we could incur losses or suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory mandates or expectations.\nWe may also be subject to disruptions from external events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which could cause delays or disruptions to operational functions, including information processing and financial market settlement functions. In addition, our customers, vendors and counterparties could suffer from such events. Should these events affect us, or the customers, vendors or counterparties with which we conduct business, our consolidated results of operations could be negatively affected. When we record balance sheet reserves for probable loss contingencies related to operational losses, we may be unable to accurately estimate our potential exposure, and any reserves we establish to cover operational losses may not be sufficient to cover our actual financial exposure, which may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition for the periods in which we recognize the losses.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures could adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations accurately and on a timely basis.\nIn connection with our fiscal 2017 assessment of internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to the estimation procedures for the allowance for loan losses for commercial loans. For a discussion of our internal control over financial reporting and a description of the identified material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, see the \u201cManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\u201d set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As of December 31, 2017, a control deficiency existed with respect to management\u2019s review and approval of the appropriateness of certain assumptions used to estimate the allowance for loan losses for commercial loans. Specifically, management\u2019s estimate did not incorporate the actual historical loss rate for loans classified substandard in the commercial loan portfolio, that instead was determined based on a blended loss rate using aggregate historical charge-offs and portfolio balance data for loans rated as special mention, substandard, and doubtful. Although this control deficiency did not result in an adjustment to the annual financial statements as of December 31, 2017, if we are unable to remediate the identified control deficiency, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, could be adversely affected. The occurrence of or failure to remediate the material weakness may adversely affect our reputation and business and the market price of our common stock and any other securities we may issue.\nCyber-attacks, system risks and data protection breaches could present significant reputational, legal and regulatory costs.\nThe Corporation is under continuous threat of cyber-attacks especially as we continue to expand customer services via the internet and other remote service channels. Three of the most significant cyber-attack risks that we face are e-fraud, denial-of-service and computer intrusion that might result in loss of sensitive customer data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals breach and extract funds from customer bank accounts. Denial-of-service disrupts services available to our customers through our on-line banking system. Computer intrusion attempts might result in the breach of sensitive customer data, such as account numbers and social security numbers, and any cyber-attacks could present significant reputational, legal and/or regulatory costs to the Corporation if successful. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature and complexity of the threats from organized cybercriminals and hackers, and our plans to continue to provide electronic banking services to our customers.\nIf personal, non-public, confidential or proprietary information of our customers in our possession were to be mishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, the erroneous provision of information to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, or the interception or other inappropriate use of such information by third parties.\nWe rely on other companies to perform key aspects of our business infrastructure.\nThird parties perform key aspects of our business operations such as data processing, information security, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, internet connections and network access. While we believe that we have selected these third-party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason, the provision by a vendor of poor performance of services, or failure of a vendor to notify us of a reportable event, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third-party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor\u2019s ability to serve us. Replacing these third-party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an inherent risk to our business operations.\nCompetition for our executives and other key employees is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most activities in which we engage can be intense, and we may not be able to hire people or retain them, particularly in light of uncertainty concerning compensation restrictions applicable to banks but not applicable to other financial services firms. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could adversely affect our business because of the loss of their skills, knowledge of our markets and years of industry experience and, in some cases, because of the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement employees. Similarly, the loss of our executives or other key employees, either individually or as a group, could result in a loss of customer confidence in our ability to execute banking transactions on their behalf.\nOur compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve Board. We also may be subject to limitations on compensation practices by the FDIC or other regulators, which may or may not affect our competitors. Limitations on our compensation practices could have a negative impact on our ability to attract and retain talented senior leaders in support of our long term strategy.\nOur compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC. Any deficiencies in our compensation practices may be incorporated into our supervisory ratings, which can affect our ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. In addition, the regulation of our compensation practices may change in the future.\nOur compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC. As discussed above, the Corporation currently is subject to the 2010 interagency guidance governing the incentive compensation activities of regulated banks and bank holding companies. Our failure to satisfy these restrictions and guidelines could expose us to adverse regulatory criticism, lowered supervisory ratings, and restrictions on our operations and acquisition activities. In addition, the federal banking agencies have proposed new regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act that place restrictions on the incentive compensation practices of banking organizations with $1 billion or more in assets.\nThe scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators\u2019 policies on executive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the near future. It cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect the ability of the Corporation and its subsidiaries to hire, retain and motivate their key employees.\nFurther increases in the FDIC deposit insurance premium or in FDIC required reserves may have a significant financial impact on us.\nThe FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured depository institutions up to certain limits (currently, $250,000 per depositor account). The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund (the \u201cDIF\u201d). In the event of a bank failure, the FDIC takes control of a failed bank and, if necessary, pays all insured deposits up to the statutory deposit insurance limits using the resources of the DIF. The FDIC is required by law to maintain adequate funding of the DIF, and the FDIC may increase premium assessments to maintain such funding.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to increase the DIF\u2019s reserves against future losses, which will require institutions with assets greater than $10 billion, such as FirstBank, to bear an increased responsibility for funding the prescribed reserve to support the DIF. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to bolster the DIF by increasing the required reserve ratio for the industry to 1.35 percent (the ratio of reserves to insured deposits) by September 30, 2020.\nThe FDIC\u2019s revised rule on deposit insurance assessments implements a provision in the Dodd-Frank Act that changes the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums from one based on domestic deposits to one based on average consolidated total assets minus average Tier 1 capital. The rule changes the assessment rate schedules for insured depository institutions so that approximately the same amount of revenue would be collected under the new assessment base as would be collected under the previous rate schedule and the schedules previously proposed by the FDIC. The rule also revises the risk-based assessment system for\nall large insured depository institutions (generally, institutions with at least $10 billion in total assets, such as FirstBank). Under the rule, the FDIC uses a scorecard method to calculate assessment rates for all such institutions.\nIn March 2016, the FDIC adopted a final rule imposing a quarterly deposit insurance assessment surcharge on banks with at least $10 billion in assets of 4.5 cents per $100 of their assessment base, after making certain adjustments once the Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio reaches or exceeds 1.15 percent. For purposes of this surcharge, the first $10 billion of assets are subtracted from the regular insurance assessment base to determine the surcharge base. The assessment surcharge became effective on July 1, 2016 and applies to FirstBank. In addition, under the Final Rule, if the Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio does not reach 1.35 percent by December 31, 2018, a shortfall assessment may be assessed on large banks in the first quarter of 2019 and collected by the FDIC on June 30, 2019. The FDIC also adopted a final rule raising its industry target ratio of reserves to insured deposits to 2 percent, 65 basis points above the statutory minimum, but the FDIC does not project that goal to be met for several years.\nThe FDIC may further increase FirstBank\u2019s premiums or impose additional assessments or prepayment requirements in the future. The Dodd-Frank Act has removed the statutory cap for the reserve ratio, leaving the FDIC free to set this cap going forward.\nOur businesses may be adversely affected by litigation.\nFrom time to time, our customers, or the government on their behalf, may make claims and take legal action relating to our performance of fiduciary or contractual responsibilities. We may also face employment lawsuits or other legal claims. In any such claims or actions, demands for substantial monetary damages may be asserted against us, resulting in financial liability or an adverse effect on our reputation among investors or on customer demand for our products and services. We may be unable to accurately estimate our exposure to litigation risk when we record balance sheet reserves for probable loss contingencies. As a result, reserves we establish to cover any settlements or judgments may not be sufficient to cover our actual financial exposure, which has occurred in the past and may again occur, resulting in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we are also subject to various regulatory, governmental and law enforcement inquiries, investigations and subpoenas. These may be directed generally to participants in the businesses in which we are involved or may be specifically directed at us. In regulatory enforcement matters, claims for disgorgement, the imposition of penalties and the imposition of other remedial sanctions are possible.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs, potential liabilities and the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nThe resolution of legal actions or regulatory matters, when unfavorable, has had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for the quarter in which such actions or matters are resolved or a reserve is established.\nOur businesses may be negatively affected by adverse publicity or other reputational harm.\nOur relationships with many of our customers are predicated upon our reputation as a fiduciary and a service provider that adheres to the highest standards of ethics, service quality and regulatory compliance. Adverse publicity, regulatory actions, litigation, operational failures, the failure to meet customer expectations and other issues with respect to one or more of our businesses could materially and adversely affect our reputation, or our ability to attract and retain customers or obtain sources of funding for the same or other businesses. Preserving and enhancing our reputation also depends on maintaining systems and procedures that address known risks and regulatory requirements, as well as our ability to identify and mitigate additional risks that arise due to changes in our businesses, the market places in which we operate, the regulatory environment and customer expectations. If we fail to promptly address matters that bear on our reputation, our reputation may be materially adversely affected and our business may suffer.\nChanges in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board may adversely affect our financial statements.\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), which are periodically revised and expanded. Accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d). The FASB has issued several financial accounting and reporting standards that will govern key aspects of the Corporation\u2019s financial statements or interpretations thereof when those standards become effective, including those areas where the Corporation is required to make assumptions or estimates. For example, the FASB\u2019s new accounting standard on credit losses, which will become effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2020, will require earlier recognition of credit losses on financial assets. The new accounting model requires that lifetime \u201cexpected credit losses\u201d of financial assets not recorded at fair value through net income, such as loans and held-to-maturity securities, be recorded at inception of the financial asset, replacing the multiple existing impairment models under GAAP which generally require that a loss be \u201cincurred\u201d before it is recognized. For additional information on this and other accounting standards, see Note 1, \u201cNature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nChanges to financial accounting or reporting standards or interpretations, whether promulgated or required by the FASB or other regulators, could present operational challenges and could require the Corporation to change certain of the assumptions or estimates it previously used in preparing its financial statements, which could negatively impact how it records and reports its financial condition and results of operations generally and/or with respect to particular businesses. For additional information on the key areas for which assumption and estimates are used in preparing the Corporation\u2019s financial statements, see Note 1, \u201cNature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAny impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may adversely affect our operating results.\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. Under GAAP, we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of the goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in the industry.\nThe goodwill impairment evaluation process requires us to make estimates and assumptions with regards to the fair value of our reporting units. Actual values may differ significantly from these estimates. Such differences could result in future impairment of goodwill that would, in turn, negatively impact our results of operations and the reporting unit where the goodwill is recorded. We conducted our most recent evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nIf we are required to record a charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements because an impairment of the goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRecognition of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income by the Bank.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Corporation had a deferred tax asset of $294.8 million (net of a valuation allowance of $191.2 million), including $173.2 million associated with FirstBank\u2019s Net Operating Losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d). Under Puerto Rico law, the Corporation and its subsidiaries, including FirstBank, are treated as separate taxable entities and are not entitled to file consolidated tax returns. Accordingly, in order to obtain a tax benefit from NOLs, a particular subsidiary must be able to demonstrate sufficient taxable income. Nonetheless, the 2011 PR Code allows entities organized as limited liability companies to perform an election to become a non-taxable \u201cpass-through\u201d entity and utilize losses to offset income from other \u201cpass-through\u201d entities, subject to certain limitations, with the remaining net income passing-through to its partner entities. To obtain the full benefit of the applicable deferred tax asset attributable to NOLs, FirstBank and its pass-through entities must have sufficient taxable income within the applicable carry forward period (7 years for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2005, 12 years for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2004 and before January 1, 2013, and 10 years for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012). The Bank incurred all of its NOLs on or after 2009. Accounting for income taxes requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be recorded against their deferred tax asset based on an assessment of the amount of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be realized.\nThe Corporation has a partial valuation allowance over its deferred tax assets in the amount of $191.2 million as of December 31, 2017. Due to significant estimates utilized in determining the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that, in the future, the Corporation will not be able to reverse the valuation allowance or that the Corporation will need to increase its current deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\nThe Corporation\u2019s judgments regarding tax accounting policies and the resolution of tax disputes may impact the Corporation\u2019s earnings and cash flow.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the Corporation\u2019s effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions. The Corporation provides for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement criteria prescribed by applicable GAAP.\nFluctuations in federal, state, local and foreign taxes or a change to uncertain tax positions, including related interest and penalties, may impact the Corporation\u2019s effective tax rate. When particular tax matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved. In addition, tax positions may be challenged by the Puerto Rico Department of Treasury (\u201cPRTD\u201d), the United States Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate and we may estimate and provide for potential liabilities that may arise out of tax audits to the extent that uncertain tax positions fail to meet the recognition standard under applicable GAAP. Unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate and could result in a material increase in our tax expense. Resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.\nChanges in the Tax Law in multiple jurisdictions can materially affect our operations, tax obligations and effective tax rate.\nFirst BanCorp. is subject to Puerto Rico income tax on its income from all sources. As a Puerto Rico corporation, it is treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. and USVI income tax purposes and is generally subject to U.S. and USVI income tax only on its income from sources within the U.S. and USVI or income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in those regions. The USVI jurisdiction imposes income taxes based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code under the \u201cmirror system\u201d established by the Naval Service Appropriations Act of 1922. However, the USVI jurisdiction also imposes an additional 10% surtax on the USVI tax liability, if any.\nThese tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and our valuation allowance. In addition, legislative changes, particularly changes in tax laws, could adversely impact our results of operations.\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States president signed H.R.1, approved by Congress, including an overhaul of individual, business and international taxes, which impacts corporations doing business in the U.S. and the USVI. The US Tax Reform requires new computations to be performed that were not previously required in U.S. tax law and judgment is required in the interpretation of the provisions of the US Tax Reform. Some international provisions of the US Tax Reform, such as the GILTI tax, could also result in the relocation of U.S. Controlled Foreign Corporations (\u201cCFC\u201d) doing business in Puerto Rico which could have a significant impact on the economy of Puerto Rico and consequently on the operations of the Corporation. Also, the US Tax Reform could trigger changes in tax law or increase taxes in the USVI jurisdiction in order to offset the effects of the reduction in income tax rate in the USVI.\nOn January 24, 2018 the Government of Puerto Rico announced that it is developing a Puerto Rico Tax Reform, which would reduce corporate tax rates, to increase competitiveness of the Island after the enactment of the US Tax Reform. However, such plan is subject to approval from the PROMESA oversight board and subsequent legislative action.\nChanges in Puerto Rico, U.S. or other jurisdiction\u2019s applicable tax laws or tax authorities\u2019 new interpretations, could result in increases in our overall taxes and the Corporation\u2019s financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards may be limited.\nThe Corporation has Puerto Rico, U.S. and USVI sourced NOL\u2019s carryforwards. Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (\u201cSection 382\u201d) and Section 1034.04(u) of the Puerto Rico Internal revenue Code (\u201cSection 1034.04(u)\u201d), which is significantly similar to Section 382, limit the ability to utilize U.S., USVI and Puerto Rico NOLs, respectively, at such jurisdictions following an event of an ownership change. Generally, an ownership change occurs when certain shareholders increase their aggregate ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage over a three-year testing period. However, Puerto Rico Section 1034.04(u) has a particular exemption (\u201cthe Capital Raise Exemption\u201d), which allows a change in control to be exempt from Section 1034.04(u) if the purpose of the issuance is to raise capital for the operations of the entity, and immediately after the issuance, and for no less than five years, the entity\u2019s shares are marketed in one or more recognized stock exchanges. Upon the occurrence of a Section 382 or Section 1034.04(u) ownership change, the use of NOLs attributable to the period prior to the ownership change is subject to limitations and only a portion of the U.S., USVI and Puerto Rico NOLs, as applicable, may be used by the Corporation to offset the annual U.S., USVI and Puerto Rico taxable income, if any. During 2017, the Corporation completed a formal ownership change analysis within the meaning of Section 382 covering a comprehensive period, and concluded that an ownership change, for U.S. and USVI purposes only, occurred during the period evaluated. The Section 382 limitation resulted in higher U.S. liabilities than we would have incurred in the absence of such limitation.\nFurthermore, it is possible that the utilization of our Puerto Rico, U.S. and USVI NOLs could be further limited due to future changes in our stock ownership, as a result of either sales of our outstanding shares or issuances of new shares that could separately or cumulatively trigger an ownership change and, consequently, a Section 1034.04(u) or Section 382 limitation. Any Section 1034.04(u) limitation for Puerto Rico could result in material adjustments to our deferred tax assets, earnings and cash flows. Any further Section 382 limitations may result in greater U.S. and USVI tax liabilities than we would incur in the absence of such a limitation and any increased liabilities could adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. We may be able to mitigate the adverse effects associated with a Section 382 limitation in the U.S. and USVI to the extent that we could credit any resulting additional U.S. and USVI tax liability against our tax liability in Puerto Rico. However, our ability to credit U.S. and USVI taxes against Puerto Rico taxes is subject to limitations and will depend on our tax profile and other factors at each annual taxable period.\nWe must respond to rapid technological changes, and these changes may be more difficult or expensive than anticipated.\nIf competitors introduce new products and services embodying new technologies, or if new industry standards and practices emerge, our existing product and service offerings, technology and systems may become obsolete. Further, if we fail to adopt or develop new technologies or to adapt our products and services to emerging industry standards, we may lose current and future customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The financial services industry is changing rapidly and, in order to remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our products, services and technologies. These changes may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND OUR INDUSTRY\nContinuation of the economic slowdown and decline in the real estate market in Puerto Rico could continue to harm our results of operations.\nThe residential mortgage loan origination business has historically been cyclical, enjoying periods of strong growth and profitability followed by periods of shrinking volumes and industry-wide losses. The market for residential mortgage loan originations has declined over the past few years and this trend may continue to reduce the level of mortgage loans we produce in the future and adversely affect our business. During periods of rising interest rates, the refinancing of many mortgage products tends to decrease as the economic incentives for borrowers to refinance their existing mortgage loans are reduced. In addition, the residential mortgage loan origination business is impacted by home values.\nThe actual rates of delinquencies, foreclosures and losses on loans have been higher during the economic slowdown. Rising unemployment, volatile interest rates and declines in housing prices have had a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to repay their mortgage loans. Any sustained period of increased delinquencies, foreclosures or losses could continue to adversely affect our ability to sell loans, the prices we receive for loans, the values of mortgage loans held for sale or residual interests in securitizations, which could continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any additional material decline in real estate values would further weaken the collateral loan-to-value ratios and increase the possibility of loss if a borrower defaults. In such event, we will be subject to the risk of loss on such real estate arising from borrower defaults to the extent not covered by third-party credit enhancement.\nThe Corporation\u2019s credit quality and the value of our portfolio of Puerto Rico government securities has been and in the future may be adversely affected by Puerto Rico\u2019s economic condition, and may be affected by actions taken by the Puerto Rico government or the PROMESA oversight board to address the ongoing fiscal and economic challenges in Puerto Rico.\nA significant portion of our financial activities and credit exposure is concentrated in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, which has been in an economic recession since 2006, exacerbated by the effect of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017. Based on the most recent information available included in the Revised Fiscal Plan submitted by the Puerto Rico government for the review of the PROMESA oversight board, Puerto Rico\u2019s GNP has shrunk by more than 14% since 2006. For fiscal year 2018, the Puerto Rico government projects a contraction in the Puerto Rico\u2019s GNP of 11.0%, followed by projected growths of 8.4% and 3.5% for fiscal years 2019 and 2020, respectively, based on an assumption of Puerto Rico\u2019s receipt of $49.1 billion of Federal Disaster Relief assistance and $21 billion from private insurance funds. Meanwhile, the GDB-EAI in December 2017 was 104.9, a 14.0% reduction compared to December 2016, and a decrease of 13.3% compared to August 2017. The GDB-EAI is a coincident index of economic activity for Puerto Rico made up of four indicators (non-farm payroll employment, electric power generation, cement sales and gasoline consumption). The Revised Fiscal Plan states that the hurricanes will create a spike in inflation of 2.1% in fiscal year 2018, with subsequent average increases of about 1.5% over the next six years, until fiscal year 2023.\nThe seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in Puerto Rico was 10.9% in December 2017, compared to 12.4% in December 2016. However, the Puerto Rico labor force participation rate was 40.9% as of December 2017. The average of the labor force participation rate in Puerto Rico was 45.05% from 1990 until 2017, reaching an all-time high of 49.80% percent in February of 2007 and a record low of 38.6% in October of 2017. Based on information published by the Puerto Rico government, the labor force estimate was 1.1 million people for December 2017, a reduction of 1.6% when compared with December 2016. The Revised Fiscal Plan reflects that a 20% cumulative decline in population is expected over the next six years.\nBased on information published by the Puerto Rico Treasury, the net revenues of the Puerto Rico government\u2019s General Fund in December 2017 totaled $697.6 million, which was $101.9 million less than in December 2016. The net revenues to the General Fund for the first half of fiscal year ending June 30, 2018 totaled $3,623.1 million, a decrease of $348.0 million, or 8.8%, compared with the previous fiscal year, and, $157.3 million, or 4.3%, below initial estimates for this period. The Revised Fiscal Plan reflects a projected decline in revenues of 19.8% in fiscal year 2018 before increasing 10.2% in fiscal year 2019 and 5.1% in fiscal year 2020. As per the Revised Fiscal Plan, revenues are forecasted to become 3% higher than pre-hurricane levels by fiscal year 2023, in nominal terms.\nPrices on most Commonwealth of Puerto Rico securities have decreased over the past months. General obligations with an eight percent coupon and maturing in 2035 traded in January at an average of 25 cents on the dollar, down from as much as 59 cents in September, before the hurricane.\nOn May 3, 2017, the Puerto Rico government and the PROMESA oversight board filed for a form of bankruptcy in the U.S. District court in Puerto Rico under Title III of PROMESA. The Title III provision allows for a court debt restructuring process similar to U.S. bankruptcy protection. On July 2, 2017, the PROMESA oversight board filed for a similar Title III form of bankruptcy in the U.S. District court in Puerto Rico for PREPA.\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, Hurricanes Irma and Maria affected Puerto Rico causing significant damage to the infrastructure and property. In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, the NOAA stated that damages could totalize $90 billion. The emergency could cause Puerto Rico\u2019s central government and some of its instrumentalities to face severe cash shortfalls from lower revenues, higher cost, and delayed or reduced cost-saving measures that had been required by the fiscal plans previously approved early in 2017.\nThe Puerto Rico government and the PROMESA oversight board requested federal assistance from the United States government. Such assistance is intended to provide Puerto Rico with the cash that it will need to operate its core government services and its disaster response effort in the near future. On December 18, 2017, the U.S. House of Representative introduced a bill to provide additional emergency assistance for the recent hurricanes, wildfires in California, and related agriculture losses. The bill totals $81 billion and targets funds to programs to continue relief and recovery efforts in all of the affected communities, including Texas, Florida, California, Louisiana, Puerto Rico and the USVI.\nOn February 9, 2018, the Puerto Rico Governor and the Resident Commissioner announced an allocation of $16 billion in federal funds for the island\u2019s recovery after Hurricane Maria. This appropriation is part of budget legislation approved by the U.S. Congress and signed by the President of the United States on February 9, 2018. Approximately $11.0 billion of the $16.0 billion was allocated to the community development fund, known as the Community Development Block Grant, to repair homes, support local businesses and rebuild infrastructure while mitigating future risks. From this figure, $2.0 billion will be designated to restore and make improvements to the electrical system. In addition, $1.37 billion was approved for emergency assistance and $150 million under the Direct Loan Program to cover cost sharing with FEMA. In addition to the $16.0 billion, Puerto Rico is also eligible to participate in other programs that could increase aid to the island to more than $45 billion.\nOn February 12, 2018, the FAFAA released the Revised Fiscal Plan for the Commonwealth, after considering the changes and clarifications required by the PROMESA oversight board to a previous draft. The Fiscal Plan includes substantial revisions that the Puerto Rico government has made to the previous fiscal plan, certified on March 13, 2017, to account for the effect of Hurricanes Maria and Irma and to account for a contemplated transformational transaction. The Revised Fiscal Plan uses a six-year horizon, projects a six-year cumulative decline in population of 20%, and projects that by the fiscal year 2023 there will be a $3.4 billion surplus, before any debt service is paid, requiring a liquidity facility to provide public services in fiscal year 2018. The March 2017 fiscal plan covered a 10-year period and allocated around $787 million per year for debt service. The Revised Fiscal Plan also includes projected expenses for Title III proceedings, considers an injection of $49 billion in federal relief assistance, and a series of structural reforms in, among others things, the areas of ease of doing business, human capital, tax reform, and power sector reform, including a layout for the privatization of PREPA. The Revised Fiscal Plan also creates an annual reserve of $130 million and a $400 million investment for infrastructure maintenance and development. The PROMESA oversight board is expected to evaluate the plan in the coming weeks and, after a public hearing, determine whether to certify it.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Corporation had $214.5 million of direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government, its municipalities and public corporations, compared to $323.3 million as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, approximately $184.6 million of the exposure consisted of loans and obligations of municipalities in Puerto Rico that are supported by assigned property tax revenues and for which, in most cases, the good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power of the applicable municipality have been pledged to their repayment. These municipalities are required by law to levy special property taxes in such amounts as are required for the payment of all of their respective general obligation bonds and loans. The PROMESA oversight board has not designated any of Puerto Rico\u2019s 78 municipalities as covered entities under PROMESA. However, while the Revised Fiscal Plan did not contemplate a restructuring of the debt of Puerto Rico\u2019s municipalities, the plan did call for the gradual elimination of budgetary subsidies provided to municipalities by the central government. Furthermore, municipalities are also likely to be affected by the negative economic and other effects resulting from expense, revenue or cash management measures taken to address the Puerto Rico Government\u2019s budgetary and liquidity shortfalls, or measures included in fiscal plans of other government entities, such as the GDB Restructuring Support Agreement. In addition to municipalities, the total direct exposure also includes a $6.8 million loan to a unit of the central government and a $15.1 million loan to an affiliate of a public corporation. The Corporation\u2019s total direct exposure also includes obligations of the Puerto Rico Government, specifically bonds of the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority, at an amortized cost of $8.0 million as part of its available-for-sale investment securities portfolio recorded on its books at a fair value of $6.8 million as of December 31, 2017.\nFurthermore, as of December 31, 2017, the Corporation had three commercial mortgage loans granted to the hotel industry in Puerto Rico that were previously guaranteed by the TDF with an outstanding principal balance of $120.2 million (book value of $70.8 million), compared to $127.7 million outstanding (book value of $111.8 million) as of December 31, 2016. Historically, the borrower and the operations of the underlying collateral of these loans have been the primary sources of repayment and the TDF, which is a subsidiary of the GDB, provided a secondary guarantee for payment performance. As part of agreements executed in the second quarter of 2017 and first quarter of 2018, the TDF paid $7.6 million and $4.0 million, respectively, to honor a portion of its guarantee on these loans. As provided in the agreements, the cash payments received by the Corporation released the TDF from its liability as a guarantor of these loans. As a result, the income-producing real estate properties are now the only collateral of such loans, thus, any decline in collateral valuations may require additional impairments on these loans. All the three TDF commercial mortgage loans have been classified as non-performing and impaired since the first quarter of 2016, and interest payments have been applied against principal since then. Approximately $4.7 million of interest payments received on loans guaranteed by the TDF since late March 2016 have been applied against principal. During 2017, the Corporation recorded charge-offs totaling $30.8 million on these facilities for the portion of the recorded investment in excess of the fair value of the collateral and the guarantee, considering the aforementioned agreements reached with the TDF. In addition, GDB agreed to issue to the Bank a fixed income financial instrument pursuant to the GDB\u2019s Restructuring Support Agreement approved by the PROMESA oversight board. As of December 31, 2017, the non-performing TDF commercial mortgage loans and related facilities are being carried (net of reserves and accumulated charge-offs) at 52% of the unpaid principal balance.\nIn addition, the Corporation had $116.5 million in exposure to residential mortgage loans that are guaranteed by the PRHFA. Residential mortgage loans guaranteed by the PRHFA are secured by the underlying properties and the guarantees serve to cover shortfalls in collateral in the event of a borrower default. The Puerto Rico government guarantees up to $75 million of the principal guaranteed under the mortgage loan insurance program. According to the most recently released audited financial statements of the Puerto Rico Housing Financing Authority, as of June 30, 2015, the PRHFA\u2019s mortgage loan insurance program covered loans in an aggregate of approximately $552 million. The regulations adopted by the PRHFA require the establishment of adequate reserves to guarantee the solvency of the mortgage loan insurance fund. As of June 30, 2015, the most recent date as to which information is available, the PRHFA had a restricted net position for such purposes of approximately $77.4 million.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Corporation had $490.3 million of public sector deposits in Puerto Rico, compared to $408.8 million as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 29% of the public sector deposits in Puerto Rico are from municipalities and municipal agencies and 71% are from public corporations and the central government and agencies.\nThe decline in Puerto Rico\u2019s economy since 2006 and the effects of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017 have resulted in, among other things, a decline in our loan originations, an increase in the level of our non-performing assets and higher loan loss provisions and charge-offs, all of which adversely affected our profitability. Any further deterioration of economic activity could result in further adverse effects on our profitability and credit quality.\nPuerto Rico Government\u2019s filing for bankruptcy may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nOn May 3, 2017, the Puerto Rico government and the PROMESA oversight board filed for a form of bankruptcy in the U.S. District Court in Puerto Rico under Title III of PROMESA. The Title III provision allows for a court debt restructuring process similar to U.S. bankruptcy protection. Since this is the first time that any state or territory of the United States has ever filed for relief that is expected to be comparable to bankruptcy relief because of the absence, until PROMESA, of any legal authority for such a relief, it is uncertain what impact this filing will have on the Corporation. A similar Title III form of bankruptcy was filed for PREPA on July 2, 2017. The Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected as a result of the resolution of the bankruptcy relief filing and further adverse developments in the Puerto Rico government\u2019s fiscal situation given the Corporation\u2019s direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government (excluding municipalities) of $8.0 million of Puerto Rico government debt securities, a $6.8 million loan to an agency of the Puerto Rico central government, and a $15.1 million loan to a PREPA affiliate.\nContinuation of the economic slowdown and decline in the U.S. Virgin Islands could continue to harm our results of operations.\nThe fiscal health of the government of the USVI over the past 10 years has shown signs of deterioration evidenced by persistent budgetary deficits and projected future revenue shortfalls. The government of the USVI developed a five-year financial plan, designed to return the general fund to fiscal stability. The fiscal stabilization plan included a number of revenue enhancement initiatives as well as reductions to government operating expenses. Many of the USVI government\u2019s revenue enhancement initiatives are subject to legislative approval and are in the form of tax increases that could potentially have an adverse effect on the economy. The fiscal stabilization plan is also predicated on access of the government to the financial markets in order to issue deficit financing to cover the operating deficits from 2017 and 2018.\nThe passage of hurricanes Irma and Maria through the region caused significant damage to its core infrastructure, including housing, electricity and the government\u2019s ability to provide certain essential services. Since the hurricane, most schools have reopened, over 96% of energy and water consumers have service, street light fixtures have been repaired or replaced, and tourism has been slowly recovering. Considering the aforementioned challenges, the government has decided to amend the Five Year Strategic Plans in order to create new revenues, reduce public spending, and to create a fair salary payment to public employees. Further declines in the economic activity of this region could result in further adverse effects on our profitability and credit quality.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Corporation has total exposure to the USVI government and its instrumentalities of $70.4 million, approximately $47.2 million was owed by public corporations of the USVI and $23.2 million was owed by an independent instrumentality of the USVI government. All loans are currently performing and up to date on principal and interest payments.\nDifficult market conditions have affected the financial industry and may adversely affect us in the future.\nGiven that most of our business is in Puerto Rico and the United States and given the degree of interrelation between Puerto Rico\u2019s economy and that of the United States, we are exposed to downturns in the U.S. economy, including factors such as unemployment and underemployment levels in the United States and real estate valuations. The deterioration of these conditions could adversely affect the credit performance of mortgage loans, credit default swaps and other derivatives, and result in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions, including government-sponsored entities as well as major commercial banks and investment banks.\nDespite improving labor markets in the U.S. in the past year, an elevated amount of underemployment and household debt, the volatile interest rate environment, along with a continued sluggish recovery in the consumer real estate market and certain commercial real estate markets in the U.S. pose challenges for the U.S. economic performance and the financial services industry.\nIn particular, we may face the following risks:\n\u00b7 Our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select, manage, and underwrite the loans become less predictive of future behaviors.\n\u00b7 The models used to estimate losses inherent in the credit exposure require difficult, subjective, and complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic predictions might impair the ability of the borrowers to repay their loans, which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation and which may, in turn, impact the reliability of the models.\n\u00b7 Our ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to engage in sales of mortgage loans to third parties (including mortgage loan securitization transactions with government-sponsored entities and repurchase agreements) on favorable terms, or at all, could be adversely affected by further disruptions in the capital or credit markets or other events, including deteriorating investor expectations.\n\u00b7 Competitive dynamics in the industry could change as a result of consolidation of financial services companies in connection with current market conditions.\n\u00b7 We expect to face increased regulation of our industry. Compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.\n\u00b7 There may be downward pressure on our stock price.\nThe deterioration of economic conditions in the U.S. and disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to access capital, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe failure of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by future failures of financial institutions and the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We have exposure to different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, investment companies and other institutional clients. In certain of these transactions, we are required to post collateral to secure the obligations to the counterparties. In the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding involving one of such counterparties, we may experience delays in recovering the assets posted as collateral, or we may incur a loss to the extent that the counterparty was holding collateral in excess of the obligation to such counterparty.\nIn addition, many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by our counterparty or client. In addition, the credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. Any losses resulting from our routine funding transactions may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nLegislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may increase our costs and impact our business, governance structure, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe and our subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by multiple regulatory bodies. These regulations may affect the manner and terms of delivery of our services. If we do not comply with governmental regulations, we may be subject to fines, penalties, lawsuits or material restrictions on our businesses in the jurisdiction where the violation occurred, which may adversely affect our business operations. Changes in these regulations can significantly affect the services that we are asked to provide as well as our costs of compliance with such regulations. In addition, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation arising from the failure or perceived failure to comply with legal, regulatory or contractual requirements could affect our ability to attract and retain customers.\nThe financial crisis of 2008 resulted in regulatory agencies and political bodies placing increased focus and scrutiny on the financial services industry. The U.S. government intervened on an unprecedented scale, responding by temporarily enhancing the liquidity support available to financial institutions, establishing a commercial paper funding facility, temporarily guaranteeing money market funds and certain types of debt issuances and increasing insurance on bank deposits.\nThese programs have subjected financial institutions to additional restrictions, oversight and costs. In addition, new proposals for legislation are periodically introduced in the U.S. Congress that could further substantially increase regulation of the financial services industry, impose restrictions on the operations and general ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices, including in the areas of interest rates, financial product offerings and disclosures, and have an effect on bankruptcy proceedings with respect to consumer residential real estate mortgages, among other things. Federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied.\nRegulatory uncertainty caused by financial deregulation measures proposed by the Trump administration and members of the U.S. Congress may increase competition in certain of our investment strategies and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s short-term legislative agenda includes certain deregulatory measures for the U.S. financial services industry, including changes to the Volcker Rule, the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, the Basel III capital requirements, the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Financial Stability Oversight Council\u2019s (the \u201cFSOC\u2019s\u201d) authority and other aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act. On February 3, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order calling for the administration to review U.S. financial laws and regulations in order to determine their consistency with a set of core principles identified in the order. One bill, the Financial CHOICE Act (the \u201cCHOICE Act\u201d), which has been passed by the U.S. House of Representatives but has not been enacted into law as of this date, is being discussed as an avenue for amending Dodd-Frank. The current version of the CHOICE Act would eliminate the power of the FSOC to designate non-bank financial institutions as systematically important, repeal the Volcker Rule and change the structure and powers of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In addition, the CHOICE Act would allow certain qualifying banking organizations with a satisfactory composite supervisory rating and a non-risk weighted leverage ratio of at least 10% to elect to be exempt from enhanced risk-weighted capital ratios, liquidity requirements and other regulations currently applicable to large banking organizations. It would also revise the U.S. Risk Retention Rules to remove the risk retention requirement for all asset-backed securitizations other than for certain non-qualifying residential mortgage securitizations. The CHOICE Act also would significantly alter stress testing, possibly exempting qualifying banking organizations from stress testing altogether and eliminating the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s ability to make \u201cqualitative\u201d objections to capital plans submitted by other banking organizations. In addition, the CHOICE Act would also significantly enhance the SEC\u2019s enforcement capabilities and increase the maximum civil penalties and criminal sanctions under federal securities laws, including under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The U.S. Senate similarly is considering more limited changes to the Dodd-Frank Act, including measures to lessen the regulatory burdens on community and mid-sized banking organizations.\nWhether the CHOICE Act or the U.S. Senate bill will be enacted, and, if so, whether additional amendments would be added during the legislative process remains unclear. In the absence of legislative change, however, the Trump administration may influence the substance of regulatory supervision through, among other things, the appointment of individuals to the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the CFPB. The administration recently nominated, and the Senate confirmed, Jerome Powell as Chair of the Federal Reserve Board, and Randal Quarles as a Governor and new Vice Chairman for Supervision. Further, President Trump is expected to nominate persons to fill several other of the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s seven seats. In turn, the appointment of new Federal Reserve Board members may increase the likelihood that the Federal Reserve Board modify the capital and liquidity requirements for U.S. banking organizations that are more stringent than those that have been agreed upon at the international level, including the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\u2019s Basel III framework. The Trump administration has also nominated Jelena McWilliams, a former Senate Banking Committee senior staff member and banking industry executive, as Chair of the FDIC.\nThe CFPB\u2019s programs and operations may be affected by the designation of Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, as acting Director of the CFPB, and by President Trump\u2019s likely nomination in the future of a permanent Director. Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s initial actions as acting Director have been largely consistent with the announced deregulatory agenda of the Trump administration. The impact of these and other future actions on the CFPB\u2019s regulatory and enforcement activities as they affect FirstBank, however, cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time.\nMeasures focused on deregulation of the U.S. financial services industry may have the effect of increasing competition for our credit-focused businesses or otherwise reducing investment opportunities. Increased competition from banks and other financial institutions in the credit markets could have the effect of reducing credit spreads, which may adversely affect the revenues of our credit and other businesses whose strategies include the provision of credit to borrowers.\nDetermining the full extent of the impact on us of any such potential financial reform legislation, or whether any such particular proposal will become law, or the impact of regulatory changes in the absence of legislation at this point in time is highly speculative. However, any such changes may impose additional costs on us, require the attention of our senior management or Board or result in limitations on the manner in which business is conducted.\nFinancial services legislation and regulatory reforms may have a significant impact on our business and results of operations and on our credit ratings.\nAs discussed above, the Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act includes, and the regulations developed and to be developed thereunder include or will include, provisions affecting large and small financial institutions alike. In addition, U.S. banking organizations, including the Corporation and FirstBank, are subject to new and more stringent regulatory capital requirements that generally increase the amounts of capital that we need to hold.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Corporation had $202 million in trust-preferred securities that are now subject to the full phase-out from Tier 1 capital under the final regulatory capital rules discussed above.\nAlthough First BanCorp. and FirstBank were able to meet general well-capitalized capital ratios upon implementation of the requirements, and we expect both companies will continue to exceed the minimum risk-based and leverage capital ratio requirements for well-capitalized status under the new capital rules, we may not remain at such levels.\nAdditional regulatory proposals and legislation, if finally adopted, could change banking laws and our operating environment and that of our subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways. The ultimate effect that such legislation, if enacted, or regulations would have upon our financial condition or results of operations may be adverse.\nWe are subject to regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and if we fail to meet these guidelines our business and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nUnder regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and other regulatory requirements, the Corporation and our banking subsidiary must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off balance sheet items, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators regarding components, risk weightings and other factors. If we fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, our business and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. If we fail to maintain certain capital levels, or are deemed not well managed under regulatory exam procedures, or if we experience certain regulatory violations, our status as a financial holding company, and our ability to offer certain financial products will be compromised and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRulemaking changes implemented by the CFPB will result in higher regulatory and compliance costs related to originating and servicing residential mortgage loans and may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the regulation of single-family residential mortgage lending in the United States. Among other things, the law transferred rule-making and enforcement powers from a number of federal agencies to the CFPB, imposed new risk retention and recordkeeping requirements on lenders (such as the Bank) that sell single-family residential mortgage loans in the secondary market, required revision of disclosure documents, limited loan originator compensation and expanded recordkeeping and reporting requirements under other federal statutes.\nNew regulations implement the Dodd-Frank Act amendments to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. See \u201cBusiness - Regulation and Supervision - Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\u201d\nAmong other consequences of these numerous changes, the requirements relating to the evaluation of the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan may result in reduced credit availability and higher borrowing costs to cover the costs of compliance. The ability of borrowers to raise new defenses in foreclosure proceedings on defaulted mortgage loans also may lead to increased foreclosure costs, extend foreclosure timelines, and increase the severity of loan losses. Increased repurchase and indemnity requests with respect to mortgage loans sold into the secondary markets may also result.\nThese and other changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act have required substantial modifications to the entire mortgage lending and servicing industry. Their impact may involve changes to our operations and increased compliance costs in making single-family residential mortgage loans.\nCompliance with stress testing requirements may be challenging.\nThe Corporation is currently subject to supervisory guidance for stress testing practices issued by the federal banking agencies. The current guidance outlines broad principles for a satisfactory stress testing framework and describes various stress testing approaches and how stress testing should be used at various levels within an organization. As previously discussed, the Corporation is also subject to two new stress testing rules that implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, one issued by the Federal Reserve Board that applies to First BanCorp. on a consolidated basis and one issued by the FDIC that applies to the Bank.\nThe Corporation submitted its third annual company-run stress test to regulators in July 2017, which was published in October 2017.\nFuture public disclosure of stress test results could result in reputational harm if the Corporation\u2019s results are worse than those of its competitors or otherwise indicate that the Corporation\u2019s risk profile is excessive or elevated. Furthermore, given that the Corporation will be subject to multiple stress testing requirements that are administered at different levels by more than one federal banking agency, and compliance with such requirements will be complicated, if the Corporation fails to fully comply with these requirements, it may be subject to regulatory action.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve Board. An important function of the Federal Reserve Board is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in reserve requirements for bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adverse.\nWe are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution's performance under the Community Reinvestment Act or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution's performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action related to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Drug Enforcement Administration. We are also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with trade and economic sanctions requirements and rules enforced by OFAC. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATING TO AN INVESTMENT IN THE CORPORATION\u2019S COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK\nIssuance of additional equity securities in the public markets and other capital management or business strategies that we may pursue could depress the market price of our common stock and could result in dilution of holders of our common stock, including purchasers of our common stock under the resale registration statement.\nGenerally, we are not restricted from issuing additional equity securities, including common stock. We may choose to sell additional equity securities, or we could be required in the future to identify, consider and pursue additional capital management strategies to bolster our capital position. We may issue equity securities (including convertible securities, preferred securities, and options and warrants on our common or preferred stock securities) in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy, adjust our leverage ratio, address regulatory capital concerns, restructure currently outstanding debt or equity securities or satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants. Future issuances of our equity securities, including common stock, in any transaction that we may pursue may dilute the interests of our existing holders of our common stock and preferred stock and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nThe Corporation has outstanding a warrant held by the U.S. Treasury to purchase 1,285,899 shares of common stock. If the warrant is exercised, the issuance of shares of common stock could reduce our income per share, and further reduce the book value per share and voting power of our current common stockholders.\nThe market price of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations and volatility.\nThe stock markets have frequently experienced high levels of volatility since 2008. These market fluctuations have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the market price of our common stock has been subject to significant fluctuations and volatility because of factors specifically related to our businesses and may continue to fluctuate or decline.\nFactors that could cause fluctuations, volatility or a decline in the market price of our common stock, many of which could be beyond our control, include the following:\n\u00b7 uncertainties and developments related to the resolution of the Puerto Rico government\u2019s fiscal problems;\n\u00b7 any regulatory actions against us;\n\u00b7 changes or perceived changes in the condition, operations, results or prospects of our businesses and market assessments of these changes or perceived changes;\n\u00b7 announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors, including any failures of banks;\n\u00b7 changes in governmental regulations or proposals, or new governmental regulations or proposals, affecting us;\n\u00b7 a continuing recession in the Puerto Rico market and a lack of growth in our other principal markets in the USVI, the BVI and the U.S.;\n\u00b7 the departure of key employees;\n\u00b7 changes in the credit, mortgage and real estate markets;\n\u00b7 operating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors;\n\u00b7 operating and stock price performance of companies that investors deem comparable to us; and\n\u00b7 the public perception of the banking industry and its safety and soundness.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the NYSE and the other trading markets for the securities of commercial banks and other financial services companies in particular, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that sometimes have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance or Puerto Rico\u2019s economic environment. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs, potential liabilities and the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur suspension of dividends may have adversely affected and may further adversely affect our stock price and could result in the expansion of our Board of Directors.\nIn consideration of the financial results reported for the second quarter ended June 30, 2009, we decided, as a matter of prudent fiscal management and following applicable Federal Reserve Board guidance, to suspend the payment of dividends. The Corporation\u2019s ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain Federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board regarding capital adequacy and the approval of the Federal Reserve to declare or pay dividends and receive dividends from the Bank to fund any such dividend payments. In December 2016, for the first time since July 2009, the Corporation paid dividends on its non-cumulative perpetual monthly income preferred stock, after receiving regulatory approval. Since then, the Corporation has continued to paid monthly dividend payments on the non-cumulative perpetual monthly income preferred stock. The Corporation has received regulatory approval to pay monthly dividends on the Corporation\u2019s series A through E preferred stock through March 2018. The Corporation intends to continue to request the Federal Reserve\u2019s approval to continue to pay the monthly dividends on its Series A through E Preferred Stock.\nIf the Corporation does not pay dividends in full for eighteen monthly dividend periods (whether consecutive or not), the holders of the Series A through E Preferred Stock as to which dividends have not been paid for eighteen months, acting as a single class, will be entitled to appoint two additional members to our Board of Directors. Any member of the Board of Directors appointed by the holders of Series A through E Preferred Stock is required to vacate his or her office if the Corporation resumes the payment of dividends in full for twelve consecutive monthly dividend periods.", "PERMNO": 11018, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FBP"}
