Risk Factors\nOur results of operations and financial condition can be adversely affected by numerous risks. You should carefully consider the risk factors detailed below in conjunction with the other information contained in this document. Should any of these risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted.\nAs a result of our reliance on foreign sourcing for our products:\n\u00b7 Our ability to service customers could be adversely affected and result in lower sales, earnings and liquidity.\nOur supply of goods could be interrupted for a variety of reasons. Physical damage from a natural disaster, fire or other cause to any one of our sourcing partners\u2019 factories could interrupt production for an extended period of time. Our sourcing partners may not supply goods that meet our manufacturing, quality or safety specifications in a timely manner and at an acceptable price. We may reject goods that do not meet our specifications, requiring us to find alternative sourcing arrangements at a higher cost, or possibly forcing us to discontinue the product. Also, delivery of goods from our foreign sourcing partners may be delayed for reasons not typically encountered with domestic manufacturing or sourcing, such as shipment delays caused by customs or labor issues.\n\u00b7 Our ability to properly forecast consumer demand on product with extended lead times could result in lower sales, earnings and liquidity.\nOur use of foreign sources exposes us to risks associated with forecasting future demand on product with extended order lead times. Extended order lead times may adversely affect our ability to respond to sudden changes in demand, resulting in the purchase of excess inventory in the face of declining demand, or lost sales due to insufficient inventory in the face of increasing demand, either of which could have an adverse effect on our sales, earnings and liquidity.\n\u00b7 Changes in political, economic and social conditions, as well as laws and regulations, in the countries from which we source products could adversely affect us.\nForeign sourcing is subject to political and social instability in countries where our sourcing partners are located. This could make it more difficult for us to service our customers. Also, significant fluctuations of foreign exchange rates against the value of the U.S. dollar could increase costs and decrease earnings.\n\u00b7 International trade policies of the United States and countries from which we source products could adversely affect us.\nImposition of trade sanctions relating to imports, taxes, import duties and other charges on imports\ncould increase our costs and decrease our earnings.\n\u00b7 Changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar compared to the currencies for the countries from which we obtain our products could adversely affect our sales, earnings and liquidity.\nFor imported products, we generally negotiate firm pricing with our foreign suppliers in U.S. Dollars, typically for periods of at least one year. We accept the exposure to exchange rate movements beyond these negotiated periods. We do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this risk but could choose to do so in the future. Since we transact our imported product purchases in U.S. Dollars, a relative decline in the value of the U.S Dollar could increase the price we must pay for imported products beyond the negotiated periods. These price changes could decrease our sales, earnings and liquidity during affected periods.\nWe may not be able to maintain or to raise prices in response to inflation and increasing costs.\nFuture market and competitive pressures may prohibit us from successfully raising prices to offset increased costs of finished goods, freight and other inflationary items. This could lower our earnings.\nWe may not be able to sustain sales, earnings and liquidity levels due to economic downturns.\nThe furniture industry historically has been cyclical in nature and has fluctuated with economic cycles. During economic downturns, the furniture industry tends to experience longer periods of recession and greater declines than the general economy. We believe that the industry is significantly influenced by economic conditions generally and particularly by housing activity, consumer confidence, the level of personal discretionary spending, demographics and credit availability. These factors not only affect the ultimate consumer, but also impact smaller independent brick-&-mortar furniture retailers, which are our primary customers. As a result, a worsening of current conditions could lower our sales and earnings and impact our liquidity.\nBusiness failures, or the loss, of large customers could result in a decrease in our future sales and earnings.\nAlthough we have no single customer representing 10% or more of our total annual sales, the possibility of business failures, or the loss of large customers could result in a decrease of our future sales and earnings. Lost sales may be difficult to replace and any amounts owed to us may become uncollectible.\nFailure to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer tastes, fashions and perceived values in a timely manner could result in a decrease in our sales and earnings.\nResidential furniture is a fashion business based upon products styled for a changing marketplace and is sometimes subject to changing consumer trends and tastes. If we are unable to predict or respond to changes in these trends and tastes in a timely manner, we may lose sales and have to sell excess inventory at reduced prices. This could lower our sales and earnings.\nWe may not be able to sustain current sales and earnings due to the actions and strength of our competitors.\nThe furniture industry is very competitive and fragmented. We compete with mostly overseas vendors who sell directly to retailers, retailers who are vertically integrated and other wholesale marketing and logistics companies in the furniture industry. In addition, some competitors have greater financial resources than we have and often offer extensively advertised, highly promoted products. As a result, we are continually subject to the risk of losing market share, which may lower our sales and earnings.\nOur business and operations would be adversely impacted in the event of a failure or interruption of our information technology infrastructure.\nThe proper functioning of our information technology infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation and management of our business. If our information technology systems fail or are interrupted, our operations may be adversely affected and operating results could be harmed. Our information technology systems, and those of third parties providing service to us, may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control. These include catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, computer system or network failures, viruses or malware, physical or electronic break-ins, unauthorized access and cyber attacks. Any material disruption, malfunction or similar challenges with our information technology infrastructure, or disruptions or challenges relating to the transition to new processes, systems or providers, could have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business and our results of operations.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and we cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses of significant deficiencies will not occur in the future. If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price.\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over financial reporting was identified by management that existed in prior years but was remediated as of December 31, 2014, related to the design and effectiveness of internal controls over the application of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) with respect to determining the method of computation of the liability for our deferred compensation plan. In addition, our management determined that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2014, due to a material weakness related to the ineffective design, documentation and maintenance of effective internal controls over our period-end financial reporting processes related to the preparation and analysis of account reconciliations and estimates primarily related to accounts payable and certain expenses. If our remediation efforts for the above material weakness is not successful, or if other material weaknesses arise in the future, our ability to properly manage the business may be impaired and we may be unable to accurately report our financial results. This could result in previously reported financial results being restated, which could result in a loss of investor confidence and may lead to a decline in our stock price.\nWe depend on key personnel and could be affected by the loss of their services.\nThe success of our business depends upon the services of certain senior executives. The loss of any such person or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFuture cost of compliance with environmental, safety and health regulations could reduce our earnings.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations in the areas of safety, health and environmental protection. The timing and ultimate magnitude of costs for compliance with environmental, health and safety regulations are difficult to predict and could reduce our earnings.", "PERMNO": 78068, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "STLY"}
