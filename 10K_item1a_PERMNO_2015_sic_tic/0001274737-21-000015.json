You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and related notes and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d before making an investment decision to purchase or sell shares of our common stock. If any of the following risks are realized, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. The risks described below are not the only ones that we may face, and additional risks or uncertainties not known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and future prospects.\nSummary Risk Factors\nThe risk factors described below are a summary of the principal risk factors associated with an investment in us. These are not the only risks we face. You should carefully consider these risk factors, together with the risk factors set forth in this Item 1A:\n\u2022Our business is subject to risks arising from epidemic diseases, such as the global pandemic of the COVID-19 coronavirus;\n\u2022We have a history of losses, we expect to incur net losses in the future and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve and maintain profitability;\n\u2022In the near-term, we expect that our financial results will depend primarily on sales of our testing products, and we will need to generate sufficient revenue from these testing products to grow our business;\n\u2022Our future growth depends, in part, on our ability to execute on our strategy of integrating the promotion of our existing and future proprietary testing products with the promotion of therapeutics, and we may be unsuccessful in our promotion efforts for SIMPONI\u00ae, which could adversely affect our ability to implement this strategy;\n\u2022We may be unable to manage our ongoing growth effectively, which could make it difficult to execute our business strategy;\n\u2022If we lose or are unable to secure partners for our integrated testing and therapeutics strategy, or if our partners do not apply adequate resources to their relationships with us or are unable to provide, on a timely basis, an adequate and reliable supply of the therapeutics that we promote, our potential for profitability may be adversely affected;\n\u2022Our commercial success depends on attaining and maintaining significant market acceptance of our testing products and promoted therapeutics among rheumatologists, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community;\n\u2022We rely on sole suppliers for some of the reagents, equipment and other materials used in our testing products, and we may not be able to fund replacements or transition to alternative suppliers;\n\u2022If we are unable to support demand for our current testing products or any of our future testing products or solutions, our business could suffer;\n\u2022If third-party payors do not provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for our testing products, or they breach, rescind or modify their contracts or reimbursement policies or delay payments for our testing products or promoted therapeutics, or if we or our partners are unable to successfully negotiate payor contracts, our commercial success could be compromised;\n\u2022If we are unable to compete successfully, we may be unable to increase or sustain our revenue or achieve profitability;\n\u2022Developing new testing products involves a lengthy and complex process, and we may not be able to commercialize on a timely basis, or at all, other testing products we are developing;\n\u2022If our sole laboratory facility becomes damaged or inoperable, we are required to vacate our existing facility or we are unable to expand our existing facility as needed, we will be unable to perform our testing services and our business will be harmed;\n\u2022We may require substantial additional capital to finance our planned operations, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our failure to obtain additional financing when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce or eliminate our product development programs, commercialization efforts or other operations;\n\u2022If we are unable to maintain intellectual property protection our competitive position could be harmed; and\n\u2022If we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license intellectual property rights from third parties or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Strategy\nOur business is subject to risks arising from epidemic diseases, such as the global pandemic of the COVID-19 coronavirus.\nThe current COVID-19 worldwide pandemic has presented substantial public health challenges and is affecting our employees, patients, physicians and other healthcare providers, communities and business operations, as well as the U.S. and global economies and financial markets. International and U.S. governmental authorities in impacted regions are taking actions in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19, including issuing varying forms of \"stay-at-home\" orders, restricting business functions outside of one's home, restricting gatherings, restricting travel, and mandating social distancing and face coverings. Certain jurisdictions have begun re-opening only to return to restrictions due to increases in new COVID-19 cases. Even in areas where \"stay-at-home\" restrictions have been lifted and the number of COVID-19 cases have declined, many individuals remain cautious about resuming activities such as preventative-care medical visits. A pandemic, including COVID-19 or other public health epidemic, poses the risk that we or our employees, contractors, suppliers, third-party shipping carries, government and third-party payors and other partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to spread of the disease within these groups or due to shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. As a result of COVID-19 related limitations and reordering of priorities across the U.S. healthcare system, a reduction in patient flow occurred and our test volumes began to decrease in the second half of March 2020. We experienced an AVISE\u00ae CTD volume decrease of approximately 5% in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019. By the end of the third quarter of 2020, the number of AVISE\u00ae CTD tests delivered substantially recovered to pre-COVID-19 AVISE\u00ae CTD tests reported in the first quarter of 2020, and in the fourth quarter of 2020, the number of AVISE\u00ae CTD tests delivered exceeded our pre-COVID-19 AVISE\u00ae CTD tests reported in the first quarter of 2020. For the three months ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, we experienced a AVISE\u00ae CTD volume increase of approximately 5%. However, the continued spread of COVID-19 may adversely affect testing volumes in future periods, the extent of which is highly uncertain. Healthcare providers and patients have canceled or delayed scheduling, and for an extended period of time may continue to cancel or delay scheduling, standard wellness visits and other non-emergency appointments and procedures, contributing to a decline in orders of our testing products. The economic downturn may also result in closures of the practices of our primary customers. As it relates to our promotion efforts of SIMPONI\u00ae, we may experience decreased demand for or discontinued treatment with SIMPONI\u00ae from patients who are infected by COVID-19 or who may be at higher risk of infection if it is determined that such patients should minimize exposure to immunosuppressant therapies.\nIn addition, we believe there are several other important factors that have impacted, and that we expect will impact our operating performance and results of operations, including shutdowns of our facilities and operations as well as those of our suppliers and courier services, disruptions to the supply chain of material needed for our tests, our\nsales and commercialization activities and our ability to receive specimens and perform or deliver the results from our tests, delays in reimbursement and coverage decisions from Medicare and third-party payors and in interactions with regulatory authorities, as well as our inability to achieve or re-negotiate volume-based discounts with our key suppliers and to absorb fixed laboratory expenses. For example, we have experienced delays in patient enrollment for ongoing and planned clinical studies involving our tests, which may delay or prevent launch of future test products. Our salesforce has been, and for an extended period of time may continue to be limited to their in-person interactions with healthcare providers, and therefore, also limited their ability to engage in various types of healthcare provider education activities. The portion of our workforce which has been working remotely in an effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19, may be infected from the virus or otherwise distracted. We have also experienced delays in procurement of our testing supplies due to the resurgence of varying forms of \"stay-at-home\" orders in the fourth quarter of 2020, which may continue into the future, and our partners, including Janssen, may also experience a disruption in their ability to readily obtain supply. We may also face increased competition for laboratory employees due to the increased demand in the industry for such personnel. We may inaccurately estimate the duration or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could cause us to misalign our staffing, spending, activities and precautionary measures with market current or future market conditions.\nOur laboratory operations, including laboratory employees and medical directors, may be subject to closure or shut down, either due to the spread of the disease within these individuals, or as part of a larger scale government recommendation or mandate. Any disruption in our laboratory operations would have a material adverse effect on our business and would impede our ability to process tests in a timely manner, or at all.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation measures have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on global economic conditions which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition, including impairing our ability to raise capital on a timely basis or at all. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus and the actions to contain its impact. COVID-19 may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this section.\nWe have a history of losses, we expect to incur net losses in the future and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve and maintain profitability.\nWe have incurred net losses since our inception. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred net losses of $16.7 and $12.0 million, respectively, and we expect to incur additional losses in 2021 and in future years. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $181.3 million. Over the next several years, we expect to continue to devote substantially all of our resources to increase adoption of, and reimbursement for, our testing products, to develop future testing products and to continue to execute our integrated testing and therapeutics strategy. We have experienced and may continue to experience decreases in test volumes due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve and maintain profitability. Our failure to achieve and maintain profitability in the future could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe only recently began transitioning toward an integrated testing and therapeutics strategy, and have experienced material fluctuations in our ability to drive meaningful revenue from the promotion of therapeutics. Consequently, any predictions about our future success, performance or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer history of utilizing an integrated testing and therapeutics strategy in addition to the sale of our testing products.\nIn the near-term, we expect that our financial results will depend primarily on sales of our testing products, and we will need to generate sufficient revenue from these testing products to grow our business.\nA significant majority of our historical revenue has been derived from the sale of our AVISE\u00ae CTD testing product, which we commercially launched in 2012. In the near term, we expect to continue to derive a majority of our revenue from sales of AVISE\u00ae CTD. We are in various stages of research and development with respect to other testing products that we may offer, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to commercialize these testing products.\nThe demand for our testing products may decrease or may not continue to increase at historical rates for a number of reasons. In addition, at any point in time we may decide to no longer commercialize any of our testing products for any number of reasons. While we have experienced revenue growth from the sale of our testing products, we may not be able to sustain this growth or maintain existing revenue levels. Further, we cannot ensure the continued\navailability of our testing products in commercial quantities at acceptable costs. If we are unable to increase sales of our testing products, expand reimbursement for our testing products, or successfully develop and commercialize additional testing products, our revenue and our ability to achieve and sustain profitability would be impaired, and the market price of our common stock could decline.\nOur future growth depends, in part, on our ability to execute on our strategy of integrating the promotion of our existing and future proprietary testing products with the promotion of therapeutics, and we may be unsuccessful in our promotion efforts for SIMPONI\u00ae, which could adversely affect our ability to implement this strategy.\nWe are in the process of integrating our historical testing products business with the promotion of therapeutics in an integrated testing and therapeutics strategy. Our integrated testing and therapeutics strategy leverages our sales and marketing efforts, targeting rheumatologists for the commercialization of our testing products to promote therapeutics. As a result, our future growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to leverage our unique commercial model of offering testing products combined with therapeutics, including with respect to the Janssen Agreement, which we entered into in December 2018 to exclusively promote SIMPONI\u00ae in the United States. Pursuant to the Janssen Agreement, we are entitled to receive a tiered promotion fee based on the total number of incremental prescriptions written above an established baseline. Our ability to continue to effectively co-promote SIMPONI\u00ae will require us to be successful in a range of activities, including creating demand for SIMPONI\u00ae through our commercial and sales activities as well as those of Janssen. Moreover, we may encounter difficulties in maintaining an effective salesforce in furtherance of our promotion efforts for SIMPONI\u00ae, which could have a material impact on our ability to continue to successfully generate co-promotion revenue. If we encounter difficulties promoting SIMPONI\u00ae, our ability to generate significant revenue under the Amended Janssen Agreement will be harmed. In addition, in June 2020 we amended the Janssen Agreement, pursuant to which the predetermined average baseline for each remaining quarter in 2020, starting with the quarter ended June 30, 2020, was adjusted to approximately 26,000 prescribed units per quarter, due in part to COVID-19 and subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. In December 2020, we further amended the Janssen Agreement, pursuant to which the predetermined average baseline for total prescribed units of SIMPONI\u00ae for the quarters ending December 31, 2020, March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021, was adjusted to approximately 28,750 prescribed units per quarter, subject to further adjustment under certain circumstances. Pursuant to the Amended Janssen Agreement, for each of the first and second quarters of 2021, we will receive a minimum promotion fee of $0.3 million and the fee will be capped at 10% above the adjusted predetermined baseline. The quarterly tiered promotion fee for the remaining term of the Amended Janssen Agreement beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2021 will revert to the terms set forth in the Janssen Agreement prior to the amendment, with no minimum promotion fee and no cap on predetermined baseline units. However, based on the revised predetermined baseline we don't anticipate generating meaningful revenue beyond the minimum promotion fee for the first half of 2021, and may not generate any meaningful revenue thereafter. The Janssen Agreement expires on December 31, 2021, unless extended by us for an additional 12 months upon 180 days written notice prior to the end of the current term. Janssen also has the right to terminate the Janssen Agreement with or without cause after 30-days\u2019 notice, including if we are unable to agree to a new baseline for 2022. If Janssen were to exercise this right, we may be unable to recoup substantial investments we have made and intend to make in order to support the promotion of SIMPONI\u00ae. We have a limited history partnering with pharmaceutical companies for the promotion of therapeutics. Consequently, any predictions made about our future success or viability with respect to our promotion activities may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a history of successfully co-promoting therapeutics.\nIf we fail to successfully promote SIMPONI\u00ae, our ability to implement our integrated testing and therapeutics strategy and generate sufficient revenue to grow and sustain our business, and our business, financial condition and results of operations, will be materially adversely affected. This may also adversely affect our ability to secure additional therapeutic promotion opportunities.\nWe may be unable to manage our ongoing and future growth effectively, which could make it difficult to execute our business strategy.\nIn addition to the need to scale our testing capacity, our future growth plans will also impose significant added responsibilities on management, including the need to identify, recruit, train and integrate additional employees and the need to manage additional relationships with various partners, suppliers and other third parties. In particular, we have 53 representatives as of December 31, 2020 compared to 50 representatives as of December 31, 2019, and expect to continue to expand our salesforce in 2021, which we believe will help increase reach and frequency and support our integrated promotion of testing products and therapeutics. In addition, rapid and significant growth may strain our administrative and operational infrastructure and require us to expand our financial, development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us. Our ability to manage our business and growth, as well as function as a public company, will require us to\ncontinue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. The time and resources required to optimize these systems is uncertain, and failure to complete optimization in a timely and efficient manner could adversely affect our operations. If we are unable to manage our ongoing and future growth effectively, it may be difficult for us to execute our business strategy and our business could be harmed.\nIf we lose or are unable to secure partners for our integrated testing and therapeutics strategy, or if our partners do not apply adequate resources to their relationships with us or are unable to provide, on a timely basis, an adequate and reliable supply of the therapeutics that we promote, our potential for profitability may be adversely affected.\nIn addition to the Janssen Agreement, we plan to opportunistically evaluate, and may continue to enter into, additional agreements with pharmaceutical companies to integrate the promotion of our testing products with their therapeutics. We have also entered into, and may continue to enter into, other agreements that leverage our testing products and/or data generated from such tests. For example, we provide GSK our test result data to provide market insight into and help increase awareness of the benefits of an early and accurate diagnosis of SLE and monitoring disease activity.\nThe amount and timing of resources applied by our current or potential future partners are largely outside of our control. For example, we have limited control over, and rely on Janssen for, numerous activities that are critical to our ability to successfully promote SIMPONI\u00ae, such as pricing decisions, manufacture and supply of SIMPONI\u00ae, reimbursement support, marketing materials, the prosecution and enforcement of patents and other intellectual property rights related to SIMPONI\u00ae and public communications and presentations regarding SIMPONI\u00ae. We likewise have limited control of how our other partners use the information provided by our testing products.\nIf any of our current or future partners breaches or terminates our agreements, or fails to conduct the activities contemplated by our agreements in a timely manner, our success promoting the applicable therapeutics, testing products or information provided thereby could be diminished or blocked completely. It is possible that partners will change their strategic focus, pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products, either on their own or in collaboration with others. For example, under the Janssen Agreement, Janssen is not prohibited from developing or commercializing products that are competitive with SIMPONI\u00ae. If Janssen commercializes any competing products, it may provide lower levels of support to SIMPONI\u00ae or may terminate our agreement entirely. The effectiveness of our partners, if any, in marketing the applicable therapeutics will also affect our revenue and earnings. In addition, if our other partners encounter problems with our testing products or information provided by our testing products that they rely on as part of their efforts, our reputation and that of our testing products could be damaged, and it could impair our ability to enter into future agreements to promote therapeutics.\nWe rely on Janssen to provide, on a timely basis, an adequate and reliable supply of SIMPONI\u00ae. Any delay or interruption of supply or Janssen\u2019s failure to comply with regulatory or other requirements could limit its ability to make, or cause it to cease sales, of SIMPONI\u00ae. Any manufacturing defect or error discovered after SIMPONI\u00ae has been produced and distributed could result in even more significant consequences, including costly recall procedures. In addition, the importation of pharmaceutical products into the United States is subject to regulation by the FDA, and the FDA can refuse to allow an imported product into the United States if it appears that the product fails to comply with applicable laws or regulations. Moreover, Janssen and its third-party manufacturers and suppliers may experience difficulties related to their overall business and financial stability. For example, in December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, has resulted in business closures and a limit on travel, as well as creating uncertainty in the broader economy and financial markets. Any disruption, including the extent to which COVID-19 has an effect on Janssen, may impact our ability to readily obtain supply and other requirements under our agreement with Janssen. To the extent Janssen faces manufacturing difficulties or is unable to provide an adequate and reliable supply of SIMPONI\u00ae on a timely basis, our reputation could be harmed and our business could suffer.\nWe do not have the capability and do not intend to discover or develop therapeutics on our own. Therefore, the success of our integrated testing and therapeutics strategy depends in part on our ability to acquire additional rights to promote therapeutics from new or existing partners. Other companies, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and sales resources than we do, also compete with us for the acquisition of rights to therapeutics. In addition, under the Janssen Agreement, we are prohibited from selling or promoting certain types of products that are used to treat the same indications that SIMPONI\u00ae is used to treat. We may not be able to successfully negotiate any additional agreements to promote therapeutics and, if established, these relationships may not be successful. For example, potential partners, particularly those that are actively marketing their own therapeutics, may be unwilling to license commercialization rights to us or otherwise enter into terms that allow us to meaningfully participate in sales growth for their products, which could limit the potential availability and value to us of additional agreements to promote therapeutics. The inability to enter into agreements for additional therapeutics\ncould limit the overall growth of our business and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Disputes could also arise between us and our existing or future partners, as to a variety of matters, including financial and intellectual property matters or other obligations under our agreements. These disputes would be both expensive and time-consuming and may result in delays in the success of therapeutics or could damage our relationship with a partner.\nWe may experience limits on our revenue if rheumatologists decide not to order our testing products or our promoted therapeutics or if we are otherwise unable to create or maintain demand for our testing products and promoted therapeutics.\nIf we are unable to create or maintain demand for either our testing products or promoted therapeutics in sufficient volume, we may not generate sufficient revenue to become profitable. To generate increased demand, we will need to continue to educate rheumatologists about the benefits of our testing products through publications in peer-reviewed medical journals, presentations at medical conferences and other similar means. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we were featured in six scientific presentations at the 2020 American College of Rheumatology's (ACR) Virtual Annual Conference, ACR Convergence 2020. We will also need to generate demand for both our testing products and promoted therapeutics through one-on-one education by our salesforce. We also plan to focus on educating patients about the benefits of these testing products and therapeutics, which we believe will be necessary to generate further demand. In addition, our inability to obtain and maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors may limit adoption by rheumatologists, as well as third-party payors exerting pressure on rheumatologists and healthcare providers to order in-network testing products which could adversely affect our revenue. With respect to SIMPONI\u00ae in particular, if we are unable to generate sales above certain thresholds agreed to with Janssen, we will not generate meaningful revenue under the Amended Janssen Agreement.\nRheumatologists may rely on guidelines issued by industry groups regarding the diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and monitoring of autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases, and the monitoring of the effectiveness of therapeutic drugs used to treat such diseases before utilizing any diagnostic test or monitoring solution.\nOur commercial success depends upon attaining and maintaining significant market acceptance of our testing products and promoted therapeutics among rheumatologists, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community.\nOur success depends on our ability to continue to develop and market testing products and promote therapeutics that are recognized and accepted as safe, effective, reliable and cost effective, and any testing product or promoted therapeutic that we offer may not gain or maintain market acceptance among rheumatologists, third-party payors, patients and the medical community. Market acceptance of our testing products and promoted therapeutics depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022the perceived accuracy of our test results by rheumatologists and patients;\n\u2022the potential and perceived advantages of our testing products and promoted therapeutics over alternative products and therapeutics;\n\u2022the demonstration in clinical studies of the performance and clinical validity of our testing products, the results of which studies may not replicate the positive results from earlier studies;\n\u2022the demonstration of clinical efficacy and safety of our promoted therapeutics compared to other more-established products;\n\u2022the introduction of new tests or therapeutics products that compete with our testing products or our promoted therapeutics or the introduction of generic versions of our promoted therapeutics;\n\u2022the product cost in relation to alternative products;\n\u2022the prevalence and severity of any adverse effects from our promoted therapeutics;\n\u2022the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of rheumatologists to prescribe these therapies;\n\u2022any restrictions on the use of our promoted therapeutics, if approved, together with other medications;\n\u2022publicity concerning our testing products and promoted therapeutics or competing products and treatments;\n\u2022the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors, including government authorities;\n\u2022relative convenience and ease of administration; and\n\u2022the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts.\nIn addition, if we or our partners had to withdraw a product from the market, it could harm our business and could impact market acceptance of our other testing products or promoted therapeutics. Further, our AVISE\u00ae CTD consists of various biomarkers, any of which could independently encounter issues with manufacturing, supply or overall quality. If any of the biomarkers in our AVISE\u00ae CTD test were to encounter any issues, we may experience an impact in the overall success of AVISE\u00ae CTD as a whole, including a reduction in average selling price or overall revenue, until such time as it can be remedied. Moreover, if our testing products and promoted therapeutics do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by rheumatologists, hospitals, third-party payors or patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue from that testing product or therapeutic and may not become or remain profitable. Our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors regarding the benefits of our testing products and promoted therapeutics may require significant resources and may never be successful.\nThe sizes of the markets for our testing products and promoted therapeutics have not been established with precision, and may be smaller than we estimate.\nOur estimates of the annual total addressable markets for our current and potential future testing products and promoted therapeutics are based on a number of internal and third-party estimates. These include, without limitation, the number of patients with autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases and the assumed prices at which we can sell testing products and our partners can sell therapeutics in markets that have not been established. While we believe our assumptions and the data underlying our estimates are reasonable, these assumptions and estimates may not be correct and the conditions supporting our assumptions or estimates may change at any time, thereby reducing the predictive accuracy of these underlying factors. As a result, our estimates of the annual total addressable market for our current and potential future testing products and promoted therapeutics may prove to be incorrect. If the actual number of patients who would benefit from our testing products and promoted therapeutics, the price at which we and our partners can sell future testing products, or the annual total addressable market for our testing products and promoted therapeutics is smaller than we have estimated, it may impair our sales growth and have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular testing product or promoted therapeutic and fail to capitalize on other testing products or promoted therapeutics that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on specific testing products and promoted therapeutics. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with others that could have had greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. In addition, our spending on current and future research and development programs for testing products may not yield any commercially viable testing products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a potential testing product or promoted therapeutic, we may forego other similar arrangements which would have been more advantageous for us to pursue.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or any guidance we may provide.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. These fluctuations may occur due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022our ability to successfully market and sell our AVISE\u00ae testing products and continue to promote SIMPONI\u00ae;\n\u2022the extent to which our current testing and future testing products, if any, are eligible for coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors;\n\u2022public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022the timing and cost of, and level of investment in, research, development, regulatory approval and commercialization activities relating to our testing products, which may change from time to time, and our ability to successfully commercialize new testing products;\n\u2022the cost of supplies, equipment and materials used for our testing products and laboratory operations, which may vary depending on the quantity of production and the terms of our agreements with third-party suppliers and manufacturers;\n\u2022expenditures that we may incur to acquire, develop or commercialize additional testing products and technologies;\n\u2022the level of demand for our testing products and promoted therapeutics, which may vary significantly;\n\u2022the receipt, timing and mix of revenue for our testing products and promoted therapeutics;\n\u2022future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies;\n\u2022the rate and extent to which payors make an overpayment determination and require us to return all or some portion of payments which we received in a prior period; and\n\u2022the timing and success or failure of competing products, or any other change in the competitive landscape of our industry, including consolidation among our competitors or partners.\nThe cumulative effects of these factors could result in large fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and annual operating results. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Investors should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance.\nThis variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts we may provide to the market, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results or operations.\nWe rely on sole suppliers for some of the reagents, equipment and other materials used in our testing products, and we may not be able to find replacements or transition to alternative suppliers.\nWe rely on sole suppliers for critical supply of reagents, equipment and other materials that we use to perform the tests that comprise our testing products. We also purchase components used in our testing product transportation kits from sole-source suppliers. Some of these items are unique to these suppliers and vendors. While we have developed alternate sourcing strategies for many of these materials and vendors, we cannot be certain whether these strategies will be effective or the alternative sources will be available when we need them. We are not a major customer of some of our suppliers, and these suppliers may therefore give other customers\u2019 needs higher priority than ours. If our suppliers can no longer provide us with the materials we need to perform the tests that comprise our testing products, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, if the materials do not meet our quality specifications, or if we cannot obtain acceptable substitute materials, an interruption in test processing could occur and, in certain circumstances, we may be required to amend or cancel test results we have issued. For example, in November 2019, we identified a potential quality issue with reagents for Anti-CarP, a biomarker that can be ordered with our AVISE\u00ae CTD test, that was resolved in September 2020. However, if we are unable to remedy future potential quality issues with unique reagent suppliers, or otherwise find a supplier for future biomarkers with issues, we may experience difficulties obtaining market acceptance for our products. Moreover, any issues with quality may result in a change from time to time of the composition of our tests, including our AVISE\u00ae CTD test, which could impact the average selling price and revenues received from sales of such test.\nIn addition, if we should encounter delays or difficulties in securing the quality and quantity of equipment we require for our testing products, we may need to reconfigure our test processes, which could result in an interruption in sales. Any such interruption may significantly affect our future revenue and harm our customer relations and reputation. In addition, in order to mitigate these risks, we may need to maintain inventories of these supplies at higher levels than would be the case if multiple sources of supply were available.\nIf we are unable to support demand for our current testing products or any of our future testing products or solutions, our business could suffer.\nIf demand for our testing products or any of our future testing products or solutions grows, we will need to continue to scale our testing capacity and processing technology, expand customer service, billing and systems processes and enhance our internal quality assurance program. We may also need additional certified laboratory scientists and other scientific and technical personnel to process higher volumes of our testing products. We cannot assure you that any increases in scale, related improvements and quality assurance will be successfully implemented or that appropriate personnel will be available. We will also need to purchase additional equipment, some of which can take several months or more to procure, setup and validate, and increase our software and computing capacity to meet increased demand. Failure to implement necessary procedures, transition to new processes, hire the necessary personnel, obtain any necessary additional equipment and increase software and computing capacity could result in higher costs of processing tests or inability to meet demand. There can be no assurance that we will be able to perform our testing on a timely basis at a level consistent with demand, or that our efforts to scale our operations, expand our personnel, equipment, software and computing capacities, or implement process enhancements will be successfully implemented and will not negatively affect the quality of test results. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will have adequate space in our laboratory facility to accommodate such required expansion. We are also currently collaborating with third parties in an effort to implement multiplex technology in our laboratory. We may experience difficulties securing a partner for this technology and integrating such technology into our existing laboratory operations, which could affect our ability to meet demand for our testing\nproducts. If we encounter difficulty meeting market demand or quality standards, our reputation could be harmed and our future prospects and our business could suffer.\nIf third-party payors do not provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for our testing products, or they breach, rescind or modify their contracts or reimbursement policies or delay payments for our testing products or promoted therapeutics, or if we or our partners are unable to successfully negotiate payor contracts, our commercial success could be compromised.\nSuccessful commercialization of our testing products depends, in large part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including government payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid and private insurers. For the testing products that we develop and commercialize as well as the therapeutics we promote, each third-party payor decides whether to cover the product, the amount it will reimburse for a covered product and the specific conditions for reimbursement.\nReimbursement by third-party payors may depend on a number of factors, including the payor\u2019s determination that tests using our technologies are:\n\u2022not experimental or investigational;\n\u2022medically necessary;\n\u2022demonstrated lead to improved patient outcomes;\n\u2022appropriate for the specific patient;\n\u2022cost-saving or cost-effective;\n\u2022supported by peer-reviewed medical journals; and\n\u2022included in clinical guidelines.\nIf we are unable to provide third-party payors with sufficient evidence of the clinical utility and validity of our test, they may not provide coverage, or may provide limited coverage, which will adversely affect our revenue and our ability to succeed. In addition, clinicians may be less likely to order a test unless third-party payors pay a substantial portion of the test price. Therefore, coverage determinations and reimbursement levels and conditions are critical to commercial success, and if we are not able to secure positive coverage determinations and reimbursement levels, our business will be materially adversely affected. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic may cause a delay in coverage decisions from Medicare and third-party payors, and have delayed ongoing and planned clinical trials involving our testing products, the occurrence of which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThird-party payors and other entities also conduct technology assessments of new medical tests and devices and provide and/or sell the results of their assessments to other parties. These assessments may be used by third-party payors and health care providers as grounds to deny coverage for or refuse to use a test or procedure. In addition, third-party payors, have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services. These measures have resulted in reduced payment rates and decreased utilization for the diagnostics industry.\nEffective April 25, 2012, Palmetto GBA, the Medicare molecular diagnostic services program, or MolDx Program, contractor, assigned the AVISE\u00ae MTX assay a unique identifier and determined that the test meets the applicable Medicare coverage criteria to support dose optimization and therapeutic decision making for patients diagnosed with RA on methotrexate. Our current Medicare Administrative Contractor, Noridian Healthcare Solutions, LLC, or Noridian, has adopted this coverage policy. Other third-party payors make their own decisions as to whether to establish a policy to reimburse our testing products, however, and because approvals must be sought on a payor by payor basis, establishing broad coverage is a time-consuming and costly process. There are many third-party payors who have not yet established a coverage policy applicable to our testing products. In addition, several Blue Cross Blue Shield plans and Aetna issued non-coverage policies with respect to AVISE\u00ae Lupus, determining that AVISE\u00ae Lupus does not meet the medical criteria for coverage and is considered investigational and/or experimental.\nWhile our testing products are reimbursed by a number of third-party payors, we do not currently have contracts with significant private payors. We have in the past, and will likely in the future, experience delays and temporary interruptions in the receipt of payments from third-party payors due to changes in their internal processes, documentation requirements and other issues, which could cause our revenue to fluctuate from period to period.\nIf we are not successful in reversing existing non-coverage policies, or if other third-party payors issue negative coverage policies, these policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. Even if many third-party payors currently reimburse for our testing products, such payors may withdraw coverage at any time, review and adjust the rate of reimbursement, require co-payments from patients or stop paying for our testing products altogether, any of which would reduce our revenue.\nBilling for our testing products is complex, and we must dedicate substantial time and resources to the billing process to be paid for our testing products.\nBilling for our testing products is complex, time consuming and expensive. Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, we bill various third-party payors, including Medicare and private insurance companies, as well as patients, all of which have different billing requirements. We generally bill third-party payors for our testing products and pursue reimbursement on a case-by-case basis where pricing contracts are not in place. We may also face increased risk in our collection efforts, including long collection cycles and potential delays in claims processing, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSeveral factors contribute to the complexity of the billing process, including:\n\u2022differences between the list price for our testing products and the reimbursement rates of third-party payors;\n\u2022compliance with complex federal and state regulations related to billing Medicare;\n\u2022disputes among third-party payors as to which party is responsible for payment;\n\u2022differences in coverage among third-party payors;\n\u2022the effect of patient deductibles, co-payments or co-insurance;\n\u2022differences in information and billing requirements among third-party payors;\n\u2022changes to billing codes used for our testing products;\n\u2022risk of government audits related to billing;\n\u2022incorrect or missing billing information; and\n\u2022the resources required to manage the billing and claims appeals process.\nWe use standard industry billing codes, known as CPT codes, to bill for our testing products. If these codes were to change, there is a risk of an error being made in the claim adjudication process. Such errors can occur with claims submission, third-party transmission or in the processing of the claim by the payor. Claim adjudication errors may result in a delay in payment processing or a reduction in the amount of the payment received.\nAs we introduce new testing products, we will need to add new codes to our billing process as well as our financial reporting systems. Failure or delays in effecting these changes in external billing and internal systems and processes could negatively affect our collection rates, revenue and cost of collecting.\nOur billing activities require us to implement compliance procedures and oversight, train and monitor our employees, and undertake internal audits to evaluate compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures. When payors deny our claims, in order to obtain reimbursement for services that we provide, we may challenge coverage and payment denials. Payors also conduct external audits to evaluate payments, which add further complexity to the billing process. If the payor makes an overpayment determination, there is a risk that we may be required to return all or some portion of prior payments we have received. Additionally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, established a requirement for providers and suppliers to report and return any overpayments received from government payors under the Medicare and Medicaid programs within 60 days of identification. Failure to identify and return such overpayments exposes the provider or supplier to liability under federal false claims laws.\nAdditionally, from time to time, third-party payors change processes that may affect timely payment. These changes may result in uneven cash flow or impact the timing of revenue recognized with these payors. With respect to payments received from governmental programs, factors such as a prolonged government shutdown could cause significant regulatory delays or could result in attempts to reduce payments made to us by federal government healthcare programs. In addition, third-party payors may refuse to ultimately make payment if their processes and requirements have not been met on a timely basis. These billing complexities, and the related uncertainty in obtaining payment for our testing products could negatively affect our revenue and cash flow, our ability to achieve profitability, and the consistency and comparability of our results of operations.\nIn 2020, Noridian posted the calendar year 2021 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, or MPFS, and Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS, which establishes the reimbursement rates to be paid by Medicare for our jurisdiction for services performed on or after January 1, 2021. We have estimated that the implementation of these reimbursement rates will not result in a reduction in anticipated reimbursements from Medicare for our AVISE\u00ae CTD testing product compared to levels experienced in 2020. On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act included the temporary suspension of Medicare sequestration of 2% during the period beginning on May 1, 2020 and ending on December 31, 2020. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, signed into law on December 27, 2020, extends the suspension period to March 31, 2021. Revenue from Medicare comprised 20% and 25% of our revenue for the\nyears ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Revenue from the sale of our AVISE\u00ae CTD testing products comprised 70% and 82% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe also rely on a third-party provider to provide revenue cycle management software systems for certain processing and collection functions. In the past, we have experienced delays in claims processing as a result of our third-party provider making changes to its invoicing system, as well as not submitting claims to payors within the timeframe required. If claims for our testing products are not submitted to payors on a timely basis, or if we are required to switch to a different systems provider, it could have an adverse effect on our revenue and our business.\nOur reliance on third parties requires us to share our trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed.\nAt times, we share our proprietary technology and confidential information, including trade secrets, with third parties that conduct studies and other services on our behalf. We seek to protect our proprietary technology, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements, consulting agreements or other similar agreements with our advisors, employees and consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information. Despite the contractual provisions employed when working with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are intentionally or inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our know-how and trade secrets and despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets, a competitor\u2019s discovery of our proprietary technology and confidential information or other unauthorized use or disclosure would impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nSignificant safety or efficacy issues could arise for our promoted therapeutics, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue and financial condition.\nPharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safety or efficacy issues are reported or if new scientific information becomes available (including results of post-marketing Phase 4 trials), or if governments change standards regarding safety, efficacy or labeling, our partners may be required to amend the conditions of use for a therapeutic. For example, a partner may voluntarily provide or be required to provide updated information on a therapeutics' label or narrow its approved indication, either of which could reduce the therapeutics' market acceptance. If safety or efficacy issues with a partner\u2019s therapeutic arise, sales of the therapeutic could be halted by the partner or by regulatory authorities. Safety or efficacy issues affecting suppliers\u2019 or competitors\u2019 products also may reduce the market acceptance of one of our partner\u2019s therapeutics.\nNew data about a partner\u2019s therapeutics, or products similar to a partner\u2019s therapeutics, could negatively impact demand for such therapeutics due to real or perceived safety issues or uncertainty regarding efficacy and, in some cases, could result in product withdrawal. Furthermore, new data and information, including information about therapeutic misuse, may lead government agencies, professional societies, practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of such therapeutics or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales. Such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of the applicable therapeutics and reduce our revenue or otherwise adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.\nIf we are unable to maintain or expand our sales and marketing force to adequately address our customers\u2019 and current or future partners\u2019 needs, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe sell our testing products through our own specialized salesforce and have increased our salesforce in order to achieve the optimal reach and frequency and support our strategy of integrating the promotion of testing products and therapeutics. Our testing products compete in a concentrated specialty market, that of autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases, and utilizing a specialized salesforce is integral to our integrated testing and therapeutics strategy. As such, we believe it is necessary to maintain a salesforce that includes sales representatives with specific technical backgrounds and industry expertise. For example, we have a salesforce of 53 representatives as of December 31, 2020, and expect to continue to expand our salesforce in 2021. Additional agreements for the promotion of therapeutics may require us to further expand our specialized salesforce. Training of additional sales representatives can be costly and time consuming, particularly given the level of experience and sophistication we seek in our salesforce. In addition, until recently, not all of our sales representatives have promoted therapeutics, including SIMPONI\u00ae, as part of our organization, and they will need to complete additional\ntraining in order to effectively promote SIMPONI\u00ae and any other therapeutics that we promote through additional agreements. If we are unable to effectively retain, train and integrate additional sales representatives, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively market and sell our testing products. In addition, competition for highly specialized sales personnel is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain personnel or be able to maintain an efficient and effective sales and marketing force.\nOur future sales will depend in large part on our ability to maintain an effective salesforce. If we are unsuccessful in this regard, it could negatively impact our revenue growth and potential profitability.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully, we may be unable to increase or sustain our revenue or achieve profitability.\nOur principal competition for our testing products is traditional methods used by healthcare providers to test patients with CTD-like symptoms. Such traditional methods include testing for a broad range of diagnostic, immunology and chemistry biomarkers, such as anti-nuclear antibodies, or ANA, and anti-double-stranded DNA, or anti-dsDNA, and serum complement biomarkers, such as C3 and C4. We also face competition from commercial laboratories, such as Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, Quest Diagnostics Incorporated, ARUP Laboratories, Inc. and the Mayo Clinic, all of which have existing infrastructures to support the commercialization of diagnostic services. Large, multispecialty group medical clinics, health systems and academic medical university-based clinics may provide in-house clinical laboratories offering autoimmune and autoimmune-related disease testing services. Additionally, we compete against regional clinical laboratories providing testing in the autoimmune and autoimmune-related disease field, including Rheumatology Diagnostics Laboratories, Inc. (acquired by Laboratory Corporation of America in June 2020). Other potential competitors include companies that might develop diagnostic or disease or drug monitoring products, such as Myriad Genetics, Inc., Progentec Diagnostics Inc., Scipher Medicine Corporation, Genalyte Inc., Oncimmune plc, DxTerity Diagnostics Inc., and Immunovia AB. In the future, we may also face competition from companies developing new products or technologies.\nDirect competition for the promotion of SIMPONI\u00ae includes all other companies with anti-TNF biologics and the marketing companies supporting their distribution and promotion. These products include HUMIRA\u00ae from Abbvie Inc., ENBREL\u00ae from Amgen Inc., CIMZIA\u00ae from UCB, INFLECTRA\u00ae from Pfizer, (biosimilar REMICADE\u00ae) and RENFLEXIS\u00ae from Merck & Co. (biosimilar REMICADE\u00ae). Additionally, we are restricted from promoting any other biologic or Janus kinase inhibitor, or JAK inhibitor, used for treatment of indications covered by the Janssen Agreement without Janssen's consent. Additional competitors include companies with other biologic drugs indicated for RA that have significant sales or sales potential. Specifically, these include ORENCIA\u00ae from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, ACTEMRA\u00ae from Roche, RITUXAN\u00ae from Roche, XELJANZ\u00ae from Pfizer, KEVZARA\u00ae from Sanofi S.A., RINVOQ\u2122 from Abbvie Inc. and OLUMIANT\u00ae from Eli Lilly and Company. There are also several late-stage RA drug and biosimilar development programs and several additional RA products that have minimal sales to date or that are indicated for other rheumatic indications competitive to SIMPONI\u00ae such as psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.\nWe believe the principal competitive factors in our target market include: quality and strength of clinical and analytical validation data; confidence in diagnostic results; safety and efficacy with respect to promoted therapeutics; sales and marketing capabilities; the extent of reimbursement; inclusion in clinical guidelines; cost-effectiveness; and ease of use.\nMany of our potential competitors have widespread brand recognition and substantially greater financial, technical and research and development resources and selling and marketing capabilities than we do. Others may develop products with prices lower than ours that could be viewed by rheumatologists and payors as functionally equivalent to our solution or offer solutions at prices designed to promote market penetration, which could force us to lower the list price of our products and affect our ability to achieve profitability. If we are unable to change clinical practice in a meaningful way or compete successfully against current and future competitors, we may be unable to increase market acceptance and sales of our products, which could prevent us from increasing our revenue or achieving profitability and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nTo compete successfully we must be able to demonstrate, among other things, that our testing products are accurate and cost effective and that we are effective in promoting therapeutics.\nDeveloping new testing products involves a lengthy and complex process, and we may not be able to commercialize on a timely basis, or at all, other testing products we are developing.\nWe will continue to devote considerable resources to the research and development of our planned future testing products and enhancements to our current testing products. We may not be able to develop testing products with the clinical utility necessary to be useful and commercially successful. There are certain products for which a\ncommercial launch would trigger additional payment obligations to licensors of the technology. In these cases, if the economic projections of the product do not outweigh the additional obligations, we may not launch these products. In order to develop and commercialize testing products, we need to:\n\u2022expend significant funds to conduct substantial research and development;\n\u2022conduct successful validation studies;\n\u2022develop and scale our laboratory processes to accommodate different tests;\n\u2022achieve and maintain required regulatory certifications;\n\u2022develop and scale our infrastructure to be able to analyze increasingly large amounts of data; and\n\u2022build the commercial infrastructure to market and sell new testing products.\nOur testing product development process involves a high degree of risk and may take several years. Our testing product development efforts may fail for many reasons, including:\n\u2022failure to identify additional biomarkers to incorporate into our testing products;\n\u2022failure or sub-optimal performance of the testing product at the research or development stage;\n\u2022difficulty in accessing archival patient blood specimens, especially specimens with known clinical results; or\n\u2022failure of clinical validation studies to support the effectiveness of the test.\nTypically, few research and development projects result in commercial products, and success in early clinical studies often is not replicated in later studies. At any point, we may abandon development of a testing product candidate or we may be required to expend considerable resources repeating clinical studies, which would adversely affect the timing for generating potential revenue from a new testing product and our ability to invest in other products in our pipeline. In addition, as we develop testing products, we will have to make significant investments in product development, marketing and selling resources. If a clinical validation study fails to demonstrate the prospectively defined endpoints of the study, we might choose to abandon the development of the testing product or product feature that was the subject of the clinical study, which could harm our business. Additionally, competitors may develop and commercialize competing products or technologies faster than us or at a lower cost.\nDeveloping new testing products and enhancements to our existing technologies is expensive and time consuming, and there is no assurance that such activities will result in significant new marketable testing products, enhancements to our current technologies, design improvements, cost savings, revenue or other expected benefits. If we spend significant resources on research and development and are unable to generate an adequate return on our investment or divert resources away from other, more attractive growth opportunities, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we cannot enter into new clinical study collaborations, our product development and subsequent commercialization could be delayed.\nIn the past, we have entered into clinical study collaborations, and our success in the future depends in part on our ability to enter into additional collaborations with highly regarded institutions. This can be difficult due to internal and external constraints placed on these organizations. Some organizations may limit the number of collaborations they have with any one company so as to not be perceived as biased or conflicted. Organizations may also have insufficient administrative and related infrastructure to enable collaborations with many companies at once, which can extend the time it takes to develop, negotiate and implement a collaboration. Additionally, organizations often insist on retaining the rights to publish the clinical data resulting from the collaboration. The publication of clinical data in peer-reviewed medical journals is a crucial step in commercializing and obtaining reimbursement for testing products such as our testing products, and our inability to control when and if results are published may delay or limit our ability to derive sufficient revenue from any solution.\nWe may acquire businesses or assets, form joint ventures or make investments in other companies or technologies that could harm our operating results, dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses or assets, as well as technology licensing arrangements and other strategic transactions or collaborations with third parties. We also may pursue strategic alliances that leverage our core technology and industry experience to expand our offerings or distribution, make investments in other companies or acquire ownership rights to therapeutics that are synergistic with our testing products. To date, other than our acquisition of the medical diagnostics division of Cypress Bioscience, Inc. in 2010, we have not acquired other companies or therapeutics and, except with respect to certain collaboration agreements executed in connection with our integrated testing and therapeutics strategy, we have\nlimited experience with respect to the formation of strategic alliances and joint ventures. If we make any acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into our existing business, and we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities. Any future acquisitions by us also could result in significant write-offs or the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, any of which could harm our operating results. Integration of an acquired company, business or assets also may require management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our existing business. We may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, technology license, strategic alliance, joint venture or investment.\nTo finance any acquisitions or investments, we may choose to issue shares of our stock as consideration, which would dilute the ownership of our stockholders. If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other companies for stock. Alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds for these activities through public or private financings or through the issuance of debt. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all, and any debt financing may involve covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take certain actions.\nAlso, the anticipated benefit of any strategic alliance, joint venture or acquisition may not materialize or such strategic alliance, joint venture or acquisition may be prohibited. In addition, our loan agreement restricts our ability to pursue certain mergers, acquisitions, amalgamations or consolidations that we may believe to be in our best interest. Additionally, future acquisitions or dispositions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. We cannot predict the number, timing or size of future joint ventures or acquisitions, or the effect that any such transactions might have on our operating results.\nThe diagnostics and therapeutics industries are subject to rapidly changing technology, which could make our testing products, promoted therapeutics and other testing products we develop obsolete.\nOur industry is characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards. These advances require us to continuously develop our technology and work to develop new solutions to keep pace with evolving standards of care. Our testing products could become obsolete unless we continually innovate and expand our testing product offerings to include new clinical applications. If we are unable to develop new testing products or to demonstrate the applicability of our testing products for other diseases, our sales could decline and our competitive position could be harmed. In addition, if our promoted therapeutics become obsolete and we are unable to expand such agreements or find new partners, our sales could decline and our competitive position could be harmed. For example, with respect to SIMPONI\u00ae and the treatment of RA, active psoriatic arthritis, or active ankylosing spondylitis, there are many novel therapeutic approaches in development and we expect that the competition in this market will increase dramatically. If new therapeutics make SIMPONI\u00ae obsolete or diminish the degree to which rheumatologists prescribe it, our ability to generate revenue under the Janssen Agreement will be harmed.\nOur failure to maintain relationships or build new relationships with key opinion leaders could materially adversely impact our business and prospects.\nKey opinion leaders are able to influence clinical practice by publishing research and determining whether new tests should be integrated into clinical guidelines. We rely on key opinion leaders early in the development process to help ensure our clinical studies are designed and executed in a way that clearly demonstrates the benefits of our testing products to healthcare providers and payors. Our failure to maintain or build new relationships with such key opinion leaders could affect rheumatologist and patient perception of our testing products and result in a loss of existing and future customers and therefore materially adversely impact our business and prospects.\nIf we are sued for errors and omissions or professional liability, we could face substantial liabilities that exceed our resources.\nThe marketing, sale and use of our testing products could lead to liability claims if someone were to allege that any such testing product failed to perform as it was designed. We may also be subject to liability for errors in the results we provide to rheumatologists or for a misunderstanding of, or inappropriate reliance upon, the information we provide. We may also be subject to similar types of claims related to testing products we may develop in the future. Any errors or omissions or professional liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time consuming for us to defend. Although we maintain professional liability insurance, we cannot assure you that our insurance would fully protect us from the financial impact of defending against these types of claims or any judgments, fines or settlement costs arising out of any such claims. Any errors or omissions or professional liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our insurance rates or prevent us from securing\ninsurance coverage in the future. Additionally, any product liability lawsuit could cause injury to our reputation or cause us to suspend sales of our testing products. Similarly, any product liability lawsuit affecting our partners could also cause injury to our reputation or cause the applicable partner to suspend sales of its therapeutics. We may also initiate a correction or removal for one of our testing products, issue a safety alert or undertake a field action or recall to reduce a risk to health posed by potential failure of our products to perform as designed, which could lead increase costs and lead to increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities and our customers regarding the quality and safety of our testing products and to negative publicity, including safety alerts, press releases or administrative or judicial actions. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe loss of members of our senior management team or our inability to attract and retain highly skilled scientists, technicians and salespeople could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends largely on the skills, experience and performance of key members of our executive management team, including Fortunato Ron Rocca, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and others in key management positions. The efforts of each of these persons will be critical to us as we continue to develop our technologies and test processes and focus on our growth. If we were to lose one or more of these key employees, we may experience difficulties in competing effectively, developing our technologies and implementing our business strategy.\nIn addition, our research and development programs and commercial laboratory operations depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientists, including licensed clinical laboratory scientists and biostatisticians. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified scientists and technicians in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among life science businesses, particularly in Southern California. Because it is expected that there will be a shortage of clinical laboratory scientists in coming years, it may become more difficult to hire sufficient numbers of qualified personnel. We also face competition from universities and public and private research institutions in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel. Additionally, our success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified and highly-specialized salespeople. We may have difficulties locating, recruiting or retaining qualified salespeople, which could cause a delay or decline in the rate of adoption of our testing products and the sale of promoted therapeutics. If we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that could adversely affect our ability to support our research and development, clinical laboratory and sales efforts. All of our employees are at-will, which means that either we or the employee may terminate their employment at any time. Other than with respect to Mr. Rocca, we do not carry key man insurance for any of our employees.\nIf our sole laboratory facility becomes damaged or inoperable, we are required to vacate our existing facility or we are unable to expand our existing facility as needed, we will be unable to perform our testing services and our business will be harmed.\nWe currently derive all of our revenue from tests conducted at a single laboratory facility located in Vista, California. Vista is situated on or near earthquake fault lines. Our facility and equipment could be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including earthquake, fire, flood, power loss, communications failure or terrorism, or public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we store all of our flow cytometers, the instrument we use to detect CB-CAPs on cells, at our Vista facility. If all of our flow cytometers were rendered inoperable simultaneously pursuant to a natural or man-made disaster, we would be unable to perform these key tests as we do in the ordinary course of our business. The inability to perform the tests contained in our testing products or to reduce the backlog of analyses that could develop if our facility is inoperable, for even a short period of time, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in the loss of customers or harm to our reputation, and we may be unable to regain those customers or repair our reputation in the future. Additionally, we store our bio-repository of specimens, which were collected in collaboration with leading academic institutions and help us to further validate our testing products, at our Vista facility. If these specimens were destroyed pursuant to a natural or man-made disaster or otherwise become unavailable, our ability to develop new testing products may be delayed. Furthermore, our facility and the equipment we use to perform our research and development work could be unavailable or costly and time-consuming to repair or replace. It would be difficult, time-consuming and expensive to rebuild our facility or license or transfer our proprietary technology to a third party, particularly in light of the licensure and accreditation requirements for a commercial laboratory like ours. Even in the unlikely event we are able to find a third party with such qualifications to enable us to conduct the tests contained in our testing products, we may be unable to negotiate commercially reasonable terms.\nIn order to rely on a third party to perform the tests contained in our testing products, we would need to engage another facility with established state licensure and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, accreditation under the scope of which tests could be performed following validation and other required procedures.\nWe cannot assure you that we would be able to find another CLIA-certified facility willing to comply with the required procedures, that any such facility would be willing to perform the tests contained in our testing products for us on commercially reasonable terms, or that it would be able to meet our quality standards.\nIn order to establish an additional clinical reference laboratory facility, we would have to spend considerable time and money securing adequate space, constructing the facility, recruiting and training employees, and establishing the additional operational and administrative infrastructure necessary to support a second facility. We may not be able, or it may take considerable time, to replicate our testing processes or results in a new facility. Additionally, any new clinical reference laboratory facility opened by us would be subject to certification under CLIA and licensing by several states, including California and New York, which could take a significant amount of time and result in delays in our ability to begin operations.\nWe believe we have the capacity to meet our projected needs for at least the next 12 months, although we may grow at a rate that is faster than we expect. Beyond this time frame, we may need to further expand our laboratory space. Any future expansion could disrupt laboratory operations, resulting in an inability to meet customer turnaround time expectations, and could be delayed, resulting in slower realization of laboratory efficiencies anticipated from the use of the expanded facilities. Adverse consequences resulting from a delay in the laboratory expansion could harm our relationships with our customers and our reputation, and could affect our ability to generate revenue.\nWe carry insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business, but this insurance may not cover all of the risks associated with damage or disruption to our business, provide coverage in amounts sufficient to cover our potential losses or continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nOur testing process involves the use of sophisticated state-of-the-art equipment that requires precise calibration, and issues affecting such equipment may delay delivery or impact the quality of the test results to rheumatologists or otherwise adversely affect our operations.\nAs part of our process of determining CB-CAPs, which is part of our AVISE\u00ae Lupus product, we utilize a number of flow cytometers that require calibration and performance validation according to the requirements of the College of American Pathologists, or CAP, at specified time intervals. While we believe we have implemented appropriate controls and metrics in our laboratory to meet such requirements, we cannot provide any assurance that our instruments will not fall out of specification, in which case we would be required to re-calibrate them. Failure to timely re-calibrate our instruments could negatively impact the test results, which could result in liability and harm our reputation. Patient specimens degrade and become unusable generally within 48 hours of collection. Therefore, if we do not have other sufficient properly functioning flow cytometers due to failure to meet specifications or they otherwise become inoperable, our ability to process patient specimens in the required timeframe would be compromised and our business could be harmed.\nFailure in our information technology, telephone or other systems could significantly disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nInformation technology and telephone systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business, including laboratory testing, sales, billing, customer service, logistics and management of medical data. The success of our business depends on the ability to obtain, process, analyze, maintain and manage this data. Our management relies on our information systems because:\n\u2022patient specimens must be received, tracked and processed on a timely basis;\n\u2022test results must be reported on a timely basis;\n\u2022billings and collections for all customers must be managed efficiently and accurately;\n\u2022third-party ancillary billing services require proper tracking and reporting;\n\u2022pricing and other information related to our services is needed by our salesforce and other personnel in a timely manner to conduct business;\n\u2022patient-identifiable health information must be securely held and kept confidential;\n\u2022regulatory compliance requires proper tracking and reporting; and\n\u2022proper recordkeeping is required for operating our business, managing employee compensation and other personnel matters.\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if, among other things:\n\u2022our information technology, telephone or other systems fail or are interrupted for any extended length of time;\n\u2022services relating to our information technology, telephone or other systems are not kept current;\n\u2022our information technology, telephone or other systems do not have the capacity to support expanded operations and increased levels of business;\n\u2022data is lost or unable to be restored or processed; or\n\u2022data is corrupted due to a breach of security.\nDespite the precautionary measures we have taken to prevent breakdowns in our information technology, telephone and other systems, sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to process test orders, deliver test results or perform testing in a timely manner or that cause us to inadvertently disclose or lose patient information could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSecurity breaches, loss of data and other disruptions to us, our third-party service providers or our partners could compromise sensitive information related to our business or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we and our partners, and our respective third-party service providers collect and store sensitive data, such as legally protected health information, including de-identified test reports, personally identifiable information about our patients, credit card information, intellectual property, and our proprietary business and financial information. We manage and maintain our applications and data utilizing a combination of on-site and vendor-owned systems. We face a number of risks related to our protection of, and our service providers\u2019 protection of, this critical information, including loss of access, unauthorized disclosure and unauthorized access, as well as risks associated with our ability to identify and audit such events. In addition, we have limited control over the storage of sensitive data by our third-party therapeutics partners as well as risks related to the transfer and sale of de-identified data files to such partners.\nThe secure processing, storage, maintenance and transmission of this critical information is vital to our operations and business strategy, and we devote significant resources to protecting such information. Although we take measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure, and that of our third-party billing and collections provider, may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or viruses or otherwise breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other activities. Attacks upon information technology systems are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. Additionally, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, most of our employees are working remotely, which may increase the risk of security breaches, loss of data, and other disruptions as a consequence of more employees accessing sensitive and critical information from remote locations. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. We may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period. While we do not believe that we have experienced any such attack or breach, if such an event were to occur, our networks would be compromised and the information we store on those networks could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, such as HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, and their implementing regulations and regulatory penalties. Unauthorized access, loss or dissemination could also disrupt our operations, including our ability to process tests, provide test results, bill payors or patients, process claims and appeals, provide customer assistance services, conduct research and development activities, collect, process and prepare company financial information, provide information about our products and other patient and rheumatologist education and outreach efforts through our website and manage the administrative aspects of our business and could damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, the interpretation and application of federal and state consumer, health-related and data protection laws in the United States are often uncertain, contradictory and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. If so, this could result in government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our practices, which could adversely affect our business. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices, systems and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business. Additionally, in connection with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, most of our employees are working remotely, which may increase the risk of security breaches, loss of data, and other disruptions as a consequence of more employees accessing sensitive and critical information from remote locations.\nPerformance issues, service interruptions or price increases by our shipping carrier could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, and harm our reputation and ability to provide testing services on a timely basis.\nExpedited, reliable shipping is essential to our operations. We have been utilizing both United Parcel Service and Federal Express Corporation for reliable and secure point-to-point transport of patient specimens to our laboratory and enhanced tracking of these patient specimens. Should Federal Express, United Parcel Service, or any other carrier we may use in the future, encounter delivery performance issues such as loss, damage or destruction of a specimen, it may be difficult to replace our patient specimens in a timely manner and such occurrences may damage our reputation and lead to decreased utilization from rheumatologists for our testing services and increased cost and expense to our business. In addition, any significant increase in shipping time or disruption to delivery service, whether due to bad weather, natural disaster, public health epidemics or pandemics (including, for example, the COVID-19 pandemic), terrorist attacks or threats, or for other reasons, could adversely affect our ability to receive and process patient specimens on a timely basis.\nIf we, Federal Express, or United Parcel Service were to terminate our relationship, we would be required to find another party to provide expedited, reliable point-to-point transport of our patient specimens. There are only a few other providers of such nationwide transport services, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into arrangements with such other providers on acceptable terms, if at all. Finding a new provider of transport services would be time-consuming and costly and result in delays in our ability to provide our testing services. Even if we were to enter into an arrangement with any such provider, there can be no assurance that they will provide the same level of quality in transport services currently provided to us by Federal Express and United Parcel Service. If any new provider does not provide, or if Federal Express or United Parcel Service does not continue to provide, the required quality and reliability of transport services at the same or similar costs, it could adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage-point change (by value) in its equity ownership by \u201c5-percent shareholders,\u201d as defined in the Code, over a rolling three-year period), the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change federal taxable income and taxes, as applicable, may be limited. We previously completed a study to assess whether an ownership change, as defined by Section 382 of the Code, had occurred from our formation through December 31, 2019. Based upon this study, we determined that ownership changes had occurred in 2003, 2008, 2012, 2017 and 2019, and that our ability to use a significant portion of our NOL carryforwards is subject to limitation under Section 382 of the Code as a result of a prior ownership change. If we undergo an ownership change as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes could be further limited by Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply. In addition, federal NOL carryforwards generated in periods after December 31, 2017, may be carried forward indefinitely but, in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020, may only be used to offset 80% of our taxable income. As a result of the foregoing, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset taxable income and taxes, as applicable, may be limited.\nRecent U.S. tax legislation may materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRecently enacted U.S. tax legislation, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations, including by reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate and revising the rules governing NOLs. Many of these changes are effective immediately, without any transition periods or grandfathering for existing transactions. The legislation is unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the U.S. Treasury and U.S. Internal Revenue Service, any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation. In addition, it is unclear how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities. Based on our current evaluation of this legislation, the reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate required a provisional write-down of our deferred income tax assets (including the value of our NOL carryforwards and our tax credit carryforwards).\nThere may be other material adverse effects resulting from the legislation that we have not yet identified. While some of the changes made by the tax legislation may adversely affect us in one or more reporting periods and\nprospectively, other changes may be beneficial on a going forward basis. We continue to work with our tax advisors to determine the full impact that the recent tax legislation as a whole will have on us. We urge our investors to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to such legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in our common stock.\nOur term loan contains restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business, and if we fail to comply with the covenants and other obligations under our loan agreement, the lenders may be able to accelerate amounts owed under the facility and may foreclose upon the assets securing our obligations.\nIn September 2017, we entered into the loan and security agreement with Innovatus Life Sciences Lending Fund I, LP, or Innovatus, which we subsequently amended in November 2019, or the Amended Loan Agreement. The Amended Loan Agreement is collateralized by substantially all of our personal property, including our intellectual property. The Amended Loan Agreement also subjects us to certain affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on our ability to transfer or dispose of assets, merge with or acquire other companies, make investments, pay dividends, incur additional indebtedness and liens and conduct transactions with affiliates. We are also subject to certain covenants that require us to maintain a minimum liquidity of at least $2.0 million and achieve certain minimum amounts of annual revenue, as measured on a rolling twelve-month basis, and are required under certain conditions to make mandatory prepayments of outstanding principal. As a result of these covenants, we have certain limitations on the manner in which we can conduct our business, and we may be restricted from engaging in favorable business activities or financing future operations or capital needs until our current debt obligations are paid in full or we obtain the consent of Innovatus, which we may not be able to obtain. As of December 31, 2020, there was $25.0 million in principal outstanding under the term loan and an additional $1.8 million outstanding representing interest at 2.0% per annum payable in-kind by adding the amount to the outstanding principal balance of the term loans. Under the Amended Loan Agreement, we are required to repay any outstanding principal and capitalized interest in monthly installments over a two-year period commencing on December 1, 2022. Our revenues for the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2020 were lower than the specified targets in the Amended Loan Agreement, and as a result, we and Innovatus agreed on a new management plan and target to bring us back into compliance with the Amended Loan Agreement. At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all covenants of the Amended Loan Agreement. We cannot be certain that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow or revenue to meet the financial covenants or pay the principal and accrued interest on our debt.\nIn addition, upon the occurrence of an event of default, Innovatus, among other things, can declare all indebtedness due and payable immediately, which would adversely impact our liquidity and reduce the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. An event of default includes, but is not limited to, our failure to pay any amount due and payable under the Amended Loan Agreement, the occurrence of a material adverse change in our business as defined in the Amended Loan Agreement, our breach of any representation or warranty in the Amended Loan Agreement, our breach of any covenant in the Amended Loan Agreement (subject to a cure period in some cases), a change in control as defined in the Amended Loan Agreement, our default on any debt payments to a third party in an amount exceeding $500,000 or any voluntary or involuntary insolvency proceeding. If an event of default occurs and we are unable to repay amounts due under the Amended Loan Agreement, Innovatus could foreclose on substantially all of our personal property, including our intellectual property. We cannot be certain that future working capital, borrowings or equity financings will be available to repay or refinance our debt to Innovatus or any other debt we may incur in the future.\nWe may require substantial additional capital to finance our planned operations, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our failure to obtain additional financing when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce or eliminate our product development programs, commercialization efforts or other operations.\nWe expect capital expenditures and operating expenses to increase over the next several years as we expand our infrastructure, commercial operations and research and development activities. We believe, based on our current plan, that our current cash and cash equivalents and anticipated future revenue, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our operating plans and other demands on our cash resources may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, such as strategic collaborations. If our available cash balances and anticipated future revenue are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, including because of lower demand for our testing products or promoted therapeutics or lower-than-expected rates of reimbursement from commercial third-party payors and government payors, or other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, we may seek to raise additional capital through equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations or licensing arrangements. In the case of the incurrence of further indebtedness, the Amended Loan Agreement, subject to\ncertain customary exceptions, restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness or encumber any of our property without the prior consent of Innovatus. Under the Amended Loan Agreement, we are required to make monthly interest payments at a rate equal to 8.5% (provided that 2.0% of the 8.5% is payable in-kind by adding the amount to the outstanding principal balance of the term loans). We may also consider raising additional capital in the future to expand our business, pursue strategic investments, take advantage of financing opportunities, or for other reasons. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations, even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. The timing and amounts of our future capital requirements are difficult to forecast and will depend on numerous factors, including: our ability to maintain and grow sales of our testing products, as well as the costs associated with conducting clinical studies to demonstrate the utility of our testing products and support reimbursement efforts; our ability to successfully promote therapeutics; fluctuations in working capital; the costs to expand our sales and marketing capabilities; the costs of developing our product pipeline, including the costs associated with conducting our ongoing and future validation studies; the additional costs we may incur as a result of operating as a public company and the extent to which we in-license, acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products.\nAdditional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to our stockholders could result, and the market price of our common stock could decline. Any equity securities issued also may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. The incurrence of additional indebtedness or the issuance of certain equity securities could result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or issue additional equity, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights, and other operating restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. In addition, our Amended Loan Agreement restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness or encumber any of our property without the prior consent of Innovatus, subject to certain exceptions. In the event that we enter into collaborations or licensing arrangements to raise capital, we may be required to accept unfavorable terms. These agreements may require that we relinquish or license to a third party on unfavorable terms our rights to technologies or product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves, or reserve certain opportunities for future potential arrangements when we might be able to achieve more favorable terms. If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more research and development programs or selling and marketing initiatives. In addition, we may have to work with a partner on one or more of our testing products, promoted therapeutics or market development programs, which could lower the economic value of those programs to our company.\nThe FDA may modify its enforcement discretion policy with respect to LDTs in a risk-based manner, and we may become subject to extensive regulatory requirements and may be required to conduct additional clinical trials prior to continuing to sell our existing tests or launching any other tests we may develop, which may increase the cost of conducting, or otherwise harm, our business.\nWe currently market our in vitro diagnostic testing products in the United States as LDTs. LDTs are in vitro diagnostic tests that are intended for clinical use and are designed, manufactured, and used within a single laboratory. Although LDTs are classified as medical devices and the FDA has statutory authority to ensure that medical devices are safe and effective for their intended uses, the FDA has historically exercised enforcement discretion and has not enforced certain applicable FDA requirements, including premarket review, with respect to LDTs. Moreover, in August 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, announced that FDA will not require premarket review of LDTs absent notice-and-comment rulemaking.\nLegislative and administrative proposals proposing to amend the FDA\u2019s oversight of LDTs have been introduced in recent years and we expect that new legislative and administrative proposals will continue to be introduced from time to time. It is possible that legislation could be enacted into law or regulations or guidance could be issued by the FDA which may result in new or increased regulatory requirements for us to continue to offer our LDTs or to develop and introduce new tests as LDTs.\nFor example, the FDA could modify its current approach to LDTs in a way that would subject our tests that we market as LDTs to the enforcement of additional regulatory requirements. In recent years, the FDA has stated its intention to modify its enforcement discretion policy with respect to LDTs. Specifically, on July 31, 2014, the FDA notified Congress of its intent to modify, in a risk-based manner, its policy of enforcement discretion with respect to LDTs. On October 3, 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents entitled \u201cFramework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs),\u201d or the Framework Guidance, and \u201cFDA Notification and Medical Device Reporting for Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs),\u201d or the Reporting Guidance. The FDA halted finalization of the guidance in November 2016 to allow for further public discussion on an appropriate oversight approach to LDTs and to give congressional authorizing committees the opportunity to develop a legislative solution, and FDA issued a discussion paper on possible approaches to LDT regulation in January 2017.\nIn addition, the FDA and Congress have, for over the past decade, considered a number of proposals to end the FDA\u2019s enforcement discretion policy for LDTs and subject LDTs to additional regulatory requirements. For example, Congress has recently been working on legislation to create an LDT and in vitro diagnostic regulatory framework for all in vitro clinical tests, or IVCTs, that would be separate and distinct from the existing medical device regulatory framework. In March 2020, members of the U.S. House of Representatives formally introduced the VALID Act (Verifying Accurate Leading-edge IVCT Development Act of 2020) in the House and an identical version of the bill was introduced in the U.S. Senate. If passed in its current form, the VALID Act would create a new category of medical products separate from medical devices called \u201cin vitro clinical tests,\u201d or IVCTs, and bring all such products within the scope of FDA\u2019s oversight. As proposed, the bill grandfathers many existing tests from the proposed premarket approval, quality systems, and labeling requirements, but would require such tests to comply with other regulatory requirements (for example, registration and notification, adverse event reporting). The bill also provides for IVCTs introduced before the effective date (drafted to be approximately four years after the enactment date) to be transitional and remain on the market subject to certain conditions. It is unclear whether the VALID Act or any other legislative proposals would be passed by Congress or signed into law by the President. Depending on the approach adopted under any legislation, certain LDTs (likely those of higher risk) could become subject to some form of premarket review, potentially with a transition period for compliance and a grandfathering provision.\nEven if the FDA does not modify its policy of enforcement discretion, whether due to changes in FDA policy or legislative action, the FDA may disagree that we are marketing our LDTs within the scope of its policy of enforcement discretion and may impose significant regulatory requirements, including the requirement for premarket review and clearance or approval. We may also be required to conduct clinical studies to support our currently marketed products or planned product launches.\nIf we are required to conduct such clinical trials, delays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing could significantly increase our test development costs and delay commercialization of any currently-marketed tests that we may be required to cease selling or the commercialization of any future tests that we may develop. Many of the factors that may cause or lead to a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to delay or denial of regulatory clearance or approval. The commencement of clinical trials may be delayed due to insufficient patient enrollment, which is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial.\nWe may find it necessary to engage contract research organizations to perform data collection and analysis and other aspects of our clinical trials, which might increase the cost and complexity of our trials. We may also depend on clinical investigators, medical institutions and contract research organizations to perform the trials, and would control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we would be responsible for ensuring that each of our trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on these third-parties would not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities.\nWhen conducting clinical trials, we and our third-party contractors are required to comply with good clinical practices, or GCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the EEA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for products in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any third-party contractor fails to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, Competent Authorities of the Member States of the EEA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before clearing or approving our marketing applications. A failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory clearance or approval process. In addition, if these parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, or if the quality, completeness or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or for other reasons, our clinical trials may have to be extended, delayed or terminated. Many of these factors would be beyond our control. We may not be able to enter into replacement arrangements without undue delays or considerable expenditures. If there are delays in testing or clearances or approvals as a result of the failure to perform by third-parties, our research and development costs would increase, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for our testing products. In addition, we may not be able to establish or maintain relationships with these parties on favorable terms, if at all. Each of these outcomes would harm our ability to market our testing products, or to achieve sustained profitability.\nThe FDA requires medical device manufacturers to comply with, among other things, current good manufacturing practices for medical devices, known as the Quality System Regulation, which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process; the medical device reporting regulation, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or\ncontribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; labeling regulations, including the FDA\u2019s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or \u201coff-label\u201d uses; and the reports of corrections and removals regulation, which requires manufacturers to report to the FDA if a device correction or removal was initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA caused by the device which may present a risk to health.\nEven if we were able to obtain FDA clearance or approval for one or more of our testing products, if required, a testing product may be subject to limitations on the indications for which it may be marketed or to other regulatory conditions. In addition, such clearance or approval may contain requirements for costly post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product.\nThe FDA has broad post-market enforcement powers, and if unanticipated problems with our testing products arise, or if we or our suppliers fail to comply with regulatory requirements following FDA clearance or approval, we may become subject to enforcement actions such as:\n\u2022adverse publicity, warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u2022repair, replacement, refunds, recalls, termination of distribution, administrative detention or seizures of our testing products;\n\u2022operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022customer notifications or repair, replacement or refunds;\n\u2022refusing our requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals or foreign regulatory approvals of new testing products, new intended uses or modifications to existing testing products;\n\u2022withdrawals of current 510(k) clearances or PMAs or foreign regulatory approvals, resulting in prohibitions on sales of our testing products;\n\u2022FDA refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export testing products for sale in other countries; and\n\u2022criminal prosecution.\nAny of these sanctions could also result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the FDA\u2019s and other regulatory authorities\u2019 policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approvals. For example, the results of the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election may impact our business and industry. Namely, the Trump administration took several executive actions, including the issuance of a number of Executive Orders, that could impose significant burdens on, or otherwise materially delay, the FDA\u2019s ability to engage in routine oversight activities such as implementing statutes through rulemaking, issuance of guidance, and review and approval of marketing applications. It is difficult to predict whether or how these orders will be implemented, or whether they will be rescinded and replaced under the Biden administration. The policies and priorities of the new administration are unknown and could materially impact the regulations governing our product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may be subject to enforcement action and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Compliance Matters\nHealthcare policy and payment changes may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nReimbursement to healthcare providers, such as specialized diagnostic service providers like us, is subject to continuing change in policies by third-party payors including governmental payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private insurers and other private payors, such as hospitals and private medical groups. Statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive rate adjustments and administrative rulings, and other policy changes may be implemented with little or no prior notice, all of which could materially decrease the range of services for which we are reimbursed or the reimbursement rates paid for our testing products.\nOn April 1, 2014, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, was signed into law, which, among other things, implemented a new payment system for clinical laboratory tests reimbursed under the CLFS. Under the law, clinical laboratories must report laboratory test payment data for each Medicare-covered clinical diagnostic lab test that it furnishes. The reported data must include the payment rate and the volume of each test that was paid by each private third-party payor. Laboratories that fail to report the required payment information may be subject to\nsubstantial civil monetary penalties. We bill Medicare for our testing products, and therefore we are subject to reporting requirements under PAMA.\nThe PAMA ruling issued on June 17, 2016 included data for reporting for the new PAMA process began in 2017, and in 2018, the Medicare payment rate for each clinical diagnostic lab test, with some exceptions, equaled the weighted median of the reported private third-party payor payment for the test, as calculated using data collected by applicable laboratories during the data collection period and reported to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, during a specified data reporting period. At the beginning of 2020, these revisions to the CLFS have altered payment rates for clinical diagnostic lab tests under the CLFS, the estimated reduction in Medicare reimbursement rate for AVISE\u00ae CTD of 7.3% compared to levels experienced in 2019. Effective March 2020, as a result of our change in the composition of our AVISE\u00ae CTD test, the estimated reduction to the Medicare reimbursement rate for AVISE\u00ae CTD was 5.3% compared to levels experienced in 2019. We do not expect the revisions to the CLFS to impact Medicare reimbursement rate for AVISE\u00ae CTD in 2021 compared to levels experienced in 2020. On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act delayed the next reporting period until 2022 resulting in a 0% reduction for 2021, and the 15% reduction limits would apply in 2022-2024. We cannot be sure how revisions to the CLFS will affect reimbursement rates in the future.\nOther laws make changes impacting clinical laboratories, many of which have already gone into effect. The ACA, enacted in March 2010, among other things, include provisions regarding the coordination and promotion of research on comparative clinical effectiveness of different technologies and procedures, initiatives to revise Medicare payment methodologies, such as bundling of payments across the continuum of care by providers and physicians, and initiatives to promote quality indicators in payment methodologies.\nSince its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the entire ACA is invalid based primarily on the fact that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 repealed the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA, on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, which is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court\u2019s decision that the individual mandate was unconstitutional but remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the case, although it remains unclear how the Supreme Court will rule. It is also unclear how other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact the ACA or our business. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are monitoring the impact of the ACA in order to enable us to determine the trends and changes that may be necessitated by the legislation and that, in turn, may potentially impact our business over time.\nAdditionally, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, resulted in aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, beginning April 1, 2013, and due to additional legislative amendments to the statute, these reductions will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, unless additional congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.\nSome of our flow cytometry tests are reimbursed by the Medicare program under the MPFS. On April 16, 2015, President Obama signed the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, which, among other actions, repealed the previous statutory formula by which CMS established annual updates to MPFS rates. MACRA created the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System which, beginning in 2019, more closely aligns physician payments with composite performance on performance metrics similar to three existing incentive programs (i.e., the Physician Quality Reporting System, the Value-based modifier program and the Electronic Health Record Meaningful Use program) and incentivizes physicians to enroll in alternative payment methods. At this time, we do not know whether these changes to the physician payment systems will have any impact on orders or payments for our testing products.\nMedicare payments are significant to our business, not only because approximately 23% and 25% of the total payments we received from payors for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were derived from the Medicare program, but also because other payors often use the MPFS and CLFS amounts as a benchmark to develop their payment rates. We cannot predict whether Medicare and other third-party payor reimbursement rates that mirror Medicare\u2019s will be sufficient to make our testing products commercially attractive.\nIn addition, some third-party payors have implemented, or are in the process of implementing, laboratory benefit management programs, often using third-party benefit managers to manage these programs. The stated goals of these programs are to help improve the quality of outpatient laboratory services, support evidence-based guidelines\nfor patient care and lower costs. The impact on laboratories, such as ours, of active laboratory benefit management by third parties is unclear, and we expect that it could have a negative impact on our revenue in the short term. It is possible that third-party payors will resist reimbursement for testing products that we offer in favor of less expensive tests, may require pre-approval for our testing products or may impose additional pricing pressure on and substantial administrative burden for reimbursement for our testing products.\nProduct pricing by companies is currently, and is expected to continue to be, under close scrutiny. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures.\nWe also cannot predict whether future healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level or in countries outside of the United States in which we may do business in the future, or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us, including any initiatives implemented by the new Biden administration. Although we cannot predict the full effect of the recent legislative changes discussed above, cost reduction measures, the expansion in government\u2019s role in the U.S. healthcare industry and PAMA\u2019s changes to the reimbursement methodology under the CLFS, such changes individually or in the aggregate may result in decreased profits to us and/or lower reimbursement by third-party payors for our testing products, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nComplying with numerous regulations pertaining to our business is an expensive and time-consuming process, and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties.\nWe are subject to CLIA, a federal law that regulates clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease. CLIA regulations mandate specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration, and participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. We have a current certificate of accreditation under CLIA to perform testing through our accreditation by CAP. To renew this certificate, we are subject to survey and inspection every two years. Moreover, CLIA inspectors may make random inspections of our clinical reference laboratory.\nAlthough we are required to hold a certificate of accreditation or compliance under CLIA that allows us to perform high complexity testing, we are not required to hold a certificate of accreditation through CAP. We could alternatively maintain a certificate of accreditation from another accrediting organization or a certificate of compliance through inspection by surveyors acting on behalf of the CLIA program. If our accreditation under CAP were to terminate, either voluntarily or involuntarily, we would need to convert our certification under CLIA to a certificate of compliance (or to a certificate of accreditation with another accreditation organization) in order to maintain our ability to perform clinical testing and to continue commercial operations. Whether we would be able to successfully maintain operations through either of these alternatives would depend upon the facts and circumstances surrounding termination of our CAP accreditation, such as whether any deficiencies were identified by CAP as the basis for termination and, if so, whether these were addressed to the satisfaction of the surveyors for the CLIA program (or another accrediting organization).\nThe failure to comply with CLIA requirements can result in enforcement actions, including the revocation, suspension, or limitation of our CLIA certificate of accreditation, as well as a directed plan of correction, state on-site monitoring, civil money penalties, civil injunctive suit and/or criminal penalties. We must maintain CLIA compliance and certification to be eligible to bill for tests provided to Medicare beneficiaries. If we were to be found out of compliance with CLIA program requirements and subjected to sanctions, our business and reputation could be harmed. Even if it were possible for us to bring our laboratory back into compliance, we could incur significant expenses and potentially lose revenue in doing so.\nWe are also required to maintain a license to conduct testing in California. California laws establish standards for day-to-day operation of our clinical reference laboratory, including the training and skills required of personnel and quality control. In addition, our clinical reference laboratory is licensed on a product-specific basis by New York as an out of state laboratory and our testing products, as LDTs, must be approved by the New York Department of Health, or NYDOH, on a product-by-product basis before they are offered in New York. We are also be subject to periodic inspection by the NYDOH and required to demonstrate ongoing compliance with NYDOH regulations and standards. To the extent NYDOH identified any non-compliance and we are unable to implement satisfactory corrective actions to remedy such non-compliance, the State of New York could withdraw approval for our testing\nproducts. New York law also mandates proficiency testing for laboratories licensed under New York state law, regardless of whether or not such laboratories are located in New York. Moreover, several other states require that we hold licenses to test specimens from patients in those states. Other states may have similar requirements or may adopt similar requirements in the future. Although we have obtained licenses from states where we believe we are required to be licensed, we may become aware of other states that require out-of-state laboratories to obtain licensure in order to accept specimens from the state, and it is possible that other states currently have such requirements or will have such requirements in the future.\nIf we were to lose our CLIA accreditation or California license, whether as a result of a revocation, suspension or limitation, we would no longer be able to sell our testing products, which would limit our revenue and harm our business. If we were to lose our license or fail to obtain or maintain NYDOH approval for our laboratory developed tests in New York or if we were to lose our license in other states where we are required to hold licenses, we would not be able to test specimens from those states which would limit our revenue.\nIf we fail to comply with healthcare laws and regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe and our partners, including those with whom we may enter into co-promotion or co-marketing arrangements, are also subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we or our partners conduct our business. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, self-referral, fraud and abuse, false claims, and physician sunshine laws and regulations.\nThe Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service, including laboratory services, reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. The term \u201cremuneration\u201d has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor, however, does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute\u2019s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. in order to have committed a violation In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims laws.\nOn June 25, 2014, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or the OIG, released a Special Fraud Alert, expressing concern regarding laboratory payments made to referring physicians and physician group practices for blood specimen collection, processing, and packaging. Specifically, the OIG expressed concern that such arrangements may implicate the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute when laboratories make payments to physicians for services that are already covered and reimbursed by Medicare, or are not commercially reasonable or exceed fair market value, all in order to induce physicians to order tests from such laboratory. Because the choice of laboratory and the decision to order laboratory tests is made or strongly influenced by the physician, with little or no input from patients, such payment may induce physicians to order more laboratory tests than are medically necessary, particularly when the payments are tied to, or take into account, the volume or value of business generated by the physician. We had entered into certain arrangements with physicians for services related to specimen collection, transporting and handling. Effective August 2015, we terminated all such agreements. To date, no regulatory authorities have contacted us regarding these arrangements. To the extent our prior arrangements are found to be inconsistent with applicable laws, we may be subject to significant penalties, including criminal penalties, and exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state health care programs.\nThe Federal civil and criminal false claims law, including the False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making or causing to be made a false statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid by the federal government. A claim includes \u201cany request or demand\u201d for money or property presented to the U.S. government. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under these false claims laws in the name of the\ngovernment alleging false and fraudulent claims presented to or paid by the government (or other violations of the statutes) and to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. Such suits, known as qui tam actions, have increased significantly in the healthcare industry in recent years. In addition, the federal civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.\nWe are also subject to the federal physician self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law, which prohibits, among other things, physicians who have a financial relationship, including an investment, ownership or compensation relationship with an entity, from referring Medicare patients for designated health services, which include clinical laboratory services, unless an exception applies. Similarly, entities may not bill Medicare or any other party for services furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Stark Law constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims laws. Many states have their own self-referral laws as well, which in some cases apply to all third-party payors, not just Medicare and Medicaid.\nIn addition, under the federal civil monetary penalties statute, a person is prohibited from offering or transferring to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration, including waivers of co-payments and deductible amounts (or any part thereof), that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services. Moreover, in certain cases, providers who routinely waive copayments and deductibles for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries can also be held liable under the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and civil False Claims Act. One of the statutory exceptions to the prohibition is non-routine, unadvertised waivers of copayments or deductible amounts based on individualized determinations of financial need or exhaustion of reasonable collection efforts. The OIG emphasizes, however, that this exception should only be used occasionally to address special financial needs of a particular patient. Although this prohibition applies only to federal healthcare program beneficiaries, the routine waivers of copayments and deductibles offered to patients covered by commercial payors may implicate applicable state laws related to, among other things, unlawful schemes to defraud, excessive fees for services, tortious interference with patient contracts and statutory or common law fraud. To the extent our patient assistance programs are found to be inconsistent with applicable laws, we may be required to restructure or discontinue such programs, or be subject to other significant penalties.\nThe ACA, among other things, also imposed new reporting requirements on manufacturers of certain devices, drugs and biologics for certain payments and transfers of value by them and in some cases their distributors to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other health care providers beginning in 2022, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined by the statute) and their immediate family members. Manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each calendar year. Because we manufacture our own LDTs solely for use by or within our own laboratory, we believe that we are exempt from these reporting requirements. We cannot assure you, however, that our regulators, principally the federal government, will agree with our determination, and a determination that we have violated these laws and regulations, or a public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations, could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.\nIt is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws, including our promotion of SIMPONI\u00ae, which is subject to restriction of off-label use discussions. Such a challenge, regardless of the outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business, business relationships, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. Although an effective compliance program can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with these laws may prove costly. If we or our operations, or any of the rheumatologists or entities with whom we do business are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S. and similar programs outside the U.S., a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. To the extent that any of our testing products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-\nmarketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.\nActual or perceived failures to comply with applicable data protection, privacy and security laws, regulations, standards and other requirements could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nFailure to comply with HIPAA, the HITECH Act, their implementing regulations, and similar comparable state laws and regulations affecting the transmission, security and privacy of health information could result in significant penalties.\nNumerous federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, including HIPAA and the HITECH Act, govern the collection, dissemination, disclosure, security, use and confidentiality of individually identifiable health informationhealth-related and other personal information. HIPAA and the HITECH Act require us to comply with standards for the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, or PHI, within our company and with third-parties. The privacy, security and breach notification rules promulgated under HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, or Privacy Standards, and the Security Standards for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information, or Security Standards, under HIPAA establish a set of basic national privacy and security standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, referred to as covered entities, and the business associates with whom such covered entities contract for services. HIPAA requires covered entities, such as us, to develop and maintain policies and procedures with respect to individually identifiable health information that is used or disclosed, including the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. HIPAA also requires us to provide individuals with certain rights with respect to their PHI. If we engage a business associate to help us carry out health care activities and functions, we must have a written business associate contract or other arrangement with the business associate that establishes specifically what the business associate has been engaged to do and requires the business associate to comply with the requirements of HIPAA. Further, in the event of a breach of unsecured PHI we must notify each individual whose PHI is breached as well as federal regulators and in some cases, must publicize the breach in local or national media.\nNotably, whereas HIPAA previously directly regulated only these covered entities, the HITECH Act, which was signed into law as part of the stimulus package in February 2009, made certain of the Security Standards directly applicable to business associates. Further, the HITECH Act and the Final HIPAA Omnibus Rule that was promulgated in 2013, made additional parts of HIPAA directly applicable to business associates. As a result, both covered entities and business associates are now subject to significant civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with the Privacy Standards and/or the Security Standards.\nHIPAA and the HITECH Act also include standards for common healthcare electronic transactions and code sets, such as claims information, plan eligibility, payment information and the use of electronic signatures, and privacy and electronic security of individually identifiable health information. Covered entities, such as certain health care providers, are required to conform to such transaction set standards, known as the Standards for Electronic Transactions, pursuant to HIPAA.\nIn the conduct of our business, we process, maintain, and transmit sensitive data, including PHI. There can be no assurance that a breach of privacy or security will not occur. If there is a breach, we could be subject to various lawsuits, penalties, and damages and may be required to incur costs to mitigate the impact of the breach on affected individuals.\nPenalties for failure to comply with a requirement of HIPAA vary significantly depending on the nature of violation and could include civil monetary or criminal penalties. HIPAA also authorizes state attorneys general to file suit under HIPAA on behalf of state residents. Courts can award damages, costs and attorneys\u2019 fees related to violations of HIPAA in such cases. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to sue us in civil court for HIPAA violations, its standards have been used as the basis for a duty of care claim in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of PHI.\nHIPAA requires covered entities to develop and maintain policies and procedures with respect to individually identifiable health information that is used or disclosed, including the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. The HITECH Act expands the notification requirement for breaches of individually identifiable health information, restricts certain disclosures and sales of individually identifiable health information and provides a tiered system for civil monetary penalties for HIPAA violations. The Final HIPAA Omnibus Rule modifies the breach reporting standard in a manner that will likely make more data\nsecurity incidents qualify as reportable breaches. The HITECH Act also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.\nAdditionally, certain states have adopted comparable privacy and security laws and regulations, some of which may be more stringent than HIPAA. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Further, the CPRA recently passed in California, which will impose additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It will also create a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required. In the event that we are subject to or affected by HIPAA, the CCPA, the CPRA or other domestic privacy and data protection laws, any liability from failure to comply with the requirements of these laws could adversely affect our financial condition.\nIn Europe, the GDPR went into effect in May 2018 and imposes strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the EEA. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Among other requirements, the GDPR regulates transfers of personal data subject to the GDPR to third countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection to such personal data, including the United States, and the efficacy and longevity of current transfer mechanisms between the EU and the United States remains uncertain. For example, in 2016, the EU and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the EU to the United States, called the Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union. Further, from January 1, 2021, companies have to comply with the GDPR and also the United Kingdom GDPR, or the UK GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, i.e., fines up to the greater of \u20ac20 million (\u00a317.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, and it is unclear how United Kingdom data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term, and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated in the long term. Currently there is a four to six-month grace period agreed in the EU and United Kingdom Trade and Cooperation Agreement, ending June 30, 2021 at the latest, whilst the parties discuss an adequacy decision. However, it is not clear whether (and when) an adequacy decision may be granted by the European Commission enabling data transfers from EU member states to the United Kingdom long term without additional measures. These changes may lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure.\nAlthough we work to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards, our contractual obligations and other legal obligations, these requirements are evolving and may be modified, interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with one another or other legal obligations with which we must comply. Any failure or perceived failure by us or our employees, representatives, contractors, consultants, collaborators, or other third parties to comply with such requirements or adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur future growth may depend, in part, on our ability to operate in foreign markets, where we would be subject to additional regulatory burdens and other risks and uncertainties.\nOur future growth may depend, in part, on our ability to develop and commercialize our testing products and promote therapeutics in foreign markets. We are not permitted to market or promote any of our testing products or promote therapeutics before we or our partners receive regulatory approval from applicable regulatory authorities in foreign markets, and we or they may never receive such regulatory approvals for any of our testing products or promoted therapeutics. To obtain separate regulatory approval in many other countries, parties must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, commercial sales, pricing and distribution of our testing products. If we or our partners obtain regulatory approval of our testing products and promoted therapeutics, and ultimately commercialize our testing\nproducts or promoted therapeutics in foreign markets, we would be subject to additional risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022different regulatory requirements for approval of drugs in foreign countries;\n\u2022reduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022the existence of additional third-party patent rights of potential relevance to our business;\n\u2022unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022foreign reimbursement, pricing and insurance regimes;\n\u2022workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is common;\n\u2022production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u2022business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to maintain intellectual property protection our competitive position could be harmed.\nOur ability to protect our technologies such as CB-CAPs and methotrexate polyglutamates, or MTXPGs, affects our ability to compete and to achieve sustained profitability. We rely on a combination of U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications, copyrights, trademarks and trademark applications, and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that the claims in our granted patents and pending patent applications covering our AVISE\u00ae testing products will be considered patentable or enforceable by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, courts in the United States, or by patent offices and courts in foreign countries. If we fail to protect our intellectual property, third parties may be able to compete more effectively against us and we may incur substantial litigation costs in our attempts to recover or restrict use of our intellectual property.\nWe apply for patents covering our testing products and technologies and uses thereof, as we deem appropriate, however we may fail to apply for patents on important testing products and technologies in a timely fashion or at all, or we may fail to apply for patents in potentially relevant jurisdictions, or we may cease our prosecution and maintenance of patents in potentially relevant jurisdictions. Currently, we own or have an exclusive license to 13 issued U.S. patents, and certain corresponding foreign counterpart patents, relevant to our AVISE\u00ae testing products. We also own one issued U.S. patent, two pending U.S. patent applications, a pending PCT patent application, a pending U.S. provisional patent application, and certain corresponding foreign counterpart patents and patent applications relevant to our AVISE\u00ae testing products. While we intend to pursue additional patent applications, it is possible that our pending patent applications and any future applications may not result in issued patents. Even if such patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope thereof, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. Any successful opposition to our patents could deprive us of exclusive rights necessary for the further development of our AVISE\u00ae testing products. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents may not adequately protect our intellectual property, provide exclusivity for our AVISE\u00ae testing products or prevent others from designing around our claims.\nWe might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications and we might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions. To determine the priority of these inventions, we may have to participate in interference proceedings, derivation proceedings or other post-grant proceedings declared by the USPTO that could result in substantial cost to us. No assurance can be given that our patent applications will have priority over other patent applications. In addition, recent changes to the patent laws of the United States allow for various post-grant opposition proceedings that have not been extensively tested, and their outcome is therefore uncertain. Furthermore, if third parties bring these proceedings against our patents, we could experience significant costs and management distraction.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable, or that we elect not to patent, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our AVISE\u00ae testing products and development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. While we use commercially reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our licensors,\nemployees, consultants, contractors and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose such trade secret information to third parties and competitors. We attempt to protect our proprietary technology in large part by entering into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, consultants and other contractors. We cannot assure you, however, that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that competitors will not know of, or independently discover, our trade secrets. We cannot assure you that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or be issued patents that may prevent the sale of our testing products, technologies, services or know-how or require licensing and the payment of significant fees or royalties by us in order to produce our testing products, technologies or services. Further, we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation of our trade secrets and other confidential information.\nMonitoring unauthorized disclosure is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to prevent such disclosure are, or will be, adequate. If we were to enforce a claim that a third party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets, it would be expensive and time consuming, and the outcome would be unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets. If we are unable to prevent unauthorized material disclosure of our trade secrets and other confidential information to third parties, and in particular in jurisdictions where we have not filed for patent protection, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nCertain of our testing products utilize unpatented technology that is publicly available and can be used by our competitors.\nCertain of our AVISE\u00ae testing products, such as AVISE\u00ae CTD, utilize both patented technology and publicly available technology that is not protected by patents or other intellectual property rights. We believe that using certain publicly available technology allows us to offer a better and more comprehensive testing product. However, the publicly available technology which we rely upon is also used in, and may continue to be used in, products which compete with our AVISE\u00ae testing products. Our competitors may independently develop competing diagnostic products and services that do not infringe our intellectual property.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our AVISE\u00ae testing products.\nOur success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly on obtaining and enforcing patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the diagnostics industry involves both technological and legal complexity, and is therefore costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. The United States has enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. We cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents. We may not develop additional proprietary products, methods and technologies that are patentable.\nSome of our intellectual property has been discovered through government funded programs and thus may be subject to federal regulations such as \u201cmarch-in\u201d rights, certain reporting requirements and a preference for U.S.-based companies. Compliance with such regulations may limit our exclusive rights, and limit our ability to contract with non-U.S. manufacturers.\nSome of the intellectual property rights we have acquired or licensed or may acquire or license in the future may have been generated through the use of U.S. government funding and may therefore be subject to certain federal regulations. For example, some of the research and development work related to our CB-CAPs technology was funded by government research grants. As a result, the U.S. government may have certain rights to intellectual property embodied in our testing products pursuant to the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, or Bayh-Dole Act. These U.S. government rights include a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable worldwide license to use inventions for any governmental purpose. In addition, the U.S. government has the right, under certain limited circumstances, to require us to grant exclusive, partially exclusive, or non-exclusive licenses to any of these inventions to a third party if it determines that: (i) adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize the invention; (ii) government action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs; or (iii) government action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations (also referred to as \u201cmarch-in rights\u201d). The U.S. government also has the right\nto take title to these inventions if the grant recipient fails to disclose the invention to the government or fails to file an application to register the intellectual property within specified time limits. Intellectual property generated under a government funded program is also subject to certain reporting requirements, compliance with which may require us to expend substantial resources. In addition, the U.S. government requires that any products embodying any of these inventions or produced through the use of any of these inventions be manufactured substantially in the United States. This preference for U.S. industry may be waived by the federal agency that provided the funding if the owner or assignee of the intellectual property can show that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible. This preference for U.S. industry may limit our ability to contract with non-U.S. product manufacturers for products covered by such intellectual property. To the extent any of our future intellectual property is also generated through the use of U.S. government funding, the provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act may similarly apply.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our AVISE\u00ae testing products in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Moreover, we believe that obtaining foreign patents may be more difficult than obtaining domestic patents because of differences in patent laws and, accordingly, our patent position may be stronger in the United States than abroad. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights in the same manner and to the same extent as laws in the United States. Various countries limit the subject matter that can be patented and limit the ability of a patent owner to enforce patents in the medical and other related fields. This may limit our ability to obtain or utilize those patents internationally. In order to manage our foreign patent costs and focus on the U.S. market, we made the decision to cease the prosecution and maintenance of certain of our foreign patents and patent applications related to our CB-CAPs technology, which is used in our AVISE\u00ae testing products. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but enforcement of such patent protection is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our AVISE\u00ae testing products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nThe patent protection and patent prosecution for some of our testing products may be dependent on third parties.\nWe or our licensors may fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them. Therefore, we may miss potential opportunities to strengthen our patent position. It is possible that defects of form in the preparation or filing of our patents or patent applications may exist, or may arise in the future, for example with respect to proper priority claims, inventorship, claim scope, or requests for patent term adjustments. If we or our licensors, whether current or future, fail to establish, maintain or protect such patents and other intellectual property rights, such rights may be reduced or eliminated. If our licensors are not fully cooperative or disagree with us as to the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of any patent rights, such patent rights could be compromised. If there are material defects in the form, preparation, prosecution, or enforcement of our patents or patent applications, such patents may be invalid and/or unenforceable, and such applications may never result in valid, enforceable patents. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have an adverse impact on our business.\nAs a licensee of third parties, we rely on third parties to file and prosecute patent applications and maintain patents and otherwise protect the licensed intellectual property under some of our license agreements. We have not had and do not have primary control over these activities for certain of our patents or patent applications and other\nintellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that such activities by third parties have been or will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations or will result in valid and enforceable patents or other intellectual property rights. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreements with some of our licensors, the licensors may have the right to control enforcement of our licensed patents or defense of any claims asserting the invalidity of these patents and even if we are permitted to pursue such enforcement or defense, we will require the cooperation of our licensors. We cannot be certain that our licensors will allocate sufficient resources or prioritize their or our enforcement of such patents or defense of such claims to protect our interests in the licensed patents. Even if we are not a party to these legal actions, an adverse outcome could harm our business because it may permit other parties to compete with us. If any of our licensors or any of our future licensors or future collaborators fail to appropriately prosecute and maintain patent protection for patents covering any of our testing products, our ability to develop and commercialize those testing products may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products.\nIn addition, even where we have the right to control patent prosecution of patents and patent applications we have acquired or licensed from third parties, we may still be adversely affected or prejudiced by actions or inactions of our predecessors or licensors and their counsel that took place prior to us assuming control over patent prosecution.\nOur technology acquired or licensed from various third parties may be subject to retained rights. Our predecessors or licensors often retain certain rights under their agreements with us, including the right to use the underlying technology for noncommercial academic and research use, to publish general scientific findings from research related to the technology, and to make customary scientific and scholarly disclosures of information relating to the technology. It is difficult to monitor whether our predecessors or licensors limit their use of the technology to these uses, and we could incur substantial expenses to enforce our rights to our licensed technology in the event of misuse.\nIf we are limited in our ability to utilize acquired or licensed technologies, or if we lose our rights to critical in-licensed technology, we may be unable to successfully develop, out-license, market and sell our testing products, which could adversely affect our business. Our business strategy depends on the successful development of licensed and acquired technologies into commercial products. Therefore, any limitations on our ability to utilize these technologies may impair our ability to develop, out-license or market and sell our testing products.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license intellectual property rights from third parties or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to a number of license agreements under which we are granted intellectual property rights that are important to our business. For example, certain patent rights related to AVISE\u00ae Lupus are licensed from the University of Pittsburgh, certain patent rights related to AVISE\u00ae MTX are licensed from Prometheus. Our existing license agreements as related to our AVISE\u00ae testing products impose various regulatory and/or commercial diligence obligations, payment of milestones and/or royalties and other obligations. If we fail to comply with our obligations under a license agreement, the license agreement may be terminated, in which event we would not be able to further develop or market certain AVISE\u00ae testing products. Additionally, we may not always have the first right to maintain, enforce or defend our licensed intellectual property rights and, although we would likely have the right to assume the maintenance, enforcement and defense of such intellectual property rights if our licensors do not, our ability to do so may be compromised by our licensors\u2019 acts or omissions.\nLicensing of intellectual property rights is of critical importance to our business and involves complex legal, business and scientific issues. Disputes may arise between us and our licensors regarding intellectual property rights subject to a license agreement, including the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues, and whether and the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property rights of the licensor that are not subject to the licensing agreement. If disputes over intellectual property rights that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected. We may enter into additional licenses in the future and if we fail to comply with obligations under those agreements, we could suffer adverse consequences.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent process. Periodic maintenance fees,\nrenewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on any issued patents and/or applications are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications. Our outside counsel has systems in place to monitor deadlines to pay these fees and to remind us of these fees, and our outside counsel employs an outside firm to pay these fees due to the USPTO and to foreign patent agencies based on our instructions. In the aggregate, these fees can be cost prohibitive for an early-stage company. Accordingly, we made a financially-driven decision to prioritize our payment of these fees and to allow certain of our applications to lapse, particularly with respect to our ex-U.S. rights licensed from the University of Pittsburgh related to our CB-CAPs technology. The permanent lapse of certain of these ex-U.S. rights may result in our patent position being stronger in the United States than abroad, such as in countries that are part of the European Patent Convention, and third parties may be able to compete more effectively against us in countries outside the United States, including in those countries that belong to the European Patent Convention. Additionally, while an inadvertent lapse may sometimes be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than should otherwise have been the case, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining necessary rights to product components and processes for our development pipeline through acquisitions and in-licenses.\nPresently we have intellectual property rights, through licenses from third parties and under patents that we own, related to our AVISE\u00ae testing products. Because our programs may involve additional products that require the use of proprietary rights held by third parties, the growth of our business will likely depend in part on our ability to acquire, in-license or use these proprietary rights. We may be unable to acquire or in-license proprietary rights that we identify as being necessary for our AVISE\u00ae testing products, and our partner may be unable to acquire any necessary rights for our promoted therapeutics. Even if we are able to obtain a license to such proprietary rights, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In that event, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or license replacement technology.\nThe licensing and acquisition of third-party proprietary rights is a competitive area, and companies, which may be more established, or have greater resources than we do, may also be pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party proprietary rights that we may consider necessary or attractive in order to further develop our AVISE\u00ae testing products or our partners consider necessary or attractive in order to promote their therapeutic. More established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities.\nIn addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us, either on reasonable terms, or at all. We also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment, or at all. If we or our partner are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to further develop our AVISE\u00ae testing products and promote therapeutics, and our business, financial condition and prospects for growth could suffer.\nThird-party claims alleging intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our development efforts.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patents and other intellectual property rights in the diagnostics industry, as well as administrative proceedings for challenging patents, including interference and reexamination proceedings before the USPTO or oppositions and other comparable proceedings in foreign jurisdictions. The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act introduced new procedures including inter partes review and post grant review. The implementation of these procedures bring the possibility of third-party challenges to our patents and the outcome of such challenges could result in a loss or narrowing of our patent rights. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than should otherwise have been the case, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing our AVISE\u00ae testing products. As the diagnostics industry expands and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our activities related to our AVISE\u00ae testing products may give rise to claims of infringement of the patent rights of others.\nWe cannot assure you that any of our current or future AVISE\u00ae testing products will not infringe existing or future patents. Although we are not aware of any issued patents that will prevent us from marketing our AVISE\u00ae testing products, there may be third-party patents of which we are currently unaware with claims to materials or methods of\nmanufacture related to the use or manufacture of our AVISE\u00ae testing products. If a third party that owns such a patent asserts it successfully against one of our current or future AVISE\u00ae testing products, we may be unable to market our product, which could materially harm our business and because patent applications can take many years to issue and may be confidential for 18 months or more after filing, there may be currently pending third-party patent applications which may later result in issued patents that our AVISE\u00ae testing products or our technologies may infringe, or which such third parties claim are infringed by the use of our technologies.\nParties making claims against us for infringement or misappropriation of their intellectual property rights may seek and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop one or more of our AVISE\u00ae testing products. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial expenses and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to be willfully infringing a third party\u2019s patents, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, pay royalties or redesign our infringing products, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. We cannot predict whether any such license would be available at all or whether it would be available on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or development of our AVISE\u00ae testing products. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we would be unable to further develop our AVISE\u00ae testing products, which could harm our business significantly. Even if we were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which may give our competitors access to the same intellectual property.\nIn addition to infringement claims against us, if third parties have prepared and filed patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO to determine the priority of invention. Third parties may also attempt to initiate reexamination, post grant review or inter partes review of our patents in the USPTO. We may also become involved in similar proceedings in the patent offices in other jurisdictions regarding our intellectual property rights with respect to our AVISE\u00ae testing products and technology.\nWe may be involved in proceedings to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nThird parties may infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate our existing patents, patents that may issue to us in the future, or the patents of our licensors that are licensed to us. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States.\nIn addition, if we or one of our licensors initiated legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our AVISE\u00ae testing products, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering such AVISE\u00ae testing product is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace, and there are numerous grounds upon which a third party can assert invalidity or unenforceability of a patent. Such proceedings could result in an invalidation of our patents. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our AVISE\u00ae testing products. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nLitigation proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nBecause of the expense and uncertainty of litigation, we may not be in a position to enforce our intellectual property rights against third parties.\nBecause of the expense and uncertainty of litigation, we may conclude that even if a third party is infringing our patents or other intellectual property rights, the risk-adjusted cost of bringing and enforcing such a claim or action may be too high or not in the best interest of our company or our stockholders. We are not aware of any third-party\ninfringement of our intellectual property rights that would have a materially adverse impact on our business. In addition, there can be no assurance that our licensors will be willing to bring and enforce claims to prevent third parties from infringing intellectual property that is licensed to us, particularly if the affected intellectual property is less important to the licensor\u2019s business than to ours. In such cases, we may decide that the more prudent course of action is to simply monitor the situation or initiate or seek some other non-litigious action or solution.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nWe have received confidential and proprietary information from third parties. In addition, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other companies in our industry. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise improperly used or disclosed confidential information of these third parties or our employees\u2019 former employers. Further, we may be subject to ownership disputes in the future arising, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our AVISE\u00ae testing products. We may also be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging our right to and use of confidential and proprietary information. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose our rights therein. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and employees.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile, and you may not be able to sell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid.\nThe public trading price for our common stock is affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022actual or anticipated variations in our and our competitors\u2019 financial condition and results of operations;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of new products, strategic partnerships or capital commitments;\n\u2022changes in reimbursement by current or potential third-party payors;\n\u2022issuance of new securities analysts\u2019 reports or changed recommendations for our stock;\n\u2022actual or anticipated changes in regulatory oversight of our testing products;\n\u2022developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022commencement of, or our involvement in, litigation;\n\u2022announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;\n\u2022any major change in our management;\n\u2022changes in accounting principles;\n\u2022announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u2022future sales of our common stock by our executive officers, directors and other stockholders; and\n\u2022general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for stock of life sciences companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions or interest rate changes, may seriously affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. As a result of this volatility, you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources. Any adverse determination in any such litigation or any amounts paid to settle any such actual or threatened litigation could require that we make significant payments.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur could significantly reduce the trading price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise adequate capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nIn addition, our directors and executive officers may establish programmed selling plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act for the purpose of effecting sales of our common stock. Any sales of securities by directors and executive officers, or the perception that those sales may occur, including the entry into such programmed selling plans, could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nIn addition, the holders of 5,167,230 shares of common stock and holders of warrants to purchase 426,827 shares of common stock are entitled to rights with respect to registration of such shares under the Securities Act pursuant to an investors\u2019 rights agreement between such holders and us. If such holders, by exercising their registration rights, sell a large number of shares, they could adversely affect the market price for our common stock. If we file a registration statement for the purpose of selling additional shares to raise capital and are required to include shares held by these holders pursuant to the exercise of their registration rights, our ability to raise capital may be impaired.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable and may lead to entrenchment of management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could significantly reduce the value of our shares to a potential acquiror or delay or prevent changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors. The provisions in our charter documents include the following:\n\u2022a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022the exclusive right of our board of directors, unless the board of directors grants such right to the stockholders, to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022the required approval of at least 66-2/3% of the shares entitled to vote to remove a director for cause, and the prohibition on removal of directors without cause;\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror;\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to alter our amended and restated bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;\n\u2022the required approval of at least 66-2/3% of the shares entitled to vote to adopt, amend or repeal our amended and restated bylaws or repeal the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors;\n\u2022a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022an exclusive forum provision providing that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for certain actions and proceedings;\n\u2022the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the board of directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and\n\u2022advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nWe are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions contained in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Under Section 203, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other exceptions, the board of directors has approved the transaction.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine; provided, that, this provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by Securities Act or the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. To the extent that any such claims may be based upon federal law claims, Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. These choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. By agreeing to this provision, however, the stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the Federal Securities laws and rules and regulations thereunder. Furthermore, the enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies\u2019 certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable. If a court were to find the choice of forum provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur executive officers, directors and principal stockholders, if they choose to act together, have the ability to control or significantly influence all matters submitted to stockholders for approval.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our executive officers, directors and greater than 5% stockholders, in the aggregate, own approximately 74% of our outstanding capital stock. As a result, such persons, acting together, have the ability to control or significantly influence all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and approval of any significant transaction, as well as our management and business affairs. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquiror from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our business, even if such a transaction would benefit other stockholders.\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future. Your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation, if any, in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund the growth of our business. In addition, our Amended Loan Agreement restricts our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock and we may also enter into credit agreements or other borrowing arrangements in the future that will restrict our ability to declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nAn active, liquid trading market for our common stock may not be maintained\nPrior to our IPO, there had been no public market for our common stock. Our common stock only recently began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market, or Nasdaq, but we can provide no assurance that we will be able to develop and sustain an active trading market for our common stock. Even if an active trading market is developed, it may not be sustained. The lack of an active market may impair your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other businesses or technologies using our shares as consideration, which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Global Market, or Nasdaq, could result in a delisting of our common stock.\nIf we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we can provide no assurance that any action taken by us to restore compliance with listing requirements would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements.\nIf securities or industry analysts issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock or do not publish research or reports about our company, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. Currently, we have limited analyst coverage and we do not have any control over such analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. Securities analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of our company, and such lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The price of our common stock could also decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our common stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business. If one or more equity research analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company, and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, and may remain an emerging growth company until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, or IPO. However, if certain events occur prior to the end of such five-year period, including if we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d our annual gross revenue exceeds $1.07 billion or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period, we will cease to be an emerging growth company prior to the end of such five-year period. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include:\n\u2022being permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited interim condensed financial statements, with correspondingly reduced \u201cManagement\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\u201d disclosure;\n\u2022not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\n\u2022reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and\n\u2022exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be reduced or more volatile. In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of these accounting standards until they would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption and, therefore, we may not be subject to the same implementation timing for new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, which may make comparison of our financials to those of other public companies more difficult.\nWe are also a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in the Exchange Act. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an emerging growth company. We may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of these scaled\ndisclosures for so long as our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenue is less than $100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, which require, among other things, that we file with the SEC annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. In addition, Sarbanes-Oxley, as well as rules subsequently adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and Nasdaq to implement provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley, impose significant requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Further, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC has adopted additional rules and regulations in these areas, such as mandatory \u201csay on pay\u201d voting requirements that will apply to us when we cease to be an emerging growth company. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate.\nWe expect the rules and regulations applicable to public companies to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. If these requirements divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The increased costs will decrease our net income or increase our net loss, and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our testing products or services. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and the trading price of our common stock may decline.\nPursuant to Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, our management will be required to report upon the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting beginning with the annual report for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2020. When we lose our status as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and reach an accelerated filer threshold, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. To comply with the requirements of being a reporting company under the Exchange Act, we are in process of upgrading our information technology systems; implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures; and hire additional accounting and finance staff. If we or, if required, our auditors are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and the trading price of our common stock may decline.\nWe cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting once that firm begin its Section 404 reviews, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nIf we use hazardous materials in a manner that causes contamination or injury, we could be liable for resulting damages.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations governing the use, discharge, storage, handling and disposal of biological material, chemicals and waste. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to employees or third parties from the use, storage, handling or disposal of these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, remediation costs and any related penalties or fines, and any liability could exceed our resources or any applicable insurance coverage we may have. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations may become significant, and our failure to comply may result in substantial fines or other consequences, either of which could negatively affect our operating results.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions, for which we are predominantly self-insured. We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce our testing products. Our ability to obtain clinical supplies of our testing products could be disrupted if the operations of these suppliers were affected by a man-made or natural disaster or other business interruption. In addition, our corporate headquarters is located in Vista, California near major earthquake faults and fire zones, and the ultimate impact on us of being located near major earthquake faults and fire zones and being consolidated in a certain geographical area is unknown. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nWe are subject to U.S. and certain foreign export and import controls, sanctions, embargoes, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Compliance with these legal standards could impair our ability to compete in domestic and international markets. We can face criminal liability and other serious consequences for violations, which can harm our business.\nWe are subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations, various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and other state and national anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, contractors, and other collaborators from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or anything else of value to recipients in the public or private sector. We may engage third parties to sell our testing products outside the United States, to conduct clinical trials, and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations, and other regulatory approvals. We have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities, and other organizations. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees, agents, contractors, and other collaborators, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. Any violations of the laws and regulations described above may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export or import privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences.\nWe could be subject to securities class action litigation.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business.", "PERMNO": 18963, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "XGN"}
