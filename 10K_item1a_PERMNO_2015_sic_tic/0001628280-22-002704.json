{"cik": "1364885", "company": "Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties set forth below are those that we believe may materially and adversely affect us, our future business or results of operations, our industry, or investments in our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we deem immaterial may also materially and adversely affect us, our future business or results of operations, or investments in our securities. The risks speak only as of the date hereof, and new risks may emerge or changes to the foregoing risks may occur that could impact our business. The following is a summary of risks that we deem material, which are described in further detail below:\n\u2022Risks Related to Our Industry and Overall Business\n\u2022Our business, financial results, and prospects are dependent on global aviation demand. The continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have had and are expected to continue to have a significant negative impact on aviation demand, our business and our industry, including any potential impacts of vaccination requirements.\n\u2022Our business depends largely on sales of components for a single aircraft program, the B737 MAX, which has had significant reductions in production rate, including suspensions, relating to the B737 MAX grounding and the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional suspensions or reductions in, or increases in, the B737 MAX production rate may create financial and disruption risks for the Company and its suppliers on the program, which, may in turn, affect the Company's ability to comply with contractual obligations.\n\u2022Because we depend on Boeing and Airbus, as our largest customers, our business will be negatively affected if either Boeing or Airbus reduces the number of products it purchases from us or if either experiences business difficulties or breaches its obligations to us.\n\u2022Our backlog is subject to change due to the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the B737 MAX grounding, and related cancellations, potentially with short notice.\n\u2022Our business depends, in part, on securing work for replacement programs.\n\u2022We operate in a very competitive business environment.\n\u2022Our commercial business is cyclical and sensitive to commercial airlines' profitability.\n\u2022Risks Related to Our Operations\n\u2022Our business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy supply chain, meet production rate requirements, and timely delivery of products that meet or exceed stringent quality standards.\n\u2022Our operations depend on our ability to maintain continuing, uninterrupted production at our manufacturing facilities and our suppliers\u2019 facilities.\n\u2022Interruptions in deliveries of or increased prices for components or raw materials used in our products could delay production and/or materially adversely affect our business.\n\u2022Our success depends in part on the success of our research and development initiatives.\n\u2022Our operations could be negatively impacted by service interruptions, data corruption or misuse, cyber attacks, network security breaches or Privacy Regulation (defined below) violations.\n\u2022Climate change poses significant operational, regulatory and other risks.\n\u2022Risks Related to Our Growth Strategy\n\u2022Our acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic alliances expose us to risks, including the risk that we may not be able to successfully integrate these businesses or achieve expected operating synergies.\n\u2022We face risks as we work to successfully execute on new or maturing programs.\n\u2022Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\n\u2022Prolonged periods of inflation where we do not have adequate inflation protections in our customer contracts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\u2022The outcome of legal proceedings and government inquiries and investigations involving our business is unpredictable, and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material effect on our business.\n\u2022We do not own most of the program-specific intellectual property and tooling used in our business.\n\u2022Our business could be materially adversely affected by product warranty obligations or defective product claims.\n\u2022The profitability of certain programs depends significantly on the assumptions surrounding satisfactory settlement of customer claims and assertions.\n\u2022Risks Related to Our Governmental and Global Activities\n\u2022Our global footprint subjects us to the risks of doing business in foreign countries.\n\u2022Our results could be adversely affected by economic and geopolitical considerations.\n\u2022Our business is subject to regulation in the U.S. and internationally.\n\u2022The U.S. Government is a significant customer of certain of our customers and we and they are subject to specific U.S. Government contracting rules and regulations.\n\u2022Risks Related to Employment Matters\n\u2022In order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop and transition key employees, and failure to do so could harm our business.\n\u2022We could be required to make future contributions to our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans and our costs may substantially increase in connection with such plans as a result of adverse changes in interest rates and the capital markets, changes in actuarial assumptions and legislative or other regulatory actions.\n\u2022Increases in labor costs, potential labor disputes, and work stoppages at our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers or customers could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\u2022Risks Related to Our Debt, Liquidity, Financial Estimates and Taxes\n\u2022Declines in our financial condition or expected performance or reductions in our credit ratings could limit the Company\u2019s ability to obtain future financing, increase its borrowing, adversely affect the market price of its securities, or otherwise impair its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\u2022Our debt could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to operate our business due to significant restrictions in our Credit Agreement, which could also adversely affect our operating flexibility and put us at a competitive disadvantage.\n\u2022We use estimates in accounting for revenue and costs for our contracts. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial performance.\n\u2022We may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to fully realize our deferred tax assets.\n\u2022Risks Related to Our Common Stock\n\u2022We cannot assure you that we will continue to declare and pay cash dividends on our Common Stock at historical levels or at all.\n\u2022Spirit Holdings\u2019 certificate of incorporation, bylaws and our supply agreements with Boeing contain provisions that could discourage others from acquiring us and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Overall Business\nOur business, financial results, and prospects are dependent on global aviation demand. The continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have had and are expected to continue to have a significant negative impact on aviation demand, our business and our industry, including any potential impacts of vaccination requirements.\nWe largely support commercial aerostructures customers, and our financial results and prospects are almost entirely dependent on global commercial aviation demand and the resulting production rates of our customers. In response to COVID-19 impacts, our customers, including Boeing and Airbus, decreased production rates across many programs and may further adjust production rates or suspend production in the future, potentially without early warning and within a short time horizon. Suspensions in our production rates or prolonged reductions to rates have in the past resulted in, and could in the future result in, significant challenges and negative impacts on our business, operations and financial performance.\nCOVID-19\u2019s impact on our 2020 and 2021 financial performance resulted in a significant strain on our liquidity and debt balance. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had a debt balance of approximately $3,034.3 million, most of which was unsecured debt, and a cash balance of $2,350.5 million. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had a debt balance of approximately $3,792.2 million, more than 50% of which was secured debt, and a cash balance of $1,478.6 million.\nThe extent to which the pandemic will continue to negatively affect our business and results of operations will depend on many changing factors and developments including, without limitation, the following:\n\u2022the severity, extent, and duration of the pandemic including emerging variants of the virus, its impact on the aircraft industry and aviation demand, and any additional production suspensions or reductions relating to the pandemic;\n\u2022the effectiveness of vaccines and treatments against emerging variant strains of COVID-19 and over the long-term;\n\u2022continued travel restrictions and bans, bans on public gatherings, and closures of non-essential businesses;\n\u2022any potential impacts of vaccination requirements and the ability to retain and recruit the workforce required to meet production requirements;\n\u2022economic stimulus efforts;\n\u2022economic recessions resulting from the pandemic;\n\u2022any inability of significant portions of our workforce to work effectively, including because of illness, remote work, quarantines, social distancing, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022potential lawsuits or regulatory actions due to COVID-19 spread in the workplace;\n\u2022our ability to maintain our compliance practices and procedures, financial reporting processes and related controls, and manage the complex accounting issues presented by the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022the impact on the Company\u2019s vendors and outsourced business processes and their process and controls documentation;\n\u2022potential failure or reduced capacity of third parties on which the Company relies, including suppliers, lenders, and other business partners, to meet the Company\u2019s obligations and needs;\n\u2022the impact on our contracts with our customers and suppliers, including force majeure provisions;\n\u2022the impact on the financial markets, including volatility in the financial markets;\n\u2022the availability and cost of credit to the Company; and\n\u2022the impact of government health and protection policies on future air traffic demand.\nSeveral of these effects have already occurred and any or all of these items may occur or recur, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. While the Company has taken action to reduce costs, increase liquidity and strengthen its financial position in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, there can be no assurance that our actions will mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our business.\nWe expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have a significant negative impact on our business for the duration of the pandemic and for an indeterminate time thereafter until demand grows closer to 2019 levels. We expect our\nbusiness will not improve until our customers are willing to produce aircraft at sufficient levels, which depends upon the public\u2019s willingness to use aircraft travel, the success of vaccination programs across the globe, sufficient OEM demand and orders (without suspension) from airlines, and the ability of airlines to weather the crisis and expand. Further, we expect that the pandemic recovery time for wide-body aircraft may be longer than for narrow-body aircraft due to reduced traveler demand and lower volumes of international travel. If the pandemic worsens or there is significant uncertainty on the aviation industry\u2019s recovery, we may find it difficult to obtain additional financing and/or fund our operations and meet our debt repayment obligations.\nOur business depends largely on sales of components for a single aircraft program, the B737 MAX, which has had significant reductions in production rate, including suspensions, relating to the B737 MAX grounding and the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional suspensions or reductions in, or increases in, the B737 MAX production rate may create financial and disruption risks for the Company and its suppliers on the program, which, may in turn, affect the Company's ability to comply with contractual obligations.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 approximately 35%, 19% and 53% of our net revenues were generated from sales of components to Boeing for the B737 aircraft, respectively. While we have entered into long-term supply agreements with Boeing to continue to provide components for the B737 for the life of the aircraft program, including commercial and military P-8 derivatives, Boeing does not have any obligation to purchase components from us for any replacement for the B737 that is not a commercial derivative model as defined by the Sustaining Agreement. The contract is a requirements contract, and Boeing can reduce the purchase volume at any time.\nIn March 2019, the B737 MAX fleet was grounded in the U.S. and internationally following the accidents involving two B737 MAX aircraft. At Boeing\u2019s direction, Spirit suspended all B737 MAX production beginning on January 1, 2020. Subsequently, there were a number of changes to production rates as a result of the grounding and COVID-19 impacts. These production changes created significant disruption for the Company and its B737 MAX suppliers.\nBoeing\u2019s deliveries of the B737 MAX resumed in December 2020, but the rate at which deliveries will continue and continued impacts of the grounding remain uncertain. We regularly make significant assumptions with respect to the B737 program regarding the number of units to be delivered each year, the period during which those units are likely to be produced, and the units\u2019 expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs. In addition, we regularly make assumptions regarding estimated costs expected to be incurred until resuming a normal production rate consistent with 2019 production levels to determine which costs should be (i) included in program inventory and (ii) expensed when incurred as abnormal production costs. Any changes in these estimates and/or assumptions with respect to the B737 program could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows.\nIf production levels for the B737 MAX program are reduced beyond current expectations due to depressed demand or otherwise, or if we have difficulties in managing our cost structure to take into account changes in production schedules or to accommodate a ramp-up in production, our liquidity position may worsen absent our ability to procure additional financing, we may trigger an event of default under our credit facilities, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted.\nBecause we depend on Boeing and Airbus, as our largest customers, our business will be negatively affected if either Boeing or Airbus reduces the number of products it purchases from us or if either experiences business difficulties or breaches its obligations to us.\nBoeing is our largest customer, and Airbus is our second-largest customer. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, approximately 56% and 24% of our net revenues were generated from sales to Boeing and Airbus, respectively. Although part of our strategy is to diversify our customer base, we cannot assure that we will be successful in doing so. Even if we are successful in obtaining new customers, we expect that Boeing and Airbus will continue to account for a substantial portion of our sales. Our contracts with Boeing and Airbus are requirements contracts that do not require specific minimum purchase volumes, and either Boeing or Airbus can reduce its purchase volume at any time. If either of these customers reduces the requirements under our agreements (as Boeing did in 2019, 2020, and 2021 due to the B737 MAX grounding and the COVID-19 pandemic and other customers did in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic), terminates the agreements or portions of them (due to our breach), a termination for convenience (which is a provision included in most of the contracts, or otherwise), experiences a major disruption in its business (such as a strike, work stoppage, slowdown, or a supply chain problem) or experiences a deterioration in its business, financial condition, access to credit, or liquidity, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Any monetary damages we receive from Airbus or Boeing as a result of a contractual termination may not be sufficient to cover our actual damages.\nOur backlog is subject to change due to the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the B737 MAX grounding, and related cancellations, potentially with short notice.\nFrom time to time, we disclose our expected backlog associated with large commercial aircraft, business and regional jets, and military equipment deliveries, calculated based on contractual and historical product prices and expected delivery volumes. The COVID-19 pandemic may extend or delay the time in which we expect to realize value from our backlog. Additional impacts from the pandemic or other global events may cause our backlog to further deteriorate due to order cancellations or delays, potentially with short notice. Backlog is calculated based on Boeing\u2019s and Airbus\u2019 announced backlog on our supply agreements (which are based on orders from customers) and the number of units the Company is under contract to produce on our fixed quantity contracts. Accordingly, we rely on latest available information from Boeing and Airbus to calculate our backlog, which may not reflect expected cancellations related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of units may be subject to cancellation or delay by the customer prior to shipment, depending on contract terms. For example, our contract with Boeing for the B737 MAX program is a requirements contract, and Boeing can reduce the purchase volume at any time. The level of unfilled orders at any date during the year may be materially affected by the timing of our receipt of firm orders and additional airplane orders, and the speed with which those orders are filled. Accordingly, our expected backlog does not necessarily represent the actual amount of deliveries or sales for any future period.\nOur business depends, in part, on securing work for replacement programs.\nWhile we have entered into long-term supply agreements with respect to the Sustaining Programs, Boeing does not have any obligation to purchase components from us for any subsequent variant of these aircrafts that is not a commercial derivative as defined by the Sustaining Agreement. If we are unable to obtain significant aerostructures supply business for any variant of these aircrafts for which we provide significant content, such as the B737 MAX, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe operate in a very competitive business environment.\nAs the Company seeks to further diversify its program portfolio and product offerings and expand its customer base, we face substantial competition from both OEMs and non-OEM aerostructures suppliers. OEMs may choose not to outsource production of aerostructures due to, among other things, their own direct labor and other overhead considerations and capacity utilization at their own facilities. Consequently, traditional factors affecting competition, such as price and quality of service, may not be significant determinants when OEMs decide whether to produce a part in-house or to outsource.\nSome of our non-OEM competitors have greater resources than we do and may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can. Consolidation of or partnerships among our competitors could also increase their financial resources, market penetration and purchasing power. Providers of aerostructures have traditionally competed on the basis of cost, technology, quality, and service. We believe that developing and maintaining a competitive advantage will require continued investment in product development, engineering, supply-chain management, and sales and marketing, and we may not have enough resources to make such investments.\nIt is very difficult for new aerostructures suppliers to compete against incumbent suppliers for work under an existing contract, because the OEM and the supplier typically spend significant amounts of time and capital on design, manufacture, testing, and certification of tooling and other equipment. A supplier change would require further testing and certification and the expensive movement of existing tooling or the development of new tooling, and would likely result in production delays and additional costs to both the OEM and the new supplier. These high switching costs may make it more difficult for us to bid competitively against existing suppliers and less likely that an OEM will be willing to switch suppliers during the life of an aircraft program, which could materially adversely affect our ability to obtain new work on existing aircraft programs.\nOur commercial business is cyclical and sensitive to commercial airlines\u2019 profitability.\nOur customers\u2019 business, and therefore our own, is directly affected by the financial condition of commercial airlines and other economic factors, including global economic conditions and geopolitical considerations that affect the demand for air transportation. Specifically, our commercial business is dependent on the demand from passenger airlines and cargo carriers for the production of new aircraft. Accordingly, demand for our commercial products is tied to the worldwide airline industry\u2019s ability to finance the purchase of new aircraft and the industry\u2019s forecasted demand for seats, flights, routes, and cargo capacity. Availability of financing to non-U.S. customers depends in part on the continued operations of the U.S. Export-Import Bank. Additionally, the size and age of the worldwide commercial aircraft fleet affects the demand for new aircraft and, consequently,\nfor our products. Such factors, in conjunction with evolving economic conditions, cause the market in which we operate to be cyclical to varying degrees, thereby affecting our business and operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nOur business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy supply chain, meet production rate requirements, and timely deliver products that meet or exceed stringent quality standards.\nOur business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy supply chain, achieve planned production rate targets, and meet or exceed stringent delivery, performance and reliability standards. The supply chain for large commercial aerostructures is complex and involves hundreds of suppliers and their technical employees from all over the world.\nOperational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, have resulted and could continue to result in significant out-of-sequence work and increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers. Our suppliers\u2019 failure to provide parts that meet our technical specifications could materially adversely affect production schedules and contract profitability. We may not be able to find acceptable alternatives, and any such alternatives could result in increased costs for us and possible forward losses on certain contracts. Even if acceptable alternatives are found, the process of locating and securing such alternatives might be disruptive to our business and might lead to termination of our supply agreements with our customers.\nOur suppliers continue to encounter financial difficulty due to the pandemic and residual effects of the B737 MAX grounding. Absent financial support, suppliers may not be able to meet commitments under their agreements with us. If any suppliers fail to supply critical parts and we are not able to secure timely and adequate replacements, we may breach our obligations to our customers. As a result of a breach, customers generally may terminate their agreements or proceed against us for damages and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted.\nAdditionally, the Company\u2019s ability to meet production rate increases is dependent upon several factors, including expansion and alignment of its production facilities, tooling, and equipment; improved efficiencies in its production line; on-time delivery of component parts from the Company\u2019s suppliers; adequate supply and costs of skilled labor; and implementation of customer customizations upon demand. From time-to-time the Company has experienced, and may continue to experience, quality or delivery timing disruptions. This includes common carrier disruptions and other disruptions that affect manufacturing lines, any of which could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s ability to meet commitments to its customers and on its future financial results.\nIn some cases, in order to meet these increases in production rates, we have made and will need to make in the future significant capital expenditures to expand our capacity and improve our performance or find alternative solutions such as outsourcing some of our existing work to free up additional capacity. While some of these expenditures will be reimbursed by our customers, we could be required to bear a significant portion of the costs. In addition, the increases in production rates could cause disruptions in our manufacturing lines, which could materially adversely impact our ability to meet our commitments to our customers, and have a resulting adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations depend on our ability to maintain continuing, uninterrupted production at our manufacturing facilities and our suppliers\u2019 facilities.\nOur manufacturing facilities or our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities could be damaged or disrupted by a natural disaster, war, terrorist activity, interruption of utilities, public health crises (such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), or sustained mechanical failure. Although we have obtained property damage and business interruption insurance where we deem appropriate, a sustained mechanical failure of a key piece of equipment, major catastrophe (such as a fire, flood, tornado, hurricane, major snow storm, or other natural disaster), war, or terrorist activities in any of the areas where we or our suppliers conduct operations could result in a prolonged interruption of all or a substantial portion of our business. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers. We may not have insurance to adequately compensate us for any of these events. A large portion of our operations takes place at one facility in Wichita, Kansas, and any significant damage or disruption to this facility in particular would materially adversely affect our ability to service our customers. Additionally, while any insurance proceeds may cover certain business interruption expenses, certain deductibles and limitations will apply and no assurance can be made that all recovery costs will be covered.\nInterruptions in deliveries of or increased prices for components or raw materials used in our products could delay production and/or materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are highly dependent on the availability of essential materials and purchased components from our suppliers, some of which are available only from a sole source or limited sources. Our dependency upon regular deliveries from particular suppliers of components and raw materials means that interruptions or stoppages in such deliveries could materially adversely affect our operations until arrangements with alternate suppliers, to the extent alternate suppliers exist, could be made. If any of our suppliers were unable or were to refuse to deliver materials to us for an extended period of time, or if we were unable to negotiate acceptable terms for the supply of materials with these or alternative suppliers, our business could suffer and be materially affected.\nOur continued supply of materials is subject to a number of risks including:\n\u2022the destruction of or damage to our suppliers\u2019 equipment, facilities or their distribution infrastructure;\n\u2022global economic conditions, embargoes, force majeure events, domestic or international acts of hostility, terrorism, pandemic, or other events impacting our suppliers\u2019 ability to perform;\n\u2022a work stoppage or strike by our suppliers\u2019 employees;\n\u2022the failure of our suppliers to provide materials of the requisite quality or in compliance with specifications;\n\u2022the failure of our suppliers to satisfy U.S. and international import and export control laws;\n\u2022the failure of our suppliers to meet regulatory standards;\n\u2022the failure, shortage, or delay in the delivery of raw materials to our suppliers;\n\u2022imposition of tariffs and similar import limitations on us or our suppliers; and\n\u2022contractual amendments and disputes with our suppliers.\nIn addition, our profitability is affected by the prices of the components and raw materials, such as titanium, aluminum, steel, and carbon fiber, used in the manufacturing of our products. These prices may fluctuate based on factors beyond our control, including world oil prices, changes in supply and demand, general economic conditions, labor costs, competition, import duties, tariffs, the availability and cost of freight, currency exchange rates, hostilities in jurisdictions that affect raw materials and, in some cases, government regulation. Although our supply agreements with Boeing and Airbus allow us to pass on to our customers certain unusual increases in component and raw material costs in limited situations, we may not be fully compensated by the customers for the entirety of any such increased costs.\nOur success depends in part on the success of our research and development initiatives.\nIn order for us to remain competitive, we have expended and will need to continue to expend significant capital to research and develop technologies, purchase new equipment and machines, and train our employees in the new methods of production and service. Our expenditures on our research and development efforts may not create any new sales opportunities or increases in productivity that are commensurate with the level of resources invested.\nWe are in the process of developing specific technologies and capabilities in pursuit of new business and in anticipation of customers going forward with new programs. If any such programs do not go forward or are not successful, or if we are unable to generate sufficient new business, we may be unable to recover the costs incurred in anticipation of such programs or business and our profitability and revenues may be materially adversely affected.\nWhile the Company intends to continue committing financial resources and effort to the development of innovative new technologies, a strain on the Company\u2019s liquidity, such as the strain caused by the B737 MAX grounding and COVID-19 impacts, have in the past reduced and may in the future reduce the Company\u2019s ability to expend capital to develop such technologies.\nOur operations could be negatively impacted by service interruptions, data corruption or misuse, cyber attacks, network security breaches or Privacy Regulation (defined below) violations.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems to manage and support a variety of business activities, including procurement and supply chain, engineering support, and manufacturing. These networks and systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, are susceptible to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by\ncomputer hackers or insiders, telecommunication failures, user errors, or catastrophic events. If these networks and systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our manufacturing process could be disrupted, resulting in late deliveries or even no deliveries if there is a total shutdown. This could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and we could face financial losses.\nFurther, we routinely experience cyber security threats and attempts to gain access to sensitive information, as do our customers, suppliers, and other third parties with which we work. We have established threat detection, monitoring, and mitigation processes and procedures and are continually exploring ways to improve these processes and procedures. However, the scope and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted and we cannot provide assurance that these processes and procedures will be sufficient to prevent cyber security threats from materializing. If threats do materialize, we could experience significant financial or information losses and/or reputational harm. If we are unable to protect sensitive or confidential information from these threats, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures and, as a result, our present and future business could be negatively impacted.\nData privacy regulations, including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (EU), Data Protection Act 2018 (UK), Law No. 09-08 (Morocco), and Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (Malaysia) (collectively, \u201cPrivacy Regulations\u201d), impose a range of compliance obligations applicable to the collection, use, retention, security, processing, and transfer of personally identifiable information. Violations of the Privacy Regulations may result in significant fines and sanctions. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with the Privacy Regulations, or any other privacy, data protection, information security, or consumer protection-related privacy laws and regulations could result in financial losses and have an adverse effect on our reputation.\nClimate change poses significant regulatory, operational and other risks.\nIncreased public awareness and concern over climate change have led to new and proposed legislative and regulatory initiatives internationally, in the U.S. and regionally, and may lead to additional legislation in the future. New or revised laws and regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws, in this area could directly and indirectly affect the Company, its customers, or its suppliers by increasing production costs, affecting customer preferences or otherwise impacting operations. Compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws, could require additional expenditures by the Company and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, climate change is impacting the severity and frequency of natural disasters, including tornados, floods and hurricanes, and other severe weather events, which have in the past and could in the future disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business in a particular region or globally, as well as the activities of our suppliers and customers. Any of these events could result in temporary or long-term disruption of our operations, including as a result of physical damage to, or complete or partial closure of, one or more of our facilities, or have an impact on the operations of our suppliers or customers. If we are unable to restart operations quickly at key locations, find alternative suppliers or quickly repair damage, we could be late in delivering, or be unable to deliver, products to our customers, which could result in damage to our reputation, business and prospects, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nExisting insurance arrangements may not provide full protection for the costs that may arise from any climate change-related events, and recurring extreme weather events could reduce the availability or increase the cost of insurance. The risks associated with climate change continue to evolve, and we expect that climate change-related risks may increase over time.\nRisks Related to Our Growth Strategy\nOur acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic alliances expose us to risks, including the risk that we may not be able to successfully integrate these businesses or achieve expected operating synergies.\nAs part of our business strategy, we from time-to-time have merged with or acquired businesses and/or formed joint ventures and strategic alliances and may continue to do so in the future. For example, the Company closed the Bombardier Acquisition (as defined below) on October 30, 2020. Combining our businesses may be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected. In addition, events outside of our control, including changes in regulation and laws as well as economic trends, could adversely affect our ability to realize the expected benefits from the acquisition. The success of this acquisition and other acquisitions will depend on, among other things, our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining our and the acquired businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes anticipated synergies and cost savings. The anticipated benefits and cost savings from acquisitions, as well as from joint\nventures and strategic alliances, may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected or could have other adverse effects that we do not currently foresee. Further, the integration of acquired companies and managing relationships with joint venture partners involve a number of risks, including, but not limited to the diversion of management\u2019s attention to the integration or oversight of operations, difficulties in the assimilation or cooperation of different cultures and practices, reliance on sellers under transition services agreements or partners under joint venture or alliance agreements, as well as in the assimilation of geographically dispersed operations and personnel, difficulties in the integration of departments, systems (including accounting, production, IT, and other critical systems), technologies, books and records and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards, controls (including internal accounting controls), procedures, and policies and compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other applicable anti-bribery laws.\nWe face risks as we work to successfully execute on new or maturing programs.\nNew or maturing programs with new technologies typically carry risks associated with design responsibility, development of new production tools, hiring and training of qualified personnel, increased capital and funding commitments, ability to meet customer specifications, delivery schedules, unique contractual requirements, supplier performance, ability of the customer to meet its contractual obligations to us, and our ability to accurately estimate costs associated with such programs. In addition, any new or maturing aircraft program may not generate sufficient demand or may experience technological problems or significant delays in the regulatory certification or manufacturing and delivery schedule. If we were unable to perform our obligations under new or maturing programs to a customer\u2019s satisfaction or manufacture products at our estimated costs, if we were unable to successfully perform under revised design and manufacturing plans or successfully resolve claims and assertions, or if a new or maturing program in which we had made a significant investment were to be terminated or experienced weak demand, delays or technological problems, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Some of these risks have affected our maturing programs to the extent that we have recorded significant forward losses and maintain certain of our maturing programs at zero or low margins due to our inability to overcome the effects of these risks, which have been greatly exacerbated by significantly reduced current and future production volumes related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to face similar risks as well as the potential for default, quality problems, or inability to meet weight requirements and these could result in continued zero or low margins or additional forward losses, and the risk of having to write-off additional inventory if it were deemed to be unrecoverable over the life of the program. In addition, beginning new work on existing programs also carries risks associated with the transfer of technology, knowledge, and tooling.\nIn order to perform on new or maturing programs we may be required to construct or acquire new facilities requiring additional up-front investment costs. In the case of significant program delays and/or program cancellations, we could be required to bear certain unrecoverable construction and maintenance costs and incur potential impairment charges for the new facilities. Also, we may need to expend additional resources to determine an alternate revenue-generating use for the facilities. Likewise, significant delays in the construction or acquisition of a plant site could impact production schedules.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nProlonged periods of inflation where we do not have adequate inflation protections in our customer contracts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nA majority of our sales are conducted pursuant to long-term contracts that set fixed unit prices. Certain, but not all, of these contracts provide for price adjustments for inflation or abnormal escalation. Although we have attempted to minimize the effect of inflation on our business through contractual protections, the presence of longer pricing periods within our contracts increases the likelihood that there will be sustained or higher than anticipated increases in costs of labor or material. Furthermore, if one of the raw materials on which we are dependent (e.g., aluminum, titanium, or composite material) were to experience an isolated price increase without inflationary impacts on the broader economy, we may not be entitled to inflation protection under certain of our contracts. If our contractual protections do not adequately protect us in the context of substantial cost increases, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe outcome of legal proceedings and government inquiries and investigations involving our business is unpredictable, and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are involved in a number of legal proceedings including the proceedings disclosed in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees. These claims may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits could have a material impact on our financial position\nand results of operations. In addition, we are sometimes subject to government inquiries and investigations of our business due, among other things, to the heavily regulated nature of our industry and our participation in government programs. Any such inquiry or investigation could potentially result in an adverse ruling against us, which could have a material impact on our financial position and operating. If we are unsuccessful in any action related to this matter, we may be required to pay a significant amount of monetary damages that may be in excess of our insurance coverage.\nWe do not own most of the program specific intellectual property and tooling used in our business.\nOur business depends on using certain intellectual property and tooling that we have rights to use under license grants from our customers. If these licenses are terminated due to a default or otherwise, our business may be materially affected. In addition, we license some of the intellectual property needed for performance under some of our supply contracts from our customers under those supply agreements. We must honor our contractual commitments to our customers related to intellectual property and comply with infringement laws governing our use of intellectual property. In the event we obtain new business from new or existing customers, we will need to pay particular attention to these contractual commitments and any other restrictions on our use of intellectual property to make sure that we will not be using intellectual property improperly in the performance of such new business. In the event we use any such intellectual property improperly, we could be subject to an infringement or misappropriation claim by the owner or licensee of such intellectual property.\nIn the future, our entry into new markets may be facilitated by obtaining additional license grants from our customers. If we are unable to negotiate additional license rights on acceptable terms (or at all) from these customers, our ability to enter new markets may be restricted.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by product warranty obligations or defective product claims.\nWe are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products and services we provide. Our operations expose us to potential rework obligations, liabilities for warranty or other claims with respect to aircraft components that have been designed, manufactured, or serviced by us or our suppliers. We maintain insurance for certain risks, but the amount of our insurance coverage may not cover all claims or liabilities and we may be forced to bear substantial costs. Material obligations in excess of our insurance coverage (or other third-party indemnification) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, if our products are found to be defective and lacking in quality, or if one of our products causes an accident, our reputation could be damaged and our ability to retain and attract customers could be materially adversely affected.\nThe profitability of certain programs depends significantly on the assumptions surrounding satisfactory settlement of customer claims and assertions.\nFor certain of our programs, we regularly commence work or incorporate customer requested changes prior to negotiating pricing terms for engineering work or the product that has been modified. We typically have the contractual right to negotiate pricing for customer directed changes. In those cases, we assert to our customers our contractual rights to obtain the additional revenue or cost reimbursement we expect to receive upon finalizing pricing terms. An expected recovery value of these assertions is incorporated into our contract profitability estimates. Our inability to recover these expected values, among other factors, could result in the recognition of a forward loss on these programs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Governmental and Global Activities\nOur global footprint subjects us to the risks of doing business in foreign countries.\nWe have activities and operations globally (through wholly owned indirect or direct subsidiaries and joint ventures), including in the United Kingdom, France, Malaysia, Morocco and China. In addition, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales by Boeing and Airbus to customers outside the U.S and, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, direct sales to our non-U.S. customers accounted for approximately 29% of our net revenues. We expect that our and our customers\u2019 international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including:\n\u2022changes in regulatory requirements applicable to our industry and business, including without limitation, changes in tariffs (imposed or threatened) on imports, including tariffs imposed in a retaliatory manner on U.S. exports, embargoes, export controls, and other trade restrictions or barriers;\n\u2022changes in the political, economic, legal, tax and social conditions in the countries we do business in;\n\u2022changes in policies and initiatives including with respect to foreign exchange, foreign investment, and government industrial cooperation requirements;\n\u2022the ability to secure clearances, approvals or licenses, including any requirements mandated by the U.S. Commerce Department, to maintain the ability to provide product or services to certain countries or customers;\n\u2022compliance with foreign labor laws, which generally provide for increased notice, severance and consultation requirements compared to U.S. laws; difficulties enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions; the complexity and necessity of using foreign representatives and consultants;\n\u2022uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees;\n\u2022potential or actual withdrawal or modification of international trade agreements;\n\u2022modifications to sanctions imposed on other countries; changes to immigration policies that may present risks to companies that rely on foreign employees or contractors;\n\u2022compliance with antitrust and competition regulations;\n\u2022differences in business practices;\n\u2022the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over various countries;\n\u2022compliance with a variety of foreign laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other applicable anti-bribery laws; and\n\u2022economic and geopolitical developments and conditions, including domestic or international hostilities, acts of terrorism and governmental reactions, inflation, trade relationships, and military and political alliances.\nWhile these factors and the effect of these factors are difficult to predict, adverse developments in one or more of these areas could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations in the future.\nOur results could be adversely affected by economic and geopolitical considerations.\nThe commercial airline industry is impacted by the strength of the global economy and the geopolitical events around the world. Possible exogenous shocks such as expanding conflicts or political unrest, renewed terrorist attacks against the industry, or pandemics have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, precipitous declines in air traffic. Any protracted economic slump, adverse credit market conditions, future terrorist attacks, war, or health concerns could cause airlines to cancel or delay the purchase of additional new aircraft, which could result in a deterioration of commercial airplane backlogs. If demand for new aircraft decreases, there would likely be a decrease in demand for our commercial aircraft products, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are pursuing growth opportunities in a number of newly developed and emerging markets. These investments may expose us to heightened risks of economic, geopolitical, or other events, including governmental takeover (nationalization) of our manufacturing facilities or intellectual property, restrictive exchange or import controls, disruption of operations as a result of systemic political or economic instability, outbreak of war or expansion of hostilities, and acts of terrorism, each of which could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, the U.S. Government, other governments, and international organizations could impose additional sanctions that could restrict us from doing business directly or indirectly in or with certain countries or parties, which could include affiliates.\nOur business is subject to regulation in the U.S. and internationally.\nThe manufacturing of our products is subject to numerous federal, state, and foreign governmental regulations including related to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. The number of laws and regulations that are being enacted or proposed by various governmental bodies and authorities are increasing. Compliance with these regulations is difficult and expensive. If we fail to adhere, or are alleged to have failed to adhere, to any applicable federal, state, or foreign laws or regulations, or if such laws or regulations negatively affect sales of our products, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows may be adversely affected by penalties or sanctions or reputational degradation. In addition, our future results could be adversely affected by changes in applicable federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations, or the interpretation or enforcement thereof.\nOur operations involve the use of large amounts of hazardous substances and regulated materials and generate many types of wastes, including emissions of hexavalent chromium and volatile organic compounds, and certain chlorinated and brominated hydrocarbon solvents, greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. Spills and releases of these materials may subject us to clean-up liability for remediation and claims of alleged personal injury, property damage, and damage to natural resources, and we may become obligated to reduce our emissions of hexavalent chromium, volatile organic compounds and/or greenhouse\ngases. We cannot give any assurance that the aggregate amount of future remediation costs and other environmental liabilities will not be material.\nThe Company's chemical milling and vapor degreasing processes use various regulated substances that are identified as TSCA (Toxic Substances Control Act) initial chemicals evaluated in risk assessments prescribed by the Lautenburg Chemical Safety Act in the U.S., and therefore may be subject to additional regulations in the near future. The Company is investigating the use of alternative solvents and processes, including control technologies which may require material expenditures, however this business will remain dependent on the availability, use and cost of these materials for the immediate future. To the extent these alternative solutions are not viable, or any enacted regulation does not provide an exception, there could be material capital expenditures required to comply with elimination of the chemicals used in our current processes.\nIn connection with prior acquisitions, we may be indemnified or insured, subject to certain contractual limitations and conditions, for certain clean-up costs and other losses, liabilities, expenses, and claims related to existing environmental conditions on the acquired properties. If indemnification or insurance is not sufficient to cover any potential environmental liability, we may be required to make material expenditures.\nIn the future, contamination may be discovered at or emanating from our facilities or at off-site locations where we send waste. The remediation of such newly discovered contamination, related claims for personal injury or damages, or the enactment of new laws or a stricter interpretation of existing laws, may require us to make additional expenditures, some of which could be material. See Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Matters.\u201d\nAs a manufacturer and exporter of defense and dual-use technical data and commodities, we are subject to U.S. laws and regulations governing international trade and exports, including, but not limited to, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, administered by the U.S. Department of State, and the Export Administration Regulations, administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Collaborative agreements that we may have with foreign persons, including manufacturers and suppliers, are also subject to U.S. export control laws. In addition, we are subject to trade sanctions against embargoed countries, which are administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the U.S. Department of the Treasury. A determination that we have failed to comply with one or more of these export controls or trade sanctions could result in civil or criminal penalties, including the imposition of fines upon us as well as the denial of export privileges and debarment from participation in U.S. government contracts. Additionally, restrictions may be placed on the export of technical data and goods in the future as a result of changing geopolitical conditions. Any one or more of such sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe U.S. Government is a significant customer of certain of our customers and we and they are subject to specific U.S. Government contracting rules and regulations.\nWe provide aerostructures to defense aircraft manufacturers. Our defense customers\u2019 businesses, and by extension, our business, is affected by the U.S. Government\u2019s continued commitment to programs under contract with our customers. Contracts with the U.S. Government generally permit the government to terminate contracts partially or completely, with or without cause, at any time. An unexpected termination of a significant government contract, a reduction in expenditures by the U.S. Government for aircraft using our products, lower margins resulting from increasingly competitive procurement policies, a reduction in the volume of contracts awarded to us, or substantial cost overruns could materially reduce our cash flow and results of operations. We bear the potential risk that the U.S. Government may unilaterally suspend our defense customers or us from new contracts pending the resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations.\nDecline in the U.S. defense budget or change of defense strategies or funding priorities (as a result of political environment, macroeconomic conditions and the ability of the U.S. Government to enact legislation or otherwise) may reduce demand for our defense customers\u2019 aircraft or lead to competitive procurement conditions, which may reduce our defense business sales or margins. Further, changes in U.S. Government procurement policies, regulations, initiatives and requirements may adversely impact our ability to grow our defense business.\nThe FAA prescribes standards and qualification requirements for aerostructures, including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products, and licenses component repair stations within the U.S. Comparable agencies, such as the EASA in Europe, regulate these matters in other countries. If we fail to qualify for or obtain a required license for one of our products or services or lose a qualification or license previously granted, the sale of the subject product or service would be prohibited by law until such license is obtained or renewed and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, designing new products to meet existing regulatory requirements and retrofitting installed products to comply with new regulatory requirements can be expensive and time consuming.\nA FCL is required for a company to be awarded and perform on classified contracts for the Department of Defense (\u201cDOD\u201d) and certain other agencies of the U.S. Government. If we were to violate the terms and requirements of the NISPOM or any other applicable U.S. Government industrial security regulations, we could lose our FCLs. We cannot give any assurance that we will be able to maintain our FCLs. If for some reason our FCLs are invalidated or terminated, we may not be able to continue to perform under our classified contracts in effect at that time, and we would not be able to enter into new classified contracts, which could adversely affect our revenues.\nUnder applicable federal regulations for defense contractors, we are required to comply with the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (\u201cCMMC\u201d) program in the next several years and other similar cybersecurity requirements. Compliance with the CMMC is costly and complex. To the extent that we are unable to comply with the CMMC or other requirements, we may be unable to maintain or grow our business with the DOD or its prime customers.\nRisks Related to Employment Matters\nIn order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop and transition key employees, and failure to do so could harm our business.\nIn order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop, and transition qualified executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, manufacturing, and engineering positions. Competition for experienced employees in the aerospace industry, and particularly in Wichita, Kansas, where the majority of our manufacturing and executive offices are located, is intense. The failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or to implement succession plans for executives and key employees, or the loss of any executives and key employees, could have a significant impact on our operations. Further, changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn 2020, the Company announced significant workforce reductions to assist with alleviating costs due to the B737 MAX grounding and the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company\u2019s ability to ramp up in production rates across multiple programs and on the B737 MAX program will depend, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to hire employees to fill any gaps left by the workforce reductions. If the Company is unable to hire such employees, production could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s operations and strategy require that we employ a critical mass of highly skilled employees with industry experience and engineering, technical, or mechanical skills. As the Company experiences an increase in retirements, the level of skill replacing our experienced workers is being impacted due to the availability of skilled labor in the market and low unemployment rates. Our inability to attract and retain skilled employees may adversely impact our ability to meet our customers\u2019 expectations, the cost and schedule of development projects, and the cost and efficiency of existing operations.\nWe could be required to make future contributions to our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans and our costs may substantially increase in connection with such plans as a result of adverse changes in interest rates and the capital markets, changes in actuarial assumptions and legislative or other regulatory actions.\nOur estimates of liabilities and expenses for pensions and other post-retirement benefits incorporate significant assumptions including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the long-term rate of return on plan assets, and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (salary increases, medical costs, retirement age, and mortality). A dramatic decrease in the fair value of our plan assets resulting from movements in the financial markets or a decrease in discount rates may cause the status of our plans to go from an over-funded status to an under-funded status and result in cash funding requirements to meet any minimum required funding levels. Our results of operations, liquidity, or shareholders\u2019 equity in a particular period could be affected by a decline in the rate of return on plan assets, the rate used to discount the future estimated liability, or changes in employee workforce assumptions.\nAs part of the Bombardier Acquisition, the Company acquired Short Brothers plc (\"Shorts\"), which sponsors the Shorts Pension, a defined benefit pension plan that is closed to new participants. The Shorts Pension closed to the future accrual of additional benefits for current participants at the end of 2021.\nFollowing future valuations of the Shorts Pension\u2019s assets and liabilities or following future discussions with the Shorts Pension\u2019s trustee, the annual funding obligation and/or the arrangements to ensure adequate funding for the Shorts Pension may change. The future valuations under the Shorts Pension are affected by a number of assumptions and factors, including legislative or other regulatory changes; assumptions regarding interest rates, currency rates, inflation, mortality, and retirement rates; the investment strategy and performance of the Shorts Pension\u2019s assets; and actions by the U.K. Pensions Regulator.\nVolatile economic conditions caused by COVID-19 or other events could increase the risk that the funding requirements increase following the next triennial valuation. The U.K. Pensions Regulator also has powers under the Pensions Act 2004 to impose a contribution notice or a financial support direction on Shorts (and other persons connected with the Company or Shorts) if, in the case of a contribution notice, the U.K. Pensions Regulator reasonably believes such person has been party to an act, or deliberate failure to act, intended to avoid pension liabilities or that is materially detrimental to the pension plan, or, in the case of a financial support direction, if a plan employer is a service company or insufficiently resourced and the Pensions Regulator considers it is reasonable to act against such a person. A significant increase in the funding requirements for Shorts Pension could result in the imposition of additional financial contributions to the Shorts Pension and, if such required contributions are significant, could have a material adverse effect on Shorts or our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIncreases in labor costs, potential labor disputes, and work stoppages at our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers or customers could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur financial performance is affected by the availability of qualified personnel and the cost of labor. A majority of our workforce is represented by unions. If our workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, which could cause us to be unable to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis and could result in a breach of our supply agreements. This could result in a loss of business and an increase in our operating expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, our non-unionized labor force may become subject to labor union organizing efforts, which could cause us to incur additional labor costs and increase the related risks that we now face.\nDue to the receipt of occasional government incentives, we have certain commitments to keep our programs in their current locations. This may prevent us from being able to offer our products at prices that are competitive in the marketplace and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate new business.\nIn addition, many aircraft manufacturers, airlines, and aerospace suppliers have unionized work forces. Any strikes, work stoppages, or slowdowns experienced by aircraft manufacturers, airlines, or aerospace suppliers could reduce our customers\u2019 demand for additional aircraft structures or prevent us from completing production of our aircraft structures.\nRisks Related to our Debt, Liquidity, Financial Estimates and Taxes\nDeclines in our financial condition or expected performance or reductions in our credit ratings could limit the Company\u2019s ability to obtain future financing, increase its borrowing, adversely affect the market price of its securities, or otherwise impair its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business requires significant capital. A decline in our financial condition or expected performance for any reason could limit our ability to access the credit and capital markets, increase our borrowing costs, and/or affect the market price of our securities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to access the capital or credit markets or, if we do have such access, that it will be on favorable terms.\nAs of December 31, 2021 our corporate credit ratings were B by Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Ratings, and B2 by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. As compared to the Company\u2019s prior investment grade rating, these ratings and our current credit condition affects, among other things, our ability to access new capital. Further negative changes to these ratings may result in more stringent covenants and higher interest rates under the terms of any new debt.\nThe ratings reflect the agencies\u2019 assessment of our ability to pay interest and principal on our debt securities and credit agreements. A rating is not a recommendation to purchase, sell, or hold securities. Each rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating agency has its own methodology for assigning ratings and, accordingly, each rating should be considered independently of all other ratings. Lower ratings would typically result in higher interest costs of debt securities when they are sold, could make it more difficult to issue future debt securities, could require us to provide creditors with more restrictive covenants, which would limit our flexibility and ability to pay dividends and may require us to pledge additional collateral under our credit facility. Any downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.\nLimitations on our ability to access the capital or credit markets, unfavorable terms or general reductions in liquidity may adversely and materially impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur debt could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to operate our business due to significant restrictions in our Credit Agreement, which could also adversely affect our operating flexibility and put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had total debt of $3,792.2 million. In addition to our debt, as of December 31, 2021, we had $15.9 million of letters of credit and letters of guarantee outstanding.\nOur significant indebtedness could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition in a number of ways by, among other things:\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022limiting our financial flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;\n\u2022having a material adverse effect on us if we fail to comply with the covenants in the Credit Agreement or in the indentures governing our long-term bonds or in the instruments governing our other debt; and\n\u2022increasing our cost of borrowing.\nThe terms of our Credit Agreement impose significant restrictions on us, and subject to certain exceptions, limit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022incur additional debt or issue preferred stock with certain terms;\n\u2022pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders over certain amounts;\n\u2022repurchase or redeem our capital stock;\n\u2022make investments;\n\u2022incur liens;\n\u2022enter into transactions with our stockholders and affiliates;\n\u2022sell certain assets;\n\u2022acquire the assets of, or merge or consolidate with, other companies;\n\u2022incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions or transfer assets to us; and\n\u2022enter into strategic transactions.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with the covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness in the future or, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants. Additionally, the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. If we incur additional debt, the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify.\nIn addition, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our other commitments, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt, sell material assets or operations, or raise additional debt or equity capital. We cannot provide assurance that we could effect any of these actions on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that these actions would be sufficient to meet our capital requirements. In addition, the terms of our existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from effecting certain or any of these alternatives.\nWe use estimates in accounting for revenue and cost for our contracts. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial performance.\nThe Company recognizes revenue using the principles of Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 606, Revenue from contracts with customers (\u201cASC 606\u201d), and estimates revenue and cost for contracts that span a period of multiple years. This method of accounting requires judgment on a number of underlying assumptions to develop our estimates such as favorable trends in volume, learning curve efficiencies, and future pricing from suppliers that reduce our production costs. However, several factors may cause the costs we incur in fulfilling these contracts to vary substantially from our original estimates such as technical problems, delivery reductions, materials shortages, supplier difficulties, and multiple other events.\nOther than certain increases in raw material costs that can generally be passed on to our customers, in most instances we must fully absorb cost overruns. Due to the significant length of time over which some revenue streams are generated, the variability of future period estimated revenue and cost may be adversely affected if circumstances or underlying assumptions change. Our estimated costs have exceeded our estimated revenues under a fixed-price contract in the past, and we have been required to recognize a forward loss on the affected program, which has had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, and this could recur in the future. The risk particularly applies to products such as the B787 and A350, in that our performance at the contracted price depends on our being able to achieve production cost reductions as we gain production efficiencies. Further production rate changes or claims relating to inspection and rework requests may result in additional incremental forward loss charges.\nFurther, some of our long-term supply agreements, such as the Sustaining Agreement and the B787 Agreement, provide for the re-negotiation of established pricing terms at specified times in the future. If such negotiations result in costs that exceed our revenue under a fixed-price contract, or operating margins that are lower than our current margins, we may need to recognize a forward loss on the affected program, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAdditionally, variability of future period estimated revenue and cost may result in recording additional valuation allowances against future deferred tax assets, which could adversely affect our future financial performance.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to fully realize our domestic deferred tax assets.\nAt December 31, 2021, we have recognized a valuation allowance against nearly all of our domestic net deferred tax assets. Changes that are adverse to the Company could result in the need to record additional deferred tax asset valuation allowances resulting in a charge to results of operations and a decrease to total stockholders\u2019 equity.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nWe cannot assure you that we will continue to declare and pay cash dividends on our Common Stock at historical levels or at all.\nOn February 6, 2020, the Company announced that its Board of Directors, or Board, reduced its quarterly dividend to a penny per share to preserve liquidity. The Board regularly evaluates the Company's capital allocation strategy and dividend policy. Any future determination to continue to pay dividends, or to pay higher dividends, will be at the discretion of our Board and will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements and contractual restrictions, including the requirements of financing agreements to which we may be a party. No assurance can be given that cash dividends will be declared and paid at historical levels or at all.\nSpirit Holdings\u2019 certificate of incorporation, by-laws and our supply agreements with Boeing contain provisions that could discourage others from acquiring us and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions of Spirit Holdings\u2019 certificate of incorporation and by-laws may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our current Board. These provisions include:\n\u2022advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Board or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022the authority of the Board to issue, without stockholder approval, up to 10 million shares of preferred stock with such terms as the Board may determine.\nIn addition, our supply agreements with Boeing include provisions giving Boeing the ability to terminate the agreements in the event any of certain disqualified persons acquire a majority of Spirit\u2019s direct or indirect voting power or all or substantially all of Spirit\u2019s assets. See Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Our Relationship with Boeing.\u201d", "PERMNO": 91594, "SIC": 3728, "TIC": "SPR"}
