{"cik": "314489", "company": "FIRST BUSEY CORP /NV/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-08", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis section highlights the risks management believes could adversely affect our financial performance. Additional possible risks that could affect the Company adversely and cannot be predicted may arise at any time. Other risks that are immaterial at this time may also have an adverse impact on our future financial condition.\nEconomic and Market Risks\nConditions in the financial market and economic conditions, including conditions in the states in which it operates, generally may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nIn 2008 and 2009, the United States\u2019 economy faced a severe economic crisis, including a major recession from which it is still recovering. Many businesses and local governments continue to experience financial difficulty and while reflecting improvement, unemployment levels in certain sectors remain elevated. There can be no assurances that these conditions will continue to improve. In addition, factors such as ongoing federal budget negotiations, political differences at the federal levels of the U.S. government, actions taken by the Federal Reserve System, the level of U.S. debt and global economic influences could all have destabilizing effects on financial markets and produce heightened levels of volatility.\nThe Company\u2019s general financial performance is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where it operates and in particular, the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services it offers. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment, natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors.\nFor several years, the economic environment had been adverse for many households and businesses in the United States and worldwide. While economic conditions have improved since the recession, there can be no assurance that this improvement will continue. Economic pressures on consumers and uncertainty regarding continuing economic improvement may result in changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing, and savings habits. Such conditions could adversely affect the credit quality of the Company\u2019s loans and our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance is also affected by the condition of the markets it conducts business in. The financial condition of the State of Illinois, in which the largest portion of the Company\u2019s customer base resides, is among the most troubled of any state in the United States with credit downgrade concerns, pension under-funding, a current budget impasse, budget deficits and political standoffs. State budget restructuring to improve its financial condition may have negative financial effects on local governments and businesses, their employees, and directly and indirectly the Company\u2019s customers. Conversely, a lack of state budget restructuring to achieve budget balance and growing debt burden may also have negative financial effects on local governments and businesses, their employees, and directly and indirectly the Company\u2019s customers.\nThe Company is located in markets with significant university and healthcare presence, which rely heavily on state funding and contracts. Payment delays by the State of Illinois to its vendors and government sponsored entities may have significant, negative effects on the Company\u2019s primary market areas, which could in turn adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, adverse changes in agribusiness and capital goods exports could materially adversely affect its downstate Illinois markets, which are heavily reliant upon these industries. In addition, continued population outflow from the State of Illinois could affect the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers.\nFurther, southwest Florida was particularly impacted by the downturn in economic conditions in recent years. Although recovering, another decline in economic conditions in Florida, particularly within the Company\u2019s primary market area, could adversely affect its business in that market. Another downturn in Illinois and Florida markets could result in a decrease in demand for products and services, an increase in loan delinquencies and defaults, high or increased levels of problem assets and foreclosures and reduced wealth management fees resulting from lower asset values.\nMarket volatility and changes in interest rates could have an adverse effect on the Company.\nIn certain recent periods, the capital and credit markets experienced heightened volatility and disruption. In some cases, the markets produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers\u2019 underlying financial condition or performance. If the capital and credit markets experience these heightened levels of disruption and volatility again, both the Company and its customers\u2019 ability to maintain or access capital could be adversely affected which could have an impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in interest rates could affect the level of assets and liabilities held on the Company\u2019s balance sheet and the revenue that the Company earns from net interest income, as earnings and profitability depend significantly on our net interest income. Net interest income represents the difference between interest income and fees earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and investment securities and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, including the Federal Open Market Committee. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest the Company receives on loans and investment securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect the Company\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair value of the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and investment securities, the Company\u2019s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operation. Interest rates paid on deposit products declined significantly in recent years and while interest rates increased slightly in 2015 for the first time in nine years, future increases, if they occur, could create uncertainty in financial markets. Such uncertainty or market fluctuations could negatively affect customer\u2019s financial stability and ultimately, their ability to repay loan commitments.\nThe Company\u2019s wealth management business may also be negatively impacted by changes in general economic conditions and the conditions in the financial and securities markets, which could affect the values of assets held under care. Management contracts generally provide for fees payable for wealth management services based on the market value of assets under care. Because most of the Company\u2019s contracts provide for a fee based on market values of securities, declines in securities prices may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations from this business. Market declines and reductions in the value of customers\u2019 wealth management accounts, could also result in the loss of wealth management customers, including those who are also banking customers.\nThe Company could recognize losses on securities held in its securities portfolio, particularly if interest rates increase or economic and market conditions deteriorate.\nFactors beyond the Company\u2019s control may significantly influence the fair value of securities in its portfolio and may cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. For example, fixed-rate securities acquired by the Company are generally subject to decreases in market value when interest rates rise. A change in the fair value of securities could cause an other-than-temporary impairment (\u201cOTTI\u201d) in future periods and result in realized losses. The process for determining whether impairment is an OTTI usually requires difficult, subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting interest rates, the financial condition of issuers of the securities and the performance of the underlying collateral, we may recognize realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nDowngrades in the credit ratings of one or more insurers that provide credit enhancements for the Company\u2019s state and municipal securities portfolio may have an adverse impact on the market for and valuation of these types of securities.\nThe Company invests in tax-exempt state and local municipal securities, some of which are insured by monoline insurers. In recent years, several of these insurers have come under scrutiny by rating agencies. Even though management generally purchases municipal securities on the overall credit strength of the issuer, the reduction in the credit rating of an insurer may negatively impact the market for and valuation of the Company\u2019s investment securities. A downgrade or a default by an issuer could adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nRecent legislative and regulatory reforms applicable to the financial services industry, as well as heightened focus on particular regulations, may have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe laws, regulations, rules, policies and regulatory interpretations governing the Company continue to evolve and may change significantly over time as Congress and various regulatory agencies react to adverse economic conditions or other matters. The global financial crisis of 2008-2009 served as a catalyst for a number of significant changes in the financial services industry, including the Dodd-Frank Act, which reformed the regulation of financial institutions in a comprehensive manner, and the Basel III regulatory capital reforms, which increases both the amount and quality of capital that financial institutions must hold. The implementation of these provisions, as well as any other aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to the financial industry, may impact the profitability of the Company\u2019s business activities and may change certain business practices, including the ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans, and achieve satisfactory interest spreads, and could expose the Company to additional expense, including increased compliance costs.\nThese rule and regulatory changes may also require the Company to invest significant management attention and resources so as to make necessary changes to operations in order to comply. Legislative and regulatory changes may limit our ability to promote our objectives through compensation and incentive programs and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company\u2019s management has reviewed the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Basel III Rules, and other regulatory mandated changes, many of which have become effective or are to be phased-in over the next several years, and assessed the probable impact on operations. However, the long-term cumulative effect of these changes on the financial services industry, in general, and the Company in particular, is uncertain at this time.\nIn addition to the expense and uncertainty related to increased regulation, the financial services industry is facing more intense scrutiny from regulatory agencies in the examination process and more aggressive enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels, particularly with respect to mortgage-related practices and other consumer compliance matters, and compliance with Bank Secrecy Act, anti-money laundering laws, and the USA Patriot Act, which focuses on money laundering in the form of terrorist financing. Federal law grants substantial enforcement powers to financial services\u2019 regulators including, among other things, the ability to assess significant civil or criminal monetary penalties, fines or restitution; to issue cease and desist orders; and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations. These enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws or regulations and for unsafe or unsound practices. If the Company were the subject of an enforcement action, it could have an adverse impact on the Company.\nCredit and Lending Risks\nHeightened credit risk associated with lending activities may result in insufficient loan loss provisions, which could have material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThere are risks in making any loan, including risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers, risks of nonpayment, risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral and cash flows available to service debt and risks resulting from economic and market conditions. The Company attempts to reduce its credit risk through loan application approval procedures, monitoring the concentration of loans within specific industries and geographic location, and periodic independent reviews of outstanding loans by its loan review and audit departments as well as external parties. However, while such procedures help reduce risks, they cannot be expected to completely eliminate the Company\u2019s credit risks. Borrowers may experience difficulties in repaying their loans for any of a variety of reasons resulting in a rise in the level of nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies and/or a need for increases in the provision for loan losses.\nThe Company establishes an allowance for loan losses and maintains it at a level considered adequate by management to absorb probable loan losses based on a continual analysis of the Company\u2019s portfolio and market environment. The allowance for loan losses represents the Company\u2019s estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is based upon other relevant information available. The allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships, as well as probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified. Changes to the allowance for loan losses, which are charged to earnings through the provision for loan losses, are determined based on a variety of factors, including an analysis of the loan portfolio, historical loss experience and an evaluation of current economic conditions in the relevant market areas. The actual amount of loan losses is affected by changes in economic, operating and other market conditions, which may be beyond the Company\u2019s control, and such losses may exceed current estimates.\nAlthough management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible, management cannot guarantee that additional provisions for loan losses will not be required in the future. Additional provision could be recorded, either as a result of management\u2019s decision or as a requirement by regulators, to further supplement the allowance for loan losses, particularly if economic conditions unfold in a manner which differs significantly from what management currently expects. Additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses and loan losses in excess of the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses may adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNon-performing assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition, and could result in further losses in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s non-performing assets adversely affect its net income in various ways. While the Company pays interest expense to fund non-performing assets, it does not record interest income on non-accrual loans or other real estate owned, thereby adversely affecting its income and returns on assets and equity, and its loan administration costs increase and the Company\u2019s efficiency ratio is adversely affected. When the Company takes collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, it is required to mark the collateral to its then-fair market value, which, when compared to the outstanding balance of the loan, may result in a loss. These non-performing loans and other real estate owned also increase its risk profile and the capital its regulators believe is appropriate in light of such risks. The resolution of non-performing assets requires significant time commitments from management, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities. The Company cannot guarantee that it will not experience increases in non-performing loans in the future, and its non-performing assets may result in further losses in the future.\nConcentrations of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses.\nThe Company may have higher credit risk, or experience higher credit losses, to the extent its loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral. A significant portion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio is made up of commercial and industrial loans and secured by real estate. Thus, deterioration in economic conditions or real estate values could result in higher credit costs and losses to the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s commercial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Most often, this collateral is accounts receivable, inventory, machinery or real estate. Credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans and the probability of repayment is based on the liquidation of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a personal guarantee, which the Company requires whenever appropriate on commercial loans. As a result, in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. The collateral securing other loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. As a result of the larger average size of each commercial loan as well as collateral that is generally less readily-marketable, losses incurred on a small number of commercial loans could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s loans are collateralized by real estate. The market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of market conditions in the area in which the real estate is located. Adverse changes affecting real estate values and the liquidity of real estate in one or more markets could increase the credit risk associated with the Company\u2019s loan portfolio, and could result in losses which would adversely affect profitability. Such changes especially affected the Company\u2019s southwest Florida market in recent years during the financial crisis. Adverse changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity generally, and in downstate Illinois and southwest Florida specifically, could significantly impair the value of property pledged as collateral on loans and affect the Company\u2019s ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses. Collateral may have to be sold for less than the outstanding balance of the loan which would result in losses.\nCredit risk associated with concentration of securities in the Company\u2019s investment portfolio may increase the potential for loss.\nThe Company\u2019s investment portfolio consists, in part, of securities issued by government or government sponsored agencies and non-government entities. A downturn in the financial condition of the issuers, the performance of the underlying collateral, or the financial condition of the individual mortgagors with the respect of the underlying securities could create results such as rating agency downgrades of the securities and default by issuers or individual mortgagors. Any of the foregoing factors could cause an other-than-temporary impairment in future periods and result in realized losses, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nReal estate construction, land acquisition and development loans are based upon estimates of costs and values associated with the complete project. These estimates may be inaccurate, and the Company may be exposed to significant losses on loans for these projects.\nConstruction, land acquisition, and development loans involve additional risks because funds are advanced upon the security of the project, which is of uncertain value prior to its completion, and costs may exceed realizable values in declining real estate markets. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs and the realizable market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation on real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. As a result, construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If the Company\u2019s appraisal of the value of the completed project proves to be overstated or market values or rental rates decline, there may be inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project. If the Company is forced to foreclose on a project prior to or at completion due to a default, there can be no assurance that it will be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of, and accrued interest on, the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs. In addition, the Company may be required to fund additional amounts to complete the project and may have to hold the property for an unspecified period of time while it attempts to dispose of it.\nCapital and Liquidity Risks\nThe Company is required to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, and if it fails to maintain sufficient capital, whether as a result of losses, inability to raise additional capital or otherwise, its financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations, as well as its ability to maintain regulatory compliance would be adversely affected.\nFirst Busey, the Bank and Busey Wealth Management must meet regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity. The Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital, when and if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry and market condition, and governmental activities, many of which are outside the Company\u2019s control, and on its financial condition and performance. Accordingly, the Company cannot guarantee that it will be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to the Company. If it fails to meet these capital and other regulatory requirements, its financial condition, liquidity and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to continue to maintain capital ratios in excess of the amounts necessary to be considered \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d for bank regulatory purposes could affect customer confidence, its ability to grow, its costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs, its ability to pay dividends to its stockholders or on outstanding stock, its ability to make acquisitions, and its business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, under FDIC rules, if the Company ceases to meet the requirements to be considered a \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d institution for bank regulatory purposes, the interest rates it pays on deposits and its ability to accept, renew or rollover deposits, particularly brokered deposits, may be restricted.\nLiquidity risks could affect operations and jeopardize the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity is essential to the Company\u2019s business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on liquidity. The Company\u2019s primary sources of funds consist of deposits and funds from sales of investment securities, investment maturities and sales, and cash from operations. Additional liquidity is available through repurchase agreements, brokered deposits, and the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank and the FHLB. Access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize the Company\u2019s activities or on terms that are acceptable to the Company could be impaired by factors that affect it directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\nDuring periods of economic turmoil, the financial services industry and the credit markets generally may be materially and adversely affected by significant declines in asset values and depressed levels of liquidity. These and other factors could negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions with other financial institutions, lead to market-wide liquidity problems, loss of depositor, creditor, and counterparty confidence which could lead to losses or defaults by the Company or by other institutions. Furthermore, regional and community banks generally have less access to the capital markets than do the national and super-regional banks because of their smaller size, limited analyst coverage, and lack of credit rating resulting from significant expense required to obtain it.\nAny decline in available funding and/or capital could adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet its expenses, pay dividends to its stockholders, or meet deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on its liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could negatively affect the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be negatively affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. Defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and losses of depositor, creditor and counterparty confidence and could lead to losses or defaults by the Company or by other institutions. The Company could experience increases in deposits and assets as a result of the difficulties or failures of other banks, which would increase the funding needed to support its growth.\nCompetitive and Strategic Risks\nThe Company faces strong competition from financial service companies and other companies that offer banking and wealth management services, which could harm its business.\nThe Company currently conducts its banking operations primarily in downstate Illinois and southwest Florida. In addition, it currently offers fiduciary and wealth management services through Trevett Capital Partners and Busey Wealth Management, which account for an important portion of its noninterest income. Many competitors offer the same, or a wider variety of, banking and wealth management services within the Company\u2019s market areas. These competitors include national banks, regional banks and other community banks. The Company also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loan institutions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit unions, mortgage banks and other financial intermediaries. In addition, a number of out-of-state financial intermediaries have opened production offices or otherwise solicit deposits in the Company\u2019s market areas. Also, technology and other changes have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks. For example, customers can maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds. Customers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \u201cdisintermediation,\u201d could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. Increased competition in the Company\u2019s markets may result in reduced loans, deposits and commissions and brokers\u2019 fees, as well as reduced net interest margin and profitability. Ultimately, the Company may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. If the Company is unable to attract and retain banking and wealth management customers, it may be unable to grow its loan and deposit portfolios or its wealth management commissions, which could adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFirst Busey may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger.\nFirst Busey and Pulaski have operated and, until the completion of the Merger, will continue to operate, independently. The success of the Merger, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend on, among other things, First Busey\u2019s ability to combine the businesses of First Busey and Pulaski in a manner that permits growth opportunities, including, among other things, enhanced revenues and revenue synergies, an expanded market reach and operating efficiencies, and does not materially disrupt the existing customer relationships of First Busey or Pulaski nor result in decreased revenues due to any loss of customers. If First Busey is not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. Moreover, First Busey will be exposed to potential asset and credit quality risks and unknown or contingent liabilities of Pulaski. If these issues or liabilities exceed its estimates, First Busey\u2019s earnings and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Merger could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy and could have an adverse effect on the surviving corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nThe Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the Merger may not be completed.\nThe Merger Agreement is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the Merger. Those conditions include: approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions it contemplates by Pulaski and First Busey stockholders, absence of orders prohibiting completion of the Merger, approval of the issuance of First Busey common stock, as applicable, for listing on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, the accuracy of the representations and warranties by both parties (subject to the materiality standards set forth in the Merger Agreement) and the performance by both\nparties of their covenants and agreements, and the receipt by both parties of legal opinions from their respective tax counsels. These conditions to the closing of the Merger may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the Merger may not be completed. In addition, the parties can mutually decide to terminate the Merger Agreement at any time, before or after stockholder approval, or First Busey or Pulaski may elect to terminate the Merger Agreement in certain other circumstances.\nFirst Busey will incur transaction and integration costs in connection with the Merger.\nFirst Busey has incurred and expects that it will incur significant, non-recurring costs in connection with consummating the Merger. In addition, First Busey will incur integration costs following the completion of the Merger as First Busey integrates the businesses of the two companies, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. There can be no assurances that the expected benefits and efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will be realized to offset these transaction and integration costs over time. First Busey may also incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to retain key employees. First Busey will also incur significant legal, financial advisor, accounting, banking and consulting fees, fees relating to regulatory filings and notices, SEC filing fees, printing and mailing fees and other costs associated with the merger.\nAccounting and Tax Risks\nFinancial statements are created, in part, by assumption and methods used by management, which, if incorrect, could cause unexpected losses in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance is impacted by accounting principles, policies and guidelines. Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of assets or liabilities and financial results. Certain accounting policies are critical and require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If such estimates or assumptions underlying the Company\u2019s financial statements are incorrect, it may experience material losses.\nOne such assumption and estimate is the valuation analysis of its goodwill. Although the Company\u2019s analysis does not indicate impairments exist; it could be required to perform additional goodwill impairment assessments on at least an annual basis, and perhaps more frequently, which could result in further goodwill impairment charges. Any future goodwill impairment charge, on the current goodwill balance or future goodwill arising out of acquisitions, such as the anticipated acquisition of Pulaski set to occur in 2016, that the Company is required to take could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations by reducing net income or increasing net losses.\nThe Company is subject to changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines.\nPeriodically, agencies such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements. These changes are beyond the Company\u2019s control, can be difficult to predict and could materially impact it reports its financial condition and results of operations. Changes in these standards are continuously occurring, and given recent economic conditions, more drastic changes may occur. The implementation of such changes could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company may not realize tax benefits which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company had recorded $21.6 million in deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are designed to reduce subsequent period\u2019s income tax expense and arise, in part, as a result of net loss carry-overs, allowance for loan losses, stock-based compensation, and deferred compensation. Such items are recorded as assets when it is anticipated the asset will be used in future periods. Valuation allowance is established when it is unlikely the assets will be realized. Significant judgment by management about matters that are by nature uncertain is required to record a deferred tax asset and establish a valuation allowance.\nIn evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, the Company estimated future taxable income based on management forecasts and tax planning strategies that may be available to us. If future events differ significantly from our current forecasts, it may need to establish a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets, which would have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition. In addition, current portions of the net deferred tax assets relate to tax-effected state net operating loss carry-forward, the utilization of which may be further limited in the event of certain material changes in its ownership.\nIn addition, changes in ownership could further limit the Company\u2019s realization of deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods prior to the expiration of the related net operating losses and the limitation of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 382 of the Code contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change to utilize its net operating loss carry-forwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. The Company anticipates issuing a significant amount of common stock in connection with the acquisition of Pulaski. While this will not affect an ownership change under Section 382, it may make it more likely that an ownership change under Section 382 will occur in the future. If the Company undergoes an ownership change for purposes of Section 382 as a result of future transactions involving its common stock, its ability to use any of our net operating loss carry-forwards, tax credit carry-forwards or net unrealized built-in losses at the time of ownership change would be subject to the limitations of Section 382 on its use against future taxable income. The limitation may affect the amount of the Company\u2019s deferred income tax asset and, depending on the limitation, a portion of its built-in losses, any net operating loss carry-forwards or tax credit carry-forwards could expire before it would be able to use them. This could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flow.\nOperational Risks\nThe Company relies on the integrity of its operating systems and employees, and those of third parties and certain failures of such systems or error by such employees or customers could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations.\nCommunications and information systems are essential to conduct the Company\u2019s business, as it uses such systems to manage customer transactions and relationships, the general ledger, and deposits, loans, and investments. However, the computer systems and network infrastructure the Company uses could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems as operations are dependent upon the protection of computer equipment against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event, as well as from security breaches, cybersecurity attacks, viruses and other disruptive problems caused by hackers.\nIn addition, the Company outsources certain processing functions to third-party providers. If third-party providers encounter difficulties or if the Company has difficulty in communicating with them, the ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions may be affected and business operations may be adversely impacted. If third-party providers are unable to meet service expectations, experience system or processing failure, or incur disruptions affecting operations, results could adversely impact the Company. The Company follows certain due diligence procedures in reviewing and vetting its third-parties, however, it cannot control their actions.\nAlthough the Company has procedures in place to prevent or limit the effects of any of these potential problems and intends to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent such occurrences, technology-related disruptions, failures and cybersecurity risks are a constant threat, both for the Company and for the third-parties it works with. Therefore, it cannot guarantee that these measures will be successful. Any failure, interruption in, or breach in security of, its computer systems and network infrastructure, as well as those of its customers engaging in internet banking activities or electronic funds transfers, could damage its reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject it to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose it to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nSimilarly, the Company is reliant upon its employees. Such dependencies create risks for potential losses resulting from employee errors, breakdowns in process or control, failures to properly execute change management, negligence, or a number of other factors outside the Company\u2019s control. It The Company maintains a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors, customer or employee fraud and other disruptions which might impact its business. In addition, Internal Audit routinely reviews operations and high risk areas for error, deficient controls, and failure to adhere to policy.\nPotential legal actions, fines and civil money penalties could arise as results of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity.\nA breach in the security of the Company\u2019s systems could disrupt its businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage its reputation and create significant financial and legal exposure for the Company.\nAlthough the Company devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade systems and processes designed to protect the security of its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets, these measures do\nnot provide absolute security. In fact, several financial services institutions, retailers and other companies have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means. Some companies in the United States have experienced well-publicized attacks from technically sophisticated and well-resourced third-parties that were intended to disrupt normal business activities by making internet banking systems inaccessible to customers for extended periods. These \u201cdenial-of-service\u201d attacks may not have breached data security systems, but require substantial resources to defend, and may affect customer satisfaction and behavior. Furthermore, even if not directed at the Company, attacks on financial or other institutions important to the overall functioning of the financial system could adversely affect, directly or indirectly, aspects of the Company\u2019s businesses.\nThreats to security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other third-parties, their personnel, and their use of subcontractors. Furthermore, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms the Company and its third-party service providers use to encrypt and protect customer transaction data. Such cyber incidents may go undetected for a period of time.\nThe Company also faces risks related to cyber-attacks and other security breaches in connection with credit card and debit card transactions that typically involve the transmission of sensitive information regarding the Company\u2019s customers through various third-parties, including merchant acquiring banks, payment processors, payment card networks and its processors. Because card transactions involve third-parties and environments such as the point of sale that the Company does not control or secure, future security breaches or cyber-attacks affecting any of these third-parties could impact the Company through no fault of its own, and in some cases it may have exposure and suffer losses for breaches or attacks relating to them. Further cyber-attacks or other breaches in the future, whether affecting the Company or others, could intensify consumer concern and regulatory focus and result in reduced use of payment cards and increased costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nPenetration or circumvention of the Company\u2019s security systems could result in serious negative consequences for the Company, including significant disruption of the Company\u2019s operations, misappropriation of confidential information of the Company or that of its customers, or damage to computers or system of the Company and those of its customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to the Company or its customers, loss of confidence in the Company\u2019s security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, all of which would adversely affect the Company.\nThese risks have increased for all financial institutions as new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies, including mobile devices, to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others. Despite the Company\u2019s efforts to prevent or limit the effects of potential threats, it is possible that the Company may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventative measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because security-related attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties, including parties sponsored by hostile foreign governments. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, third-party service providers or other users of the Company\u2019s systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the Company\u2019s data or that of its customers. These risks may increase in the future as the Company increases its mobile payments, internet-based product offerings, and expand its internal usage of web-based products and applications.\nCustomer or employee fraud may affect operations, result in significant financial loss, and have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s reputation.\nMisconduct could subject the Company to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm its reputation. Misconduct by employees and customers could include hiding unauthorized activities, improper or unauthorized activities or improper use of confidential information. It is not possible to prevent all errors and misconduct, and the precautions the Company takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases.\nCustomer or other outsiders may also attempt to perpetuate fraud or scams in the form of identity theft, money laundering, fraudulent or altered deposits, or use of counterfeit instruments, as a few examples. The Company also faces fraud risk associated with the origination of loans, including the intentional misstatement of information in property appraisals or other underwriting documentation provided to it by customers or by third-parties. Customers may expose the Company to certain fraud risks associated with the compromise of their computing systems or accounts, as well.\nShould the Company\u2019s internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, such failures could adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. Both the number and sophistication level of attempted fraudulent transactions are increasing. Should our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence of fraud, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain management and key personnel may affect future growth and earnings and legislation imposing new compensation restrictions could adversely affect its ability to do so.\nMuch of the Company\u2019s success and growth has been influenced strongly by its ability to attract and retain management experienced in banking and financial services and familiar with the communities in its market areas. The Company\u2019s ability to retain executive officers, current management teams, lending and retail banking officers, and administrative staff of its subsidiaries continues to be important to the successful implementation of its strategy. Also critical is the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain qualified staff with the appropriate level of experience and knowledge about its market areas so as to implement its community-based operating strategy. The unexpected loss of services of key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nDamage resulting from negative publicity could harm the Company\u2019s reputation and adversely impact its business and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to attract and maintain customers, investors, and employees is contingent upon maintaining trust. Negative public opinion could result from the Company\u2019s actual or alleged conduct in a number of activities, including, but not limited to, employee misconduct, a failure or perceived failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality or to treat customers fairly, faulty lending practices, compliance failures, security breaches, corporate governance, sharing or inadequate protection of customer information, failure to comply with laws or regulations, and actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to that conduct. The results of such actual or alleged misconduct could include customer dissatisfaction, inability to attract potential acquisition prospects, litigation, and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which could lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. No assurance can be made, despite the cost or efforts made by the Company to address the issues arising from reputational harm, that results could not adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of terrorism or war or other adverse external events could significantly impact the Company\u2019s business.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of terrorism or war and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business. In addition, such events could affect the stability of the Company\u2019s deposit base; impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. The occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operation.\nThe Company\u2019s framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss.\nThe Company\u2019s risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss. It has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report, and analyze the types of risk to which it is subject, compliance risk and reputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations. Risks may exist, or emerge in the future, that have not been appropriately identified or anticipated. The Company\u2019s ability to successfully identify and manage the risks it faces is an important factor that can significantly impact results. If its risk management framework proves ineffective, the Company could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 86382, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BUSE"}
