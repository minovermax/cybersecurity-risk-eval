Before investing in our Common Stock, you should consider carefully the specific risks detailed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and any prospectus or prospectus supplement. If any of these risks occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed, the price of our Common Stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nWe have a history of significant recurring losses totaling approximately $145.9 million at December 31, 2015, and these losses may continue in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $145.9 million, and these losses may continue in the future. We expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability, and we may never achieve profitability.\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future.\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past. These fluctuations in operating results are the consequence of:\n\u25cf\nvarying demand for and market acceptance of our technology and products;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our product or customer mix;\n\u25cf\nthe gain or loss of one or more key customers or their key customers, or significant changes in the financial condition of one or more of our key customers or their key customers;\n\u25cf\nour ability to introduce, certify and deliver new products and technologies on a timely basis;\n\u25cf\nthe announcement or introduction of products and technologies by our competitors;\n\u25cf\ncompetitive pressures on selling prices;\n\u25cf\ncosts associated with acquisitions and the integration of acquired companies, products and technologies;\n\u25cf\nour ability to successfully integrate acquired companies, products and technologies;\n\u25cf\nour accounting and legal expenses; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic conditions.\nThese factors, some of which are not within our control, will likely continue in the future. To respond to these and other factors, we may need to make business decisions that could result in failure to meet financial expectations. If our quarterly operating results fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could drop suddenly and significantly. Most of our expenses, such as employee compensation and inventory, are relatively fixed in the short term. Moreover, our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future revenue levels. As a result, if our revenue for a particular period were below our expectations, we would not be able to proportionately reduce our operating expenses for that period. Any revenue shortfall would have a disproportionately negative effect on our operating results for the period.\nWe depend upon a small number of large system sales ranging from $100,000 to in excess of $2,000,000 and we may fail to achieve one or more large system sales in the future.\nHistorically, we have derived a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of sales of large, relatively expensive systems, typically ranging in price from $100,000 to $2,000,000. If we fail to receive orders for these large systems in a given sales cycle on a consistent basis, our business could be significantly harmed. Further, our quarterly results are difficult to predict because we cannot predict in which quarter, if any, large system sales will occur in a given year. As a result, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not a good indication of our future performance. In some future quarters, our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, in which case the market price of our Common Stock may decrease significantly.\nOur lengthy sales cycle may cause us to expend significant resources for as long as one year in anticipation of a sale to certain customers, yet we still may fail to complete the sale.\nWhen considering the purchase of a large computerized identity management system, potential customers may take as long as eighteen months to evaluate different systems and obtain approval for the purchase. Under these circumstances, if we fail to complete a sale, we will have expended significant resources and received no revenue in return. Generally, customers consider a wide range of issues before committing to purchase our products, including product benefits, ability to operate with their current systems, product reliability and their own budgetary constraints. While potential customers are evaluating our products, we may incur substantial selling costs and expend significant management resources in an effort to accomplish potential sales that may never occur. In times of economic recession, our potential customers may be unwilling or unable to commit resources to the purchase of new and costly systems.\nA significant number of our customers and potential customers are government agencies that are subject to unique political and budgetary constraints and have special contracting requirements, which may affect our ability to obtain new and retain current government customers.\nA significant number of our customers are government agencies. These agencies often do not set their own budgets and therefore have little control over the amount of money they can spend from quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year. In addition, these agencies experience political pressure that may dictate the manner in which they spend money. Due to political and budgetary processes and other scheduling delays that may frequently occur relating to the contract or bidding process, some government agency orders may be canceled or substantially delayed, and the receipt of revenues or payments from these agencies may be substantially delayed. In addition, future sales to government agencies will depend on our ability to meet government contracting requirements, certain of which may be onerous or impossible to meet, resulting in our inability to obtain a particular contract. Common requirements in government contracts include bonding requirements, provisions permitting the purchasing agency to modify or terminate at will the contract without penalty, and provisions permitting the agency to perform investigations or audits of our business practices, any of which may limit our ability to enter into new contracts or maintain our current contracts.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, two customers accounted for approximately 37% of our total revenues. Any material decrease in revenue from these customers, or in the event the Company is unable to replace the revenue with additional customers, our financial condition and results from operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, two customers accounted for approximately 37% or $1,753,000 of our total revenues. If these customers were to significantly reduce its relationship with the Company, or in the event the Company is unable to replace the revenue through the sale of its products to additional customers, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results from operations could be negatively impacted, and such impact would be material.\nWe occasionally rely on systems integrators to manage our large projects, and if these companies do not perform adequately, we may lose business.\nWe occasionally act as a subcontractor to systems integrators who manage large projects that incorporate our systems, particularly in foreign countries. We cannot control these companies, and they may decide not to promote our products or may price their services in such a way as to make it unprofitable for us to continue our relationship with them. Further, they may fail to perform under agreements with their customers, in which case we might lose sales to these customers. If we lose our relationships with these companies, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nIf the patents we own or license, or our other intellectual property rights, do not adequately protect our products and technologies, we may lose market share to our competitors and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur success depends significantly on our ability to protect our rights to the technologies used in our products. We rely on patent protection, trade secrets, as well as a combination of copyright and trademark laws and nondisclosure, confidentiality and other contractual arrangements to protect our technology. However, these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. In addition, we cannot be assured that any of our current and future pending patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent to us. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cPTO\u201d) may deny or require significant narrowing of claims in our pending patent applications, and patents issued as a result of the pending patent applications, if any, may not provide us with significant commercial protection or may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. We could also incur substantial costs in proceedings before the PTO. These proceedings could result in adverse decisions as to the claims included in our patents.\nOur issued and licensed patents and those that may be issued or licensed in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products. Additionally, upon expiration of our issued or licensed patents, we may lose some of our rights to exclude others from making, using, selling or importing products using the technology based on the expired patents. We also must rely on contractual rights with the third parties that license technology to us to protect our rights in the technology licensed to us. Although we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and technology, there is no assurance that competitors will not be able to design around our patents. We also rely on unpatented proprietary technology. We cannot assure you that we can meaningfully protect all our rights in our unpatented proprietary technology or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary products or processes or otherwise gain access to our unpatented proprietary technology. We seek to protect our know-how and other unpatented proprietary technology with confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees. However, such agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements or in the event that our competitors discover or independently develop similar or identical designs or other proprietary information. In addition, we rely on the use of registered and common law trademarks with respect to the brand names of some of our products. Our common law trademarks provide less protection than our registered trademarks. Loss of rights in our trademarks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If we fail to apply for intellectual property protection or if we cannot adequately protect our intellectual property rights in these foreign countries, our competitors may be able to compete more effectively against us, which could adversely affect our competitive position, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf third parties claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights, we may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue selling certain products.\nWhether a product infringes a patent involves complex legal and factual issues, the determination of which is often uncertain. We face the risk of claims that we have infringed on third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. Searching for existing intellectual property rights may not reveal important intellectual property and our competitors may also have filed for patent protection, which is not yet a matter of public knowledge, or claimed trademark rights that have not been revealed through our availability searches. Our efforts to identify and avoid infringing on third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights may not always be successful. Any claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could:\n\u25cf\nincrease the cost of our products;\n\u25cf\nbe expensive and time consuming to defend;\n\u25cf\nresult in us being required to pay significant damages to third parties;\n\u25cf\nforce us to cease making or selling products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u25cf\nrequire us to redesign, reengineer or rebrand our products;\n\u25cf\nrequire us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party\u2019s intellectual property, the terms of which may not be acceptable to us;\n\u25cf\nrequire us to indemnify third parties pursuant to contracts in which we have agreed to provide indemnification to such parties for intellectual property infringement claims;\n\u25cf\ndivert the attention of our management; and\n\u25cf\nresult in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of the affected products until the litigation is resolved.\nIn addition, new patents obtained by our competitors could threaten a product\u2019s continued life in the market even after it has already been introduced.\nWe operate in foreign countries and are exposed to risks associated with foreign political, economic and legal environments and with foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe have significant foreign operations. As a result, we are exposed to risks, including among others, risks associated with foreign political, economic and legal environments and with foreign currency exchange rates. Our results may be adversely affected by, among other things, changes in government policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflation measures, currency conversions, collection of receivables abroad and rates and methods of taxation.\nWe depend on key personnel, the loss of any of whom could materially adversely affect future operations.\nOur success will depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and other key personnel. The loss of the services of one or more of these key employees and any negative market or industry perception arising from the loss of such services could have a material adverse effect on us and the trading price of our Common Stock. Our business will also be dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Acquiring and keeping these personnel could prove more difficult or cost substantially more than estimated and we cannot be certain that we will be able to retain such personnel or attract a high caliber of personnel in the future.\nWe face competition from companies with greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources, and, if we are unable to compete effectively with these competitors, our market share may decline and our business could be harmed.\nWe face competition from other established companies. A number of our competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, significantly greater financial, technological, sales, marketing and other resources than we do. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or client requirements, more quickly develop new products or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services than we can. Likewise, their greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns in the identity management solutions industry and compete more effectively on the basis of price and production. In addition, new companies may enter the markets in which we compete, further increasing competition in the identity management solutions industry.\nWe believe that our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including the type and quality of our products and the strength of our brand names, as well as many factors beyond our control. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors, and increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced profit margins, loss of market share and an inability to generate cash flows that are sufficient to maintain or expand the development and marketing of new products, any of which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nOur Common Stock is subject to \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules.\nOur Common Stock is currently defined as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under Rule 3a51-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act. \u201cPenny stocks\u201d are subject to Rules 15g-2 through 15g-7 and Rule 15g-9, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and institutional accredited investors. Among other things, for transactions covered by these rules, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. Consequently, these rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our Common Stock and affect the ability of holders to sell their shares of our Common Stock in the secondary market. To the extent our Common Stock is subject to the penny stock regulations, the market liquidity for our shares will be adversely affected.\nOur stock price has been volatile, and your investment in our Common Stock could suffer a decline in value.\nThere has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities, which is unrelated to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities. These broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our Common Stock. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you pay for those shares due to fluctuations in the market price of our Common Stock caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects and other factors.\nSome specific factors that may have a significant effect on our Common Stock market price include:\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or future prospects;\n\u25cf\nour announcements or our competitors\u2019 announcements of new products;\n\u25cf\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d);\n\u25cf\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u25cf\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u25cf\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our growth rates or our competitors\u2019 growth rates;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments regarding our patents or proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf\nour inability to raise additional capital as needed;\n\u25cf\nsubstantial sales of Common Stock underlying warrants and preferred stock;\n\u25cf\nconcern as to the efficacy of our products;\n\u25cf\nchanges in financial markets or general economic conditions;\n\u25cf\nsales of Common Stock by us or members of our management team; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding our Common Stock, other comparable companies or our industry generally.\nOur future sales of our Common Stock could adversely affect its price and our future capital-raising activities could involve the issuance of equity securities, which would dilute shareholders\u2019 investments and could result in a decline in the trading price of our Common Stock.\nWe may sell securities in the public or private equity markets if and when conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time. Sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Common Stock and our ability to raise capital. We may issue additional Common Stock in future financing transactions or as incentive compensation for our executive management and other key personnel, consultants and advisors. Issuing any equity securities would be dilutive to the equity interests represented by our then-outstanding shares of Common Stock. The market price for our Common Stock could decrease as the market takes into account the dilutive effect of any of these issuances. Furthermore, we may enter into financing transactions at prices that represent a substantial discount to the market price of our Common Stock. A negative reaction by investors and securities analysts to any discounted sale of our equity securities could result in a decline in the trading price of our Common Stock.\nThe holders of our preferred stock have certain rights and privileges that are senior to our Common Stock, and we may issue additional shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval that could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the Common Stock.\nOur Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) has the authority to issue a total of up to four million shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions, including voting rights, of the preferred stock, which typically are senior to the rights of the Common Stockholders, without any further vote or action by the Common Stockholders. The rights of our Common Stockholders will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of the preferred stock that have been issued, or might be issued in the future. Preferred stock also could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. This could delay, defer, or prevent a change in control. Furthermore, holders of preferred stock may have other rights, including economic rights, senior to the Common Stock. As a result, their existence and issuance could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the Common Stock. We have in the past issued and may from time to time in the future issue, preferred stock for financing or other purposes with rights, preferences, or privileges senior to the Common Stock. As of December 31, 2015, we had two series of preferred stock outstanding, Series B Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries B Preferred\u201d) and Series E Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries E Preferred\u201d).\nThe provisions of our Series B Preferred prohibit the payment of dividends on our Common Stock unless the dividends on our preferred shares are first paid. In addition, upon a liquidation, dissolution or sale of our business, the holders of our Series B Preferred will be entitled to receive, in preference to any distribution to the holders of Common Stock, initial distributions of $2.50 per share, plus all accrued but unpaid dividends. As of December 31, 2015, we had cumulative undeclared dividends on our Series B Preferred of approximately $8,000.\nThe provisions of our Series E Preferred prohibit the payment of dividends on our Common Stock unless the dividends on our preferred shares are first paid. In addition, upon a liquidation, dissolution or sale of our business, the holders of our Series E Preferred will be entitled to receive, in preference to any distribution to the holders of Common Stock, initial distributions of $1,000 per share, plus all accrued but unpaid dividends. At December 31, 2015, we had accrued $240,000 in Series E Preferred dividends for the period October 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015. Such amounts were paid in January 2016.\nCertain large shareholders may have certain personal interests that may affect the Company.\nAs a result of the shares issued to Goldman Capital Management and related entities controlled by Neal Goldman, a member of our Board of Directors (together, \u201cGoldman\u201d), Goldman beneficially owns, in the aggregate, approximately 36.6% of the Company\u2019s outstanding voting securities. As a result, Goldman has the potential ability to exert influence over both the actions of the Board of Directors and the outcome of issues requiring approval by the Company\u2019s shareholders. This concentration of ownership may have effects such as delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company that may be favored by other shareholders or preventing transactions in which shareholders might otherwise recover a premium for their shares over current market prices.\nOur corporate documents and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable. For example, our certificate of incorporation authorizes preferred stock, which carries special rights, including voting and dividend rights. With these rights, preferred stockholders could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us.\nWe are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Under these provisions, if anyone becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d we may not enter into a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with that person for three years without special approval, which could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change of control. For purposes of Section 203, \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d means, generally, someone owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours that owned 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock during the past three years, subject to certain exceptions as described in Section 203.\nWe do not expect to pay cash dividends on our Common Stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our Common Stock and do not anticipate that any cash dividends will be paid on the Common Stock for the foreseeable future. The payment of any cash dividend by us will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, capital, regulatory requirements and financial condition. Furthermore, the terms of our Series B Preferred and Series E Preferred directly limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our Common Stock.", "PERMNO": 88213, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "IWSY"}
