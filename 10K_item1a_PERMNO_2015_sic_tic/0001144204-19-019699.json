{"cik": "1425565", "company": "Real Goods Solar, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-04-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe wish to caution you that there are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those indicated by forward looking statements that we make from time to time in filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, news releases, reports, proxy statements, registration statements and other written communications, as well as oral forward-looking statements made from time to time by our representatives. These risks and uncertainties include those risks described below of which we are presently aware. Historical results are not necessarily an indication of the future results. Cautionary statements below discuss important factors that could cause our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows to be materially adversely affected.\nRisk Factors Related to our Business and Industry\nWe have a history of operating losses, and it is uncertain when, or if, we may be able to achieve or sustain future profitability. If we do not become profitable on an ongoing basis, we may be unable to continue our operations.\nWe have incurred net losses and have an accumulated deficit of $243 million as of December 31, 2018. If we cannot improve our operating results and ultimately generate net income, we may be unable to continue our operations in the future.\nOur financial statements as of December 31, 2018 were prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. The independent registered public accounting firm that audited our 2018 financial statements, in their report, included an explanatory paragraph referring to our recurring losses and expressed substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern. Management also concluded that substantial doubt exists in our ability to continue as a going concern, and our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Our ability to continue as a going concern depends on our ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing, increase sales and installations, attain further operating efficiencies, reduce expenditures, and ultimately, to generate revenue.\nWe need to successfully commercialize POWERHOUSE\u2122 or increase our sales, installations and revenue in order to achieve our goal of operating profitability.\nOur current levels of sales, installations and revenue are insufficient for profitable operations. We believe we must commercialize POWERHOUSE\u2122 3.0, the principle component of our revenue growth strategy, to achieve our goal of operating profitably. Alternatively, we must increase our sales, installations and revenue in our Solar Division to achieve our goal of operating profitably. If we are unsuccessful in executing these plans, we will be unable to increase revenue and will not achieve our goal of operating profitability.\nWe have a history of negative cash flows from operations, and it is uncertain when, or if, in the future we will be able to achieve or sustain positive cash flow from operations.\nThere can be no assurance in the future that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain funds from future financings or other sources to fund operations or other liquidity needs which could have important adverse consequences to us, such as:\n\u00b7 limiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u00b7 making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to future indebtedness;\n\u00b7 limiting our ability to respond to changing business, industry and economic conditions and to withstand competitive pressures, which may affect our financial condition;\n\u00b7 limiting our ability to make investments, dispose of assets, pay cash dividends or repurchase stock;\n\u00b7 increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, our industry or the general economy and restricting us from making improvements or acquisitions or exploring business opportunities; and\n\u00b7 placing us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors with greater resources\nOur future operating performance and our ability to service indebtedness will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nExisting rules, regulations and policies pertaining to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation and changes to these regulations and policies may deter the purchase and use of solar energy systems and negatively impact development of the solar energy industry.\nThe market for solar energy systems is heavily influenced by foreign, federal, state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry, as well as policies adopted by electric utilities. These regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation. For example, the vast majority of states have a regulatory policy known as net energy metering, or \u201cnet metering\u201d, which allows our customers to interconnect their on-site solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit at the utility\u2019s retail rate for energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid and not consumed on-site. In this way, the customer pays for the net energy used or receives a credit at the retail rate if more electricity is produced than consumed. In some states, net metering is being replaced with lower credits for the excess electricity sent onto the grid from solar energy systems, and utilities are imposing minimum or fixed monthly charges on owners of solar energy systems. These regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified in the future in ways that can restrict the interconnection of solar energy systems and deter purchases of solar energy systems by customers. In addition, electricity generated by solar energy systems competes most favorably in markets with tiered rate structures or peak hour pricing that increase the price of electricity when more is consumed. Modifications to these rate structures by utilities, such as reducing peak hour or tiered pricing or adopting flat rate pricing, could require the price of solar energy systems to be reduced in order to compete with the price of utility generated electricity.\nThe reduction, elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy systems could reduce the demand for our products and services.\nU.S. federal, state and local government bodies and utilities provide incentives to end-users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar electricity in the form of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments and payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation. These incentives enable us to lower the price we charge our customers for solar energy systems. However, these incentives may expire on a particular date, end when the allocated funding is exhausted, or be reduced or terminated as solar energy adoption rates increase. These reductions or terminations often occur without warning. In addition, applicable authorities may adjust or decrease incentives from time to time or include provisions for minimum domestic content requirements or other requirements to qualify for these incentives. The reduction, elimination or expiration of such incentives or delays or interruptions in the implementation of favorable federal or state laws could substantially increase the cost of our systems to our customers, resulting in a significant reduction in demand for our solar energy systems, which would negatively impact our business.\nExisting regulations, and changes to such regulations, may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the installation of solar energy systems, which may significantly reduce demand for our solar energy systems.\nThe installation of solar energy systems is subject to oversight and regulation under local ordinances; building, zoning and fire codes; environmental protection regulation; utility interconnection requirements for metering; and other rules and regulations. We attempt to keep up-to-date on these requirements on a national, state and local level and must design and install our solar energy systems to comply with varying standards. Certain jurisdictions may have ordinances that prevent or increase the cost of installation of our solar energy systems. In addition, new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to the installation of solar energy systems are unpredictable and may result in significant additional expenses or delays, which could cause a significant reduction in demand for solar energy systems.\nAn increase in our cost of materials could arise as a result of the United States imposing trade remedies on imported solar panels, cells, inverters, batteries or other products related to our business.\nDuring 2018, the United States and China each imposed new tariffs on various products imported from the other country. The U.S. tariffs include an additional 25% tariff on solar panels and cells that are manufactured in China and a tariff on inverters, certain batteries and other electrical equipment currently set at 25% effective January 1, 2019. The United States also has, from time to time, imposed, or announced tariffs on goods imported from other countries we use in our business. We cannot predict what actions may ultimately be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the United States and other countries, what products may be subject to such actions, or what actions may be taken by the other countries in retaliation. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact our supply chain, our costs, our suppliers, and the U.S. economy, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nAn increase in our cost of materials could arise as a result of changes in the price of oil and the foreign currency exchange rate for Chinese yuan.\nThe baseplate of our POWERHOUSE\u2122 in-roof solar shingle is plastic and, accordingly, changes in the price of oil will affect our cost of this material. Currently, we purchase the solar laminate for our POWERHOUSE\u2122 in-roof solar shingle from a Chinese manufacturer, and, accordingly, changes in the Chinese yuan verses the US Dollar will affect our cost of this material.\nAlthough currently there is no shortage of supplies for solar energy systems, from time to time in the past, shortages have occurred and have impacted solar companies such as us. Shortages in the supply of silicon and inverters or supply chain issues could adversely affect the availability and cost of the solar photovoltaic modules used in our solar energy systems.\nShortages of silicon and inverters or supply chain issues could adversely affect the availability and cost of our solar energy systems. Manufacturers of photovoltaic modules depend upon the availability and pricing of silicon, one of the primary materials used in photovoltaic modules. The worldwide market for silicon from time to time experiences a shortage of supply, which can cause the prices for photovoltaic modules to increase and supplies to become difficult to obtain. While we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of solar photovoltaic modules to satisfy our needs to date, this may not be the case in the future. Future increases in the price of silicon or other materials and components could result in an increase in costs to us, price increases to our customers or reduced margins.\nOther international trade conditions such as work slowdowns and labor strikes at port facilities or major weather events can also adversely impact the availability and price of solar photovoltaic modules.\nOur business prospects could be harmed if solar energy is not widely adopted or sufficient demand for solar energy systems does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate.\nThe solar energy market is at a relatively early stage of development. The extent to which solar energy will be widely adopted and the extent to which demand for solar energy systems will increase are uncertain. If solar energy does not achieve widespread adoption or demand for solar energy systems fails to develop sufficiently, we may be unable to achieve our revenue and profit targets. In addition, demand for solar energy systems in our targeted markets may not develop or may develop to a lesser extent or more slowly than we anticipate. Many factors may affect the demand for solar energy systems, including the following:\n\u00b7 availability of government and utility company subsidies and incentives to support the development of the solar energy industry;\n\u00b7 government and utility policies regarding the interconnection of solar energy systems to the utility grid;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in economic and market conditions that affect the viability of conventional and non-solar renewable energy sources, such as changes in the price of natural gas and other fossil fuels;\n\u00b7 cost-effectiveness (including the cost of solar panels), performance and reliability of solar energy systems compared with conventional and other non-solar renewable energy sources and products;\n\u00b7 success of other renewable energy generation technologies, such as hydroelectric, wind, geothermal, solar thermal, concentrated solar and biomass;\n\u00b7 availability of customer financing with economically attractive terms;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in expenditures by purchasers of solar energy systems, which tend to decrease in slower economic environments and periods of rising interest rates and tighter credit; and\n\u00b7 deregulation of the electric power industry and the broader energy industry.\nA drop in the retail price of conventional electricity or non-solar renewable energy sources may negatively impact our business.\nThe demand for our solar energy systems depends in part on the price of conventional electricity, which affects return on investment resulting from the purchase of solar energy systems. Fluctuations in economic and market conditions that impact the prices of conventional and non-solar renewable energy sources could cause the demand for solar energy systems to decline, which would have a negative impact on our business.\nOur sales and installations are subject to seasonality of customer demand and weather conditions which are outside of our control.\nOur sales are subject to the seasonality of when customers buy solar energy systems. We historically have experienced spikes in orders during the spring and summer months which, due to lead time, result in installations and revenue increasing during the summer and fall. Tax incentives can generate additional backlog prior to the end of the year, depending upon the incentives available and whether customers are looking to take advantage of such incentives before the end of the year.\nOur ability to construct systems outdoors may be impacted by inclement weather, which can be most prominent in our geographic installation regions during the first and fourth quarters of the year. As a result of these factors, our first quarter is generally our slowest quarter of the year. If unexpected natural events occur and we are unable to manage our cash flow through these seasonal factors, there could be a negative impact on our financial position, liquidity, results of operations and cash flow.\nOur inability to respond to changing technologies and issues presented by new technologies could harm our business.\nThe solar energy industry is subject to technological change. If we rely on products and technologies that cease to be attractive to customers, or if we are unable to respond appropriately to changing technologies and changes in product function or quality, we may not be successful in capturing or retaining significant market share. In addition, any new technologies utilized in our solar energy systems may not perform as expected or as desired, in which event our adoption of such products or technologies may harm our business.\nWe may be unable to successfully commercialize POWERHOUSE\u2122 3.0, which may negatively impact our business and results of operation.\nThere are risks we must address to successfully commercialize POWERHOUSE\u2122 3.0:\n\u00b7 The adequacy of, and access to, capital necessary to commercialize POWERHOUSE\u2122 3.0;\n\u00b7 Our ability to satisfy the conditions and our obligations under the License;\n\u00b7 Our ability to grow a nationwide network of local roofers and solar installers to purchase POWERHOUSE\u2122 solar shingles;\n\u00b7 Our ability to contract with homebuilders to purchase POWERHOUSE\u2122 solar shingles for their communities;\n\u00b7 Our ability to manage a supply chain, including the cost and availability of raw materials, in order to achieve production levels and competitive pricing of the POWERHOUSE\u2122 3.0 shingles;\n\u00b7 Our ability to successfully expand operations and realize profitable revenue growth from the sale and installation of POWERHOUSE\u2122 3.0;\n\u00b7 Our ability to successfully and timely expand our POWERHOUSE\u2122 3.0 business outside of the United States and manage foreign exchange risks associated with the POWERHOUSE\u2122 3.0 business;\n\u00b7 Intellectual property infringement claims, and warranty claims related to the POWERHOUSE\u2122 3.0 business; and\n\u00b7 Competition in the built-in photovoltaic solar system business.\nOur License with Dow for the exclusive use of the POWERHOUSE\u2122 trademark name is subject to our selling of 50 megawatts of POWERHOUSE\u2122 3.0 in-roof shingle within the first 5 years and failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nIf we do not sell 50 megawatts of POWERHOUSE\u2122 3.0 in-roof shingles during the first 5 years after obtaining UL certification, Dow has the right to amend the License to be non-exclusive. If that were to happen, Dow would be allowed to grant rights to others to sell POWERHOUSE\u2122 3.0 in-roof solar shingles and use associated intellectual property, thereby increasing competition, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nOur Solar Division operates in a highly competitive market with low barriers to entry and, accordingly, we may face the loss of business or reduced margins.\nThe solar energy system installation market is highly competitive with low barriers to entry. We currently compete with significantly larger companies as well as a large number of relatively small installers and developers. Larger companies may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition than we do. Smaller companies may lack adequate systems and capital but can benefit from operating efficiencies or from having lower overhead, which enables them to offer lower prices.\nWe believe that our Solar Division\u2019s ability to compete depends in part on a number of factors outside of our control, including the following:\n\u00b7 the availability of solar financing solutions;\n\u00b7 the price at which competitors offer comparable products;\n\u00b7 marketing efforts undertaken by our competitors;\n\u00b7 the extent of our competitors\u2019 responsiveness to customer needs; and\n\u00b7 access to materials, labor and installation services.\nCompetition in the solar energy system installation market may increase in the future as a result of low barriers to entry. Increased industry competition could result in reductions in price, margins, and market share and in greater competition for qualified personnel. Our business and operating results would be adversely affected if we are unable to compete effectively.\nWe derive the majority of the revenue from the sale of solar energy systems in east coast states.\nWe currently derive the vast majority of our Solar Division revenue from the sale of solar energy systems in east coast states. This geographic concentration exposes us to increased risks associated with the growth rates, government regulations, economic conditions, weather and other factors that may be specific to those states to which we would be less subject if we were more geographically diversified. We intend to expand our Solar Division into new states of operation. Any geographic expansion efforts that we may make may not be successful, which would limit our growth opportunities.\nOur Board of Directors has concluded that we will exit our mainland residential business and we may not generate the cost savings we expect.\nOn March 27, 2019, our Board of Directors determined to exit our mainland residential solar business to focus on the POWERHOUSE\u2122 in-roof shingle market and reduce overall cash outflow. This realignment is expected to result in the reduction of workforce payroll plus burden of approximately $4.0 million annually. Revenues and net loss in 2018 for the mainland residential solar business were approximately $8.9 million and $6.3 million, respectively. In order for us to convert our existing backlog to revenue, we plan to use authorized integrators to complete installations throughout the remainder of 2019. These projected cost savings may not be attained, and we may not be successful at converting our existing backlog into revenue utilizing authorized integrators.\nOur Solar Division installs solar energy systems, and many factors can prevent us from completing installations on time or on budget.\nFactors that may prevent us from completing installations on time or on budget include:\n\u00b7 shortages of materials;\n\u00b7 shortages of skilled labor;\n\u00b7 unforeseen installation scheduling, engineering, excavation, environmental or geological problems;\n\u00b7 job site issues that were not apparent during site inspection;\n\u00b7 natural disasters, hurricanes, weather interference, fires, earthquakes or other casualty losses or delays;\n\u00b7 delays in obtaining or inability to obtain or maintain necessary licenses or permits;\n\u00b7 changes to plans or specifications;\n\u00b7 performance by subcontractors;\n\u00b7 disputes with subcontractors; and\n\u00b7 unanticipated cost increases in materials, labor or other elements of our projects beyond budgets and allowances for contingencies.\nOur installation projects expose us to risks of cost overruns due to typical uncertainties associated with any project or changes in the designs, plans or concepts of such projects. For these and other reasons, installation costs may exceed the estimated cost of completions.\nAvailability and cost of financing for solar energy systems could reduce demand for our services and products.\nMany of our Solar Division customers, and prospective customers of our POWERHOUSE\u2122 roofers and homebuilders, depend on loan financing to fund the purchase price of our solar energy systems. The interest rate for this financing varies with market conditions. Third-party financing sources may also charge significant fees for their financing products. If financing sources increase their fees or interest rates, the cost of purchasing our solar energy systems will increase and we may experience decreased demand for our products and services, resulting in reduced revenue. In the alternative, if we elect to absorb any financing price increase by lowering the price of our products and services to keep the total cost to our customers constant, our revenue will decrease, and we will experience lower profit margins. However, we continue to rely on third parties to finance most of our sales of solar energy systems in our Solar Division and we expect that prospective customers of our POWERHOUSE\u2122 roofers similarly will rely on third parties to finance their purchases.\nAn increase in interest rates or tight credit markets could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of solar energy systems and could reduce demand for our services and products.\nSome of our prospective customers may depend on debt financing, such as home equity loans or leasing, to fund the purchase of a solar energy system. Third-party financing sources, specifically for solar energy systems, are currently limited. The lack of financing sources, limitations on available credit, or an increase in interest rates could make it difficult or too costly for our potential customers to secure the financing necessary to purchase a solar energy system on favorable terms, or at all, thus lowering demand for our services and products and negatively impacting our business.\nWe may incur fines and other penalties if we do not conduct our business in accordance with licenses required for our operations and if any such license is suspended or lost, we may be unable to sell or install solar energy systems in the jurisdiction in question and our sales and revenue from that jurisdiction would be adversely affected.\nAs a construction company, we are required to hold general or specialty contractors\u2019 licenses in some of the jurisdictions in which we operate, although in other jurisdictions we are permitted to utilize the licenses of subcontractors. Some jurisdictions also require licenses to sell home improvement products or services, or to issue consumer credit. If we violate the rules of these licensing authorities, we may incur fines or other penalties or have our licenses suspended or cancelled. Some licenses require us to employ personnel with specific qualifications. If we lose those personnel, we may lose our ability to conduct business in that jurisdiction until we can hire a qualified replacement.\nWe may be subject to unexpected warranty expenses or service claims that could reduce our profits.\nOur currently standard manufacturing warranty for our POWERHOUSE\u2122 3.0 solar shingles comes with an 11-year product warranty, which is the standard product warranty of most traditional solar panels today, and a 24-year power production warranty.\nOur Solar Division provides warranties for workmanship and, in certain cases, in energy production and, accordingly we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have completed the installation of a solar energy system. Our current standard warranty for our installation services includes a warranty period of up to 10 years for defective workmanship. In addition, most manufacturers of solar photovoltaic modules offer a 25-year warranty period for declines in power performance.\nAlthough we maintain an estimated liability for potential warranty or service claims, claims in excess of our recorded liability could adversely affect our operating results. Our failure to predict accurately future warranty claims could result in unexpected volatility in our financial results.\nWe rely heavily on a limited number of suppliers, installers and other vendors, and if these companies were unable to deliver critical components and services, it would adversely affect our ability to operate and our financial results.\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers to provide the components used in our POWERHOUSE\u2122 in-roof solar shingles and our solar energy systems. We also rely on key vendors to provide internal and external services which are critical to our operations, including installation of solar energy systems, accounting and customer relationship management software, facilities and communications. The failure of our suppliers and vendors to supply us with products and services in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms could result in lost orders, delay our project schedules, limit our ability to operate and harm our financial results. If any of our suppliers or vendors were to fail to supply our needs on a timely basis or to cease providing us key components or services we use, we would be required to secure alternative sources of supply. We may have difficulty securing alternative sources of supply. If this were to occur, our business would be harmed.\nThe installation and ongoing operation of solar energy systems involves significant safety risks.\nSolar energy systems generate electricity, which is inherently dangerous. Installation of these systems also involves the risk of falling from rooftops, personal injuries occurring at the job site and other risks typical of construction projects. Although we take many steps to assure the safe installation and operation of our solar energy systems, and maintain insurance against such liabilities, we may nevertheless be exposed to significant losses arising from personal injuries or property damage arising from our projects.\nOur failure to meet customer expectations in the performance of our services, and the risks and liabilities associated with placing our employees and technicians in our customers\u2019 homes and businesses, could give rise to claims against us.\nOur failure or inability to meet customer expectations in the performance of our services could damage our reputation or result in claims against us. In addition, we are subject to various risks and liabilities associated with our employees and technicians providing installation services in the homes and businesses of our customers, including possible claims of errors and omissions, harassment, theft of customer property, criminal activity and other claims.\nProduct liability claims against us could result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages.\nAs a seller of consumer products, we may face product liability claims in the event that use of our solar energy systems results in injuries. Because solar energy systems produce electricity, it is possible that our products could result in injury, whether by product malfunctions, defects, improper installation or other causes. If such injuries or claims of injuries were to occur, we could incur monetary damages and our business could be adversely affected by any resulting negative publicity. The successful assertion of product liability claims against us also could result in potentially significant monetary damages and, if our insurance protection is inadequate to cover these claims, could require us to make significant payments from our own resources.\nOur operations are largely dependent on the skill and experience of our management and key personnel. The loss of management and other key personnel or our inability to hire additional personnel could significantly harm our business and our ability to expand, and we may not be able to effectively replace members of management who have left the company.\nOur continued success and our ability to maintain our competitive position is largely dependent upon, among other things, the efforts and skills of our senior executives and management team. We cannot guarantee that these individuals will remain with us. Further, we do not carry key man life insurance on our executives. If we lose the services of any members of our management team or other key personnel, our business may be significantly impaired. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract additional qualified senior executive, management and key personnel.\nThe loss of personnel or failure to hire additional personnel could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and our ability to expand.\nThe expansion of our business could significantly strain our managerial, financial and personnel resources. To reach our goals, we must successfully recruit, train, motivate and retain additional employees, including management and technical personnel, integrate new employees into our overall operations and enhance our financial and accounting systems, controls and reporting systems. While we believe we have personnel sufficient for the current requirements of our business, expansion of our business could require us to employ additional personnel. The loss of personnel or our failure to hire additional personnel could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and our ability to expand.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation which, if adversely determined, could cause us to incur substantial losses.\nFrom time to time during the normal course of operating our businesses, we are subject to various litigation claims and legal disputes. As a result, we might also be required to incur significant legal fees, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position. In addition, because we cannot accurately predict the outcome of any action, it is possible that, as a result of current and/or future litigation, we will be subject to adverse judgments or settlements that could significantly reduce our earnings or result in losses.\nIncreased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services.\nWe rely on technology, computer systems, third-party service providers, and our website for obtaining and storing certain information. Our business requires us to receive, retain and transmit personally identifiable information and other information about our customers, suppliers and employees, some of which is entrusted to third-party service providers and other businesses we interact with. Information technology security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Our security measures have been breached in an immaterial manner in the past and may be breached in the future due to a cyber-attack, computer malware or viruses, employee error, malfeasance, fraudulent inducement (including so-called \u201csocial engineering\u201d attacks and \u201cphishing\u201d scams) or other acts. Costs associated with our past security breach have not been significant. Unauthorized parties have previously obtained and may in the future obtain access to our data or the data of our customers, suppliers or employees or may otherwise cause damage or interfere with our technology, computer systems or website. We develop and update processes and maintain systems in an effort to try to prevent this from occurring and seek assurances from businesses we interact with that they will do the same, but the development and maintenance of these processes and systems are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change, privacy and information security regulations change, and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. We have taken, and continue to undertake significant steps to protect such information and seek assurances from businesses we interact with that they will do the same, but there can be no assurance that our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with will not be compromised, and such compromise could result in such information being obtained by unauthorized persons, adverse operational effects or interruptions, substantial additional costs or being subject to legal or regulatory proceedings, any of which could damage our reputation in the marketplace or materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWhile we are exploring and evaluating strategic alternatives, we may not be successful in identifying or completing any strategic alternative and any such strategic alternative may not yield additional value for shareholders.\nOn March 7, 2019, we announced that we had commenced a review of strategic alternatives which could result in, among other things, the possible sale of the Company. Our exploration of strategic alternatives may not result in the identification or consummation of any transaction. In addition, we may incur substantial expenses associated with identifying and evaluating potential strategic alternatives. The process of exploring strategic alternatives may be time consuming and disruptive to our business operations, and if we are unable to effectively manage the process, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Any potential transaction and the related valuation would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among other factors, market conditions, industry trends, the interest of third parties in our business and the availability of financing to potential buyers on reasonable terms.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Securities\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been volatile, and future volatility could result in substantial losses for investors.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been volatile in the past and could fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated changes in our operating results;\n\u00b7 regulatory, legislative or other developments affecting us or the solar energy industry generally;\n\u00b7 changes in expectations relating to our services and products, plans and strategic position or those of our competitors or customers;\n\u00b7 market conditions and trends within the solar energy industry;\n\u00b7 acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or by our competitors;\n\u00b7 litigation involving us, our industry or both;\n\u00b7 introductions of new technological innovations, services, products or pricing policies by us or by our competitors;\n\u00b7 recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7 our ability to execute our business plan;\n\u00b7 volume and timing of customer orders;\n\u00b7 price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u00b7 changes in investor perception;\n\u00b7 the level and quality of any research analyst coverage of our Class A common stock;\n\u00b7 changes in earnings estimates or investment recommendations by analysts;\n\u00b7 the financial guidance we may provide to the public, any changes in such guidance or its failure to meet such guidance;\n\u00b7\nthe trading volume of our Class A common stock;\n\u00b7 short-term investment in our Class A common stock by investors;\n\u00b7 our issuance of additional Class A common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for Class A common stock; and\n\u00b7 economic and other external factors that impact purchasing decisions of our potential customers.\nFuture volatility of the market price of our Class A common stock could result in substantial losses for investors.\nFuture issuances of stock, options, warrants or other securities will cause substantial dilution and may negatively affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nOwnership of our securities may be diluted by future issuances of securities or the conversion or exercise of outstanding or to be issued options, warrants, convertible notes, convertible stock or other securities.\nAs of April 10, 2019, there were an aggregate of approximately 29 million shares of our Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants. The exercise price under certain of our outstanding warrants is subject to adjustment in the future.\nDerivative securities, such as convertible debt, options and warrants, currently outstanding or issued in the future may contain anti-dilution protection provisions, which, if triggered, could require us to issue a larger number of the security underlying such derivative security than the face amount.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales or issuance of shares of our Class A common stock into the market, or the availability of shares of our Class A common stock for future sale, will have on the market price of our Class A common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock (including shares issued upon exercise of options and warrants or conversion of convertible related party debt), or the perception that such sales could occur, may materially affect prevailing market prices for our Class A common stock.\nOur common stock could become subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d regulations, which may limit the liquidity of Class A common stock held by our shareholders.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which generally define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. Based on our Class A common stock\u2019s trading price below $5.00 per share, if we are unable in the future to continue to satisfy an available exemption from the definition of \u201cpenny stock\u201d, then our Class A common stock would be considered a penny stock for purposes of federal securities laws.
