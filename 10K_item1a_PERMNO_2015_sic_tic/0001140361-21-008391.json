Several of these risks and uncertainties, are discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This listing should not be considered as all-inclusive. These factors represent risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Other risks that we do not know about now, or that we do not believe are significant, could negatively impact our business or the trading price of our securities. In addition to common business risks such as theft, loss of market share and disasters, the Company is subject to special types of risk due to the nature of its business. See additional discussions about credit, interest rate, market, and litigation risks in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d section of this Form 10-K beginning on page 19 and additional information regarding legislative and regulatory risks in the \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d section beginning on page 43.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures intended to prevent its spread could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition, and such efforts will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict.\nIn December 2019, a novel coronavirus was reported in China, and, in March 2020 the World Health Organization declared a pandemic. On March 12, 2020, the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States a national emergency. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant economic dislocation in the United States as many state and local governments have ordered non-essential businesses to close and residents to shelter in place at home. This has resulted in an unprecedented slow-down in economic activity and a related increase in unemployment. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, millions of people have filed claims for unemployment, and stock markets have fluctuated in value and, in particular, bank stocks have significantly declined in value. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Federal Reserve Board has reduced the benchmark federal funds rate to a target range of 0% to 0.25% and yields on 10 and 30-year treasury notes have declined to historic lows. The federal banking agencies have encouraged financial institutions to prudently work with affected borrowers and passed legislature to provide relief from reporting loan classifications due to modifications related to the COVID-19 outbreak.\nFinally, the spread of coronavirus has caused us to modify our business practices, including employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participations in meetings, events, and conferences. We may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, clients, and business partners. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or will otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities. In addition, the success of our operations substantially depends on the management skills of our executive officers and directors, many of whom have held officer and director positions with us for many years. The unanticipated loss or unavailability of key employees due to the outbreak could harm our ability to operate our business or execute our business strategy.\nGiven the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business. The United States government has taken steps to attempt to mitigate some of the more severe anticipated economic effects of the virus, including the passage of the CARES Act, but there can be no assurance that such steps will be effective or achieve their desired results in a timely fashion. The extent of such impact from the COVID-19 outbreak and related mitigation efforts will depend on future developments, which remain uncertain, including but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. As the result, we could be subject to any of the following risks, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations:\n\u2022\ndemand for our products and services may decline, making it difficult to grow assets and income;\n\u2022\nif the economy is unable to substantially reopen, and high levels of unemployment continue for an extended period of time, loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase, resulting in increased charges and reduced income;\n\u2022\ncollateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, which could cause loan losses to increase;\n\u2022\nour allowance for loan losses may have to be increased if borrowers experience financial difficulties beyond forbearance periods, which will adversely affect our net income;\n\u2022\nthe net worth and liquidity of our loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us;\nIndex\n\u2022\nas the result of the decline in the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s target federal funds rate, the yield on our assets may decline to greater extent than the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, reducing our net interest margin and spread and reducing our income;\n\u2022\na material decrease in net income or a net loss over several quarters could result in a decrease in the rate of our quarterly cash dividend;\n\u2022\nan increase in information security risk, with exploitation of clients and added risks of remote work;\n\u2022\nwe rely on third party vendors for certain services and the unavailability of a critical service due to the COVID-19 outbreak could have an adverse effect on us; and\n\u2022\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation premiums may increase if the agency experiences additional resolution costs.\nAny one or a combination of the factors identified above could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations and prospects. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of the virus\u2019s global economic impact, including the availability of credit, adverse impacts on our liquidity and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.\nRisks Relating to the Bank and to the Business of Banking in General\nOur business may be adversely affected by downturns in the national economy and in the economies in our market areas.\nSubstantially all of our loans are to businesses and individuals in the State of California. A decline in the economies of our local market areas of Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, and Ventura Counties in which we operate, and which we consider to be our primary market areas, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWhile real estate values and unemployment rates remain stable, a deterioration in economic conditions in the market areas we serve could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations:\n\u2022\nloan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022\nthe sale of foreclosed assets may slow;\n\u2022\ndemand for our products and services may decline possibly resulting in a decrease in our total loans or assets;\n\u2022\ncollateral for loans made could decline in value, exposing us to increased risk in our loans, reducing clients\u2019 borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans;\n\u2022\nthe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us; and\n\u2022\nthe amount of our low-cost or non-interest bearing deposits may decrease and the composition of our deposits may be adversely affected.\nA decline in local economic conditions may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of larger financial institutions whose real estate loans are geographically diverse. If we are required to liquidate a significant amount of collateral during a period of reduced real estate values, our financial condition and profitability could be adversely affected.\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, first identified in the United States during the first quarter of 2020, has had significant adverse effects on the economy in the United States, generally, and in our service area, in particular. The assistance the government supported programs under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), including the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), have lessened the disruptive effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. CWB has actively worked to assist customers in applying for and receiving assistance through the PPP, and CWB has implemented a distinct COVID-19 relief program of payment deferrals, fee waivers and suspension of residential property foreclosures. While the origination fees recognized by CWB in providing these loans have been beneficial to CWB and, in turn CWBC, the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is not known at this time and the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to negatively affect our customers and our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain. These include the scope and duration of the pandemic, the effectiveness of vaccines and other therapies in treating and preventing the disease, the financial impact of the pandemic on our employees, customers, vendors, and services area, and what further actions the Federal and state governments and other third parties may take in response to the pandemic. The clients in our service area have experienced increased unemployment, business closures, and slowdowns, especially in the retail, healthcare, hospitality, schools, and energy industries. All of this may lead to increased credit ratings downgrades, loan delinquencies, defaults, reductions in asset values, and foreclosures any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA return of recessionary conditions could result in increases in our level of non-performing loans and/or reduce demand for our products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIndex\nA return of recessionary conditions and/or negative developments in the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs, and profitability. Declines in real estate value and sales volumes and high unemployment levels may result in higher-than-expected loan delinquencies and a decline in demand for our products and services. These negative events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our capital, liquidity, and financial condition.\nFurthermore, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, in an attempt to help the overall economy, had among other things, kept interest rates low through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of U.S. Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. The Federal Reserve Board increased the federal funds rate by 25 basis points in December 2016, 75 basis points in 2017, and 100 basis points in 2018, decreased the federal funds rate by 75 basis points in 2019 and decreased the federal funds rate by 150 basis points in 2020 to help stimulate the economy. The potential for further changes in the federal funds rate exists in the near future. Market rates of interest tend to follow the federal funds rate, and decreasing rates tend to enhance borrowing and stimulate housing markets and the U.S. economic conditions.\nReserve for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses.\nThe risk of nonpayment of loans is inherent in all lending activities, and nonpayment, if it occurs, may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and/or results of operations. The Company maintains a reserve for loan losses to absorb estimated probable losses inherent in the loan and commitment portfolios as of the balance sheet date. Provisions are taken from earnings and applied to the loan loss reserves as the risk of loss in the loan and commitment portfolios increases. Conversely, credits to earnings from the loan loss reserves are made when asset qualities improve resulting in a decrease in the risk of loss in the loan and commitment portfolios. As of December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses was $10.2 million, or 1.23% of loans held for investment. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we had $3.9 million in loans on nonaccrual, $0.2 million of which are government guaranteed. In determining the level of the reserve for loan losses, management makes various assumptions and judgments about the loan portfolio. Management relies on an analysis of the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, volume and types of loans, trends in classifications, volume and trends in delinquencies and non-accruals, national and local economic conditions and other pertinent information known to Management at the time of the analysis. If Management\u2019s assumptions are incorrect, the reserve for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and/or results of operations. While the allowance for loan losses was determined to be adequate at December 31, 2020, based on the information available to us at the time, there can be no assurance that the allowance will be adequate to cover actual losses in the loan portfolio in the future.\nAll of our lending involves underwriting risks.\nLending, even when secured by the assets of a business, involves considerable risk of loss in the event of failure of the business. To reduce such risk, the Company typically takes additional security interests in other collateral of the borrower, such as real property, certificates of deposit, life insurance, and/or obtains personal guarantees. Despite efforts to reduce risk of loss, additional measures may not prove sufficient as the value of the additional collateral or personal guarantees may be significantly reduced. There can be no assurances that collateral values will be sufficient to repay loans should borrowers become unable to repay loans in accordance with their original terms and, if not, the cumulative effect may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and/or results of operations.\nThe Company is dependent on real estate concentrated in the State of California.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately $472.2 million, or 55%, of our loan portfolio is secured by various forms of real estate, including residential and commercial real estate. A decline in current economic conditions or rising interest rates could have an adverse effect on the demand for new loans, the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans and the value of real estate and other collateral securing loans. The real estate securing our loan portfolio is concentrated in California. A decline in the real estate market could materially and adversely affect the business of CWB because a significant portion of its loans are secured by real estate. The ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral would then be diminished and CWB would be more likely to suffer losses on loans. Substantially all of the real property collateral is located in California. If there is decline in real estate values, especially in California, the collateral for their loans would provide less security. Real estate values could be affected by, among other things, a decline of economic conditions, an increase in foreclosures, a decline in home sale volumes, an increase in interest rates, high levels of unemployment, drought, earthquakes, brush fires and other natural disasters particular to California.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and financial accounting or reporting, including changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, may adversely affect us.\nIndex\nThe Company is subject to extensive regulation and supervision that govern almost all aspects of its operations. Intended to protect clients, depositors, consumers, deposit insurance funds and the stability of the U.S. financial system, these laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on our business activities, limit the dividend or distributions that the Company can pay, restrict the ability of institutions to guarantee the Company's debt and impose certain specific accounting requirements that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs. We are currently facing increased regulation and supervision of our industry. Such additional regulation and supervision may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. Further, our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure was inadvertent or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines, and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, capital base and the price of our securities. Further, any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe are periodically subject to examination and scrutiny by a number of banking agencies and, depending upon the findings and determinations of these agencies, we may be required to make adjustments to our business that could adversely affect us.\nFederal banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a federal banking agency were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, asset concentration, earnings prospects, management, liquidity sensitivity to market risk or other aspects of any of our operations has become unsatisfactory, or that we or our management is in violation of any law or regulation, it could take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to change the asset composition of our portfolio or balance sheet, to assess civil monetary penalties against our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance. If we become subject to such regulatory actions, our business, results of operations and reputation may be negatively impacted.\nCWBC is subject to regulation and supervision by the FRB and CWB is subject to supervision and regulation by the OCC and the FDIC with applicable laws and regulations governing the types, amounts and terms of investments and loans we make, disclosures of products and services we offer to our clients, the levels of capital we must maintain, and the rates of interest we may pay. Those regulations continuously change and may increase our costs of doing business and reduce or limit our ability to pursue or affect our business. While legislation enacted in 2018 was designed to reduce some of the obligations imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act, no assurances can be given that such modifications will be implemented and that future changes in applicable laws and regulations like the enactment of the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 would not impose regulatory restrictions resulting in a negative impact on CWBC. For further discussion, see \u201cSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\u201d herein.\nThe short-term and long-term impact of the regulatory capital standards and the capital rules is uncertain.\nThe federal banking agencies revised capital guidelines to reflect the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and to affect the implementation of the Basel III Accords. The quantitative measures, established by the regulators to ensure capital adequacy, require that a bank holding company maintain minimum ratios of capital to risk-weighted assets. Various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act increase the capital requirements of bank holding companies, such as the Company, and non-bank financial companies that are supervised by the Federal Reserve. For a further discussion of the capital rules, see \u201cSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\u201d herein.\nCurtailment of government guaranteed loan programs could affect a segment of the Company\u2019s business.\nA segment of our business consists of originating and periodically selling government guaranteed loans, in particular those guaranteed by the USDA and the SBA. From time to time, the government agencies that guarantee these loans reach their internal limits and cease to guarantee loans. In addition, these agencies may change their rules for loans or Congress may adopt legislation that would have the effect of discontinuing or changing the loan programs. Non-governmental programs could replace government programs for some borrowers, but the terms might not be equally acceptable. Therefore, if these changes occur, the volume of loans to small business, industrial and agricultural borrowers of the types that now qualify for government guaranteed loans could decline. Also, the profitability of these loans could decline.\nSmall business customers may lack the resources to weather a downturn in the economy.\nOne of the primary focal points of our business development and marketing strategy is serving the banking and financial services needs of small to medium-sized businesses and professional organizations. Small businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than do larger entities. If economic conditions are generally unfavorable in the Company\u2019s service areas, the businesses of the Company\u2019s lending clients and their ability to repay outstanding loans may be negatively affected. As a consequence, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIndex\nCWBC and CWB have liquidity risk.\nLiquidity risk is the risk that CWBC and CWB will have insufficient cash or access to cash to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs, and for other corporate purposes. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a material adverse effect on liquidity. Access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance business activities could be impaired by factors that affect either entity specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against either entity. The ability of CWB to acquire deposits or borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to CWB, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole. CWB mitigates liquidity risk by establishing and accessing lines of credit with various financial institutions and having back-up access to the brokered Certificate of Deposits \u201cCD\u2019s\u201d markets. Results of operations could be adversely affected if either entity were unable to satisfy current or future financial obligations.\nAs a legal entity, separate and distinct from the Bank, CWBC must rely on its own resources to pay its operating expenses and dividends to its shareholders. In addition to raising capital on its own behalf or borrowing from external sources, CWBC may also obtain funds from dividends paid by, and fees charged for services provided to, the Bank. However, statutory, and regulatory constraints on the Bank may restrict or totally preclude the payment of dividends by the Bank to CWBC, thereby negatively impacting its separate liquidity.\nFrom time to time, the Company has been dependent on borrowings from the FHLB and, infrequently, the FRB, and there can be no assurance these programs will be available as needed.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company has borrowings from the FHLB of San Francisco of $105.0 million and no borrowings from the FRB. The Company in the recent past has been reliant on such borrowings to satisfy its liquidity needs. The Company\u2019s borrowing capacity is generally dependent on the value of the Company\u2019s collateral pledged to these entities. These lenders could reduce the borrowing capacity of the Company or eliminate certain types of collateral and could otherwise modify or even terminate their loan programs. Any change or termination could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity and profitability.\nThe Company is exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we obtain title.\nApproximately 55% of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio at December 31, 2020 was secured by real estate. In the course of our business, the Company may foreclose and take title to real estate and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. The Company may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation, and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if the Company is the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, it may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. These costs and claims could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and prospects.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability, business, and prospects.\nMost of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature, which subjects it to significant risks from changes in interest rates and can impact the Company\u2019s net income and the valuation of its assets and liabilities. Increases or decreases in prevailing interest rates could have an adverse affect on the Company\u2019s business, asset quality and prospects. The Company\u2019s operating income and net income depend to a great extent on its net interest margin. Net interest margin is the difference between the interest yields received on loans, securities and other earning assets and the interest rates paid on interest-bearing deposits, borrowings, and other liabilities. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, including competition, general economic conditions, and monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve. If the rate of interest paid on interest-bearing deposits, borrowings and other liabilities increases more than the rate of interest received on loans, securities and other earning assets increases, the Company\u2019s net interest income, and therefore earnings, would be adversely affected. The Company\u2019s earnings also could be adversely affected if the rates on its loans and other investments fall more quickly than those on its deposits and other liabilities.\nIn addition, loan volumes are affected by market interest rates on loans. Rising interest rates generally are associated with a lower volume of loan originations while lower interest rates are usually associated with higher loan originations. Conversely, in rising interest rate environments, loan prepayment rates will decline and in falling interest rate environments, loan prepayment rates will increase. The Company cannot guarantee that it will be able to minimize interest rate risk. In addition, an increase in the general level of interest rates may adversely affect the ability of certain borrowers to pay the interest on and principal of their debt obligations.\nIndex\nInterest rates also affect how much money the Company can lend. When interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing increases. Accordingly, changes in market interest rates could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s net interest spread, asset quality, loan origination volume, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be impacted by the transition from LIBOR as a reference rate.\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is used extensively in the United States and globally as a reference rate for various commercial and financial contracts, including adjustable-rate mortgages, corporate debt, interest rate swaps and other derivatives. In November 2020, the Federal Reserve Board issued a statement supporting the release of a proposal and supervisory statements designed to provide a clear end date for U.S. Dollar LIBOR (USD LIBOR), and the federal banking agencies issued a release encouraging banks to stop entering into USD LIBOR contracts by the end of 2021, noting that most legacy contracts will mature prior to the date LIBOR ceases to be issued. It is uncertain at this time the extent to which those entering into financial contracts will transition to any other particular benchmark. Other benchmarks may perform differently than LIBOR or other alternative benchmarks or have other consequences that cannot currently be anticipated. It is also uncertain what will happen with instruments that rely on LIBOR for future interest rate adjustments and which remain outstanding when LIBOR ceases to exist.\nThe Federal Reserve Board, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large financial institutions, is considering replacing USD LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by United States Treasury securities, otherwise known as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). SOFR is observed and backward looking, which stands in contrast with LIBOR under the current methodology, which is an estimated forward-looking rate and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given that SOFR is a secured rate backed by government securities, it will be a rate that does not consider bank credit risk (as is the case with LIBOR). SOFR is therefore likely to be lower than LIBOR and is less likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions. The extent to which SOFR attains traction as a LIBOR replacement tool is not known, although transactions using SOFR have been completed, including by Fannie Mae. Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ceased accepting adjustable-rate mortgages tied to LIBOR and began accepting mortgages based on SOFR in 2020, and many issuers are now utilizing SOFR.\nThe Company is monitoring the LIBOR transition process and has identified all LIBOR-related contracts and determined which will require amended language to incorporate a substitute reference rate. The Company continues to consider a replacement index for 2021 and beyond.\nUntil this replacement rate is identified, and all agreements have been addressed, we will continue to have a few loans and investment securities with attributes that are directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR could create additional costs or risk for us. Since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR. The transition will change our market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. Further, our failure to adequately manage this transition process with our clients could impact our reputation. Although we are currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be, any market-wide transition away from LIBOR could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s future success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in a highly competitive market.\nThe Company faces substantial competition in all phases of its operations from a variety of different competitors. Its competitors, including commercial banks, community banks, savings and loan associations, mutual savings banks, credit unions, consumer finance companies, insurance companies, securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors, money market mutual funds, online banks, Fintech companies, and other financial institutions, compete with lending and deposit-gathering services offered by the Company. Increased competition in the Company\u2019s markets may result in reduced loans and deposits.\nThere is very strong competition for financial services in the market areas in which we conduct our businesses from many local commercial banks as well as numerous national commercial banks and regionally based commercial banks. Many of these competing institutions have much greater financial and marketing resources than we have. Due to their size, many competitors can achieve larger economies of scale and may offer a broader range of products and services than us. If we are unable to offer competitive products and services, our business may be negatively affected.\nIn order to remain competitive in our industry and provide our clients with the latest products and services, we must be able to keep up with the changes in technology. Many of the financial institutions and the financial technology companies with whom we compete, have greater resources than we do to develop and implement the technology-driven products and our failure to keep pace with these changes could have an adverse effect on our client relations and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nSome of the financial services organizations with whom we compete are not subject to the same degree of regulation as is imposed on bank holding companies and federally insured depository institutions. As a result, these non-bank competitors have certain advantages over us in accessing funding and in providing various services. The banking business in our primary market areas is very competitive, and the level of competition facing us may increase further, which may limit our asset growth and financial results.\nIndex\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired, which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nThe Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. If we are unable to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting, we might be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis and might suffer adverse regulatory consequences or violate NASDAQ listing standards. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. We have in the past and may in the future discover areas of our internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that need improvement. Our internal control conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company will be detected. If we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, which could result in regulatory action and which could require us to restate our financial statements. Any such restatement could result in a loss of public confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and sanctions imposed on us by the SEC.\nChanges in accounting standards or inaccurate estimates or assumptions in the application of accounting policies could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported value of our assets or liabilities and results of operations and are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. If those assumptions, estimates, or judgments were incorrectly made, we could be required to correct and restate prior period financial statements. Accounting standard-setters and those who interpret the accounting standards (such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, banking regulators and our independent registered public accounting firm) may also amend or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how various standards should be applied. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new revised standard retroactively, resulting in the need to revise and republish prior period financial statements.\nOne change is ASU 2016-13, which was released by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in 2016 and must be adopted by the Company by no later than January 1, 2023. Currently, the impairment model used by financial institutions to assess the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses is based on incurred losses, and loans are recognized as impaired when there is no longer an assumption that future cash flows will be collected in full under the originally contracted terms. This model will be replaced by the current expected credit loss (\"CECL\") model, in which financial institutions will be required to use historical information, current conditions and reasonable forecasts to estimate the expected loss over the life of the loan. The transition to the CECL model will necessitate significantly greater data requirements and changes to methodologies to accurately account for expected losses over the life of a loan. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to increase reserves and the allowance for loan losses as a result of the implementation of CECL. Increased provisions for loan losses may adversely affect the results of operations and our financial condition.\nNatural disasters, severe weather, terrorist attacks, and threats of war or actual war may impact all aspects of our operations, revenues, costs, and stock price in unpredictable ways\nIn the last few years, California has experienced extensive wildfires that have burned millions of acres, destroyed thousands of homes and commercial properties, and resulted in the loss of life not only in California generally but also directly in our market area. Such natural disasters sometimes were followed by significant rains resulting in further loss of property. Also, in recent years, California has experienced a drought, which if prolonged could negatively affect our clients. As of December 31, 2020, CWB had $51.0 million of agricultural loans. The occurrence of severe weather conditions and the resulting disasters cannot be predicted with any certainty and a substantial portion of our clients\u2019 businesses and residences are located in areas susceptible to such events as earthquakes, floods, droughts, and wildfires. The occurrence of such events could adversely impact our clients\u2019 and their businesses and ability to repay their loans all of which could have a material adverse effect on CWBC.\nThe business may be adversely affected by internet fraud.\nThe Company is inherently exposed to many types of operational risk, including those caused by the use of computer, internet, and telecommunications systems. These risks may manifest themselves in the form of fraud by employees, by clients, other outside entities targeting us and/or our clients that use our internet banking, electronic banking, or some other form of our telecommunications systems. Given the growing level of use of electronic, internet-based, and networked systems to conduct business directly or indirectly with our clients, certain fraud losses may not be avoidable regardless of the preventative and detection systems in place, which losses could adversely affect the Company and its financial condition.\nIndex\nWe may experience interruptions or breaches in our information system security.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption, or breach in the security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our client relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan, and other systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of these information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of these information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of client business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs, and cause losses.\nAs a financial institution, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity that may be committed against us or our clients, which may result in financial losses to us or our clients, privacy breaches against our clients, or damage to our reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, and other dishonest acts. In recent periods, there has been a rise in electronic fraudulent activity within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector, due to cyber criminals targeting commercial bank accounts. Consistent with industry trends, we have also experienced an increase in attempted electronic fraudulent activity in recent periods.\nIn addition, our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks. Although we take numerous protective measures to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the Company\u2019s and our clients\u2019 information across all geographic and product lines, and endeavor to modify these protective measures as circumstances warrant, the nature of the threats continues to evolve. As a result, our computer systems, software, and networks and those of our clients may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss, or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber attacks and other events that could have an adverse security impact and result in significant losses by us and/or our clients. Despite the defensive measures we take to manage our internal technological and operational infrastructure, these threats may originate externally from third parties, such as foreign governments, organized crime and other hackers, and outsource or infrastructure-support providers and application developers, or the threats may originate from within our organization. Given the increasingly high volume of our transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they can be discovered and rectified.\nWe also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination, or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing agents, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source of an attack on, or breach of, our operational systems, data, or infrastructure. In addition, as interconnectivity with our clients grows, we increasingly face the risk of operational failure with respect to our clients\u2019 systems.\nAlthough to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, the outsourcing of some of our business operations, and the continued uncertain global economic environment. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nWe maintain an insurance policy which we believe provides sufficient coverage at a manageable expense for an institution of our size and scope with similar technological systems. However, we cannot assure that this policy will afford coverage for all possible losses or would be sufficient to cover all financial losses, damages, penalties, including lost revenues, should we experience any one or more of our or a third party\u2019s systems failing or experiencing attack.\nThe success of the Company is dependent upon its ability to recruit and retain qualified employees, especially seasoned relationship bankers.\nThe Company\u2019s business plan includes and is dependent upon hiring and retaining highly qualified and motivated executives and employees at every level. In particular, our relative success to date has been partly the result of the skills of our senior management and management\u2019s ability to identify and retain highly qualified relationship bankers that have long-standing relationships in their communities. These professionals bring with them valuable client relationships and have been integral in our ability to attract loans and deposits, and to expand our market share. From time to time, the Company recruits or utilizes the services of employees who are subject to limitations on their ability to use confidential information of a prior employer, to freely compete with that employer, or to solicit clients of that employer. If the Company is unable to hire or retain qualified employees, it may not be able to successfully execute its business strategy. If the Company or its employee is found to have violated any nonsolicitation or other restrictions applicable to it or its employees, the Company or its employee could become subject to litigation or other proceedings.\nIndex\nWe may be required to raise capital in the future, but that capital may not be available or may not be on acceptable terms when it is needed.\nWe are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate capital levels to support operations. We may need to raise additional capital in the future to achieve and maintain those adequate capital levels. Our ability to raise additional capital is dependent on capital market conditions at that time and on our financial performance and outlook. Regulatory changes, such as regulations to implement Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act, may require us to have more capital than was previously required. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, we may not be able to meet these requirements, and our ability to further expand our operations through organic growth or through acquisitions may be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit.\nOur common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in our common stock is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company.\nOur ability to pay dividends and continue with share repurchases is subject to restrictions.\nAs a holding company with no significant assets other than the Bank, CWBC is dependent on dividends from the Bank to fund operating expenses and estimated tax payments. The ability to continue to pay dividends and conduct share repurchases depends in large part upon the receipt of dividends or other capital distributions from the Bank. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends or make other capital distributions is subject to the restrictions of the National Bank Act. In addition, it is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank and other factors, that the OCC could assert that payment of dividends or other payments is an unsafe or unsound practice. The amount that the Bank may pay in dividends is further restricted due to the fact that the Bank must maintain a certain minimum amount of capital to be considered a \u201cwell capitalized\u201d institution as well as a separate capital conservation buffer, as further described under \u201cItem 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Operations - Regulatory Matters- Dividends\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nIn the event the Bank is unable to pay dividends to CWBC, it is likely that CWBC, in turn, would have to discontinue cash dividends and share repurchases and may have difficulty meeting its other financial obligations. The inability of the Bank to pay dividends to CWBC could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the market price of our common stock.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Bank paid approximately $1.2 million in dividends to CWBC. No assurances can be given that future performances will justify the payment of dividends in any particular year. Moreover, CWBC\u2019s ability to pay dividends is also subject to the restrictions of the California Corporations Code.\nIssuance of additional common stock or other equity securities in the future could dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders.\nIn order to maintain capital at desired or regulatory-required levels, or to fund future growth, the board of directors may decide from time to time to issue additional shares of common stock, or securities convertible into, exchangeable for, or representing rights to acquire shares of the common stock. The sale of these shares may significantly dilute ownership interests of shareholders. New investors in the future may also have rights, preferences and privileges senior to current shareholders, which may adversely impact current shareholders.", "PERMNO": 84215, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CWBC"}
