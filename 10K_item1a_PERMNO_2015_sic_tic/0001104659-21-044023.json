{"cik": "1614067", "company": "Aridis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as general economic and business risks and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The occurrence of any of the events or circumstances described below or other adverse events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. Additional risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business.\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should give careful consideration to the following risk factors, in addition to the other information included in this prospectus, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock. The occurrence of any of the adverse developments described in the following risk factors could materially and adversely harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe expect to continue to incur increasing net losses for the foreseeable future, and we may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. Investment in biopharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that any potential product candidate will fail to demonstrate adequate effect or an acceptable safety profile, gain regulatory approval and become commercially viable. We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales to date, and we continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. As a result, we are not profitable and have incurred losses in each period since our inception. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we reported a net loss of approximately $22.3 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $123.1 million.\nTo become and remain profitable, we or our partners must succeed in developing our product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for them, and manufacturing, marketing and selling those products for which we or our partners may obtain regulatory approval. We or they may not succeed in these activities, and we may never generate revenue from product sales that is significant enough to achieve profitability. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with biopharmaceutical product development and commercialization, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of future expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Currently, we have no products approved for commercial sale, and to date we have not generated any product revenue. We have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities, upfront payments pursuant to collaboration and license agreements, government grants and capital lease and equipment financing. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of growth or contraction of our expenses and the level and rate of growth, if any, of our revenues. Our ability to achieve profitability is dependent on our ability, alone or with others, to complete the development of our products successfully, obtain the required regulatory approvals, manufacture and market our proposed products successfully or have such products manufactured and marketed by others, and gain market acceptance for such products. There can be no assurance as to whether or when we will achieve profitability.\nOur consolidated financial statements include an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, indicating the possibility that we may not be able to operate in the future.\nPrimarily as a result of our losses incurred to date, our expected continued future losses, and limited cash balances, we have included disclosure in our consolidated financial statements expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon, among other factors, the sale of the shares of our common stock or obtaining alternate financing.\nAvailable cash resources may be insufficient to provide for our working capital needs beyond the next twelve months.\nWe expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future and will have to raise additional capital to fund our planned operations and to meet our long-term business objectives. As a result, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern unless we are able to successfully raise additional capital. Until we can generate significant cash from operations, including product and assay revenues, we expect to continue to fund our operations with the proceeds from offerings of our equity securities or debt, or transactions involving product development, technology licensing or collaboration. We can provide no assurances that any sources of a sufficient amount of financing will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. Failure to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts would significantly impact our ability to continue as a going concern. The actual amount of funds that we will need and the timing of any such investment will be determined by many factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nWe will require substantial additional capital in the future. If additional capital is not available, we will have to delay, reduce or cease operations.\nDeveloping pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is expensive. Development of our product candidates will require substantial additional funds to conduct research, development and clinical trials necessary to bring such product candidates to market and to establish manufacturing, marketing and distribution capabilities. We expect our development expenses to substantially increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance our clinical programs. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, among others:\n\u2022\nthe scope, rate of progress, results and costs of our preclinical and non-clinical studies, clinical trials and other research and development activities;\n\u2022\nthe scope, rate of progress and costs of our manufacturing development and commercial manufacturing activities;\n\u2022\nthe cost, timing and outcomes of regulatory proceedings, including FDA review of any Biologics License Application, or BLA, or New Drug Application, or NDA, that we file;\n\u2022\npayments required with respect to development milestones we achieve under our in-licensing agreements, including any such payments to University of Chicago, University of Iowa, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Inc., Brigham Young University, Public Health Service and Kenta Biotech Ltd.;\n\u2022\nthe costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with commercializing our product candidates, if they receive regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of establishing sales and marketing capabilities;\n\u2022\ncompeting technological efforts and market developments;\n\u2022\nchanges in our existing research relationships;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish collaborative arrangements to the extent necessary;\n\u2022\nrevenues received from any future products;\n\u2022\nthe ability to achieve and receive milestone payments for products licensed to collaborators; and\n\u2022\npayments received under any future strategic collaborations.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to generate significant losses for the next several years as we incur expenses to complete our clinical trial programs for our product candidates, build commercial capabilities, develop our pipeline and expand our corporate infrastructure. There is a risk of delay or failure at any stage of developing a product candidate, and the time required and costs involved in successfully accomplishing our objectives cannot be accurately predicted. Actual drug research and development costs could substantially exceed budgeted amounts, which could force us to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs. Additionally, if the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation does not continue to provide funding support, we may not be able to complete the Phase 1/2a clinical trial relating to AR-501.\nWe may never be able to generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to cover our expenses. Until we do, we expect to seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financings, collaborative relationships, license agreements, capital lease transactions or other available financing transactions. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all, and such financings could be dilutive to existing security holders. Moreover, in the event that additional funds are obtained through arrangements with collaborators, such arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies, product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves.\nIf adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs. Our failure to obtain adequate financing when needed and on acceptable terms would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Clinical Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nIf we fail to successfully complete clinical trials, fail to obtain regulatory approval or fail to successfully commercialize our product candidates, our business would be harmed and the value of our securities would decline.\nWe must be evaluated in light of the uncertainties and complexities affecting a pre-commercial biopharmaceutical company. We have not completed clinical development for any of our product candidates. Our four lead product candidates are AR-301, AR-501 and AR-101, and AR-712. We initiated a Phase 3 pivotal trial of AR-301 in VAP patients, AR-501 is in Phase 1/2a clinical testing and AR-101 is ready for Phase 2/3 pivotal testing. We are planning to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for AR-712 in the second half of 2021. We cannot be assured that our planned clinical development for our product candidates will be completed in a timely manner, or at all, or that we, or any future partner, will be able to obtain approval for our product candidates from the FDA or any foreign regulatory authority.\nRegulatory agencies, including the FDA must approve our product candidates before they can be marketed or sold. The approval process is lengthy, requires significant capital expenditures, and is uncertain as to outcome. Our ability to obtain regulatory approval of any product candidate depends on, among other things, completion of additional clinical trials, whether our clinical trials demonstrate statistically significant efficacy with safety issues that do not potentially outweigh the therapeutic benefit of the product candidates, and whether the regulatory agencies agree that the data from our future clinical trials are sufficient to support approval for any of our product candidates. The final results of our current and future clinical trials may not meet FDA or other regulatory agencies\u2019 requirements to approve a product candidate for marketing, and the regulatory agencies may otherwise determine that our manufacturing processes or facilities are insufficient to support approval. We, and our current and potential future collaborators, may need to conduct more clinical trials than we currently anticipate. Even if we do receive FDA or other regulatory agency approval, we or our collaborators may not be successful in commercializing approved product candidates. If any of these events occur, our business could be materially harmed and the value of our securities would decline.\nWe, or our collaborators, may face delays in completing our clinical trials, and may not be able to complete them at all.\nClinical trials necessary to support an application for approval to market any of our product candidates have not been completed. Our, or our collaborators\u2019, current and future clinical trials may be delayed, unsuccessful, or terminated as a result of many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching agreement on trial design and clinical study protocol with investigators and regulatory authorities in various countries where our clinical trials are being conducted;\n\u2022\ngovernmental or regulatory delays, failure to obtain regulatory approval or changes in regulatory requirements, policy or guidelines;\n\u2022\nadding new clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\nreaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022\nthe actual performance of CROs and clinical trial sites in ensuring the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndeveloping and validating companion diagnostics on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nadverse effects experienced by subjects in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing sufficient quantities of product candidates for use in clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelay or failure in achieving study efficacy endpoints and completing data analysis for a trial;\n\u2022\nregulators or institutional review boards, or IRBs, may not authorize us to commence a clinical trial;\n\u2022\nregulators or IRBs may suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or concerns about patient safety;\n\u2022\nwe may suspend or terminate our clinical trials if we believe that they expose the participating patients to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\npatients may not complete clinical trials due to safety issues, side effects, such as injection site discomfort, a belief that they are receiving placebo instead of our product candidates, or other reasons;\n\u2022\npatients with serious diseases included in our clinical trials may die or suffer other adverse medical events for reasons that may not be related to our product candidates;\n\u2022\nin those trials where our product candidate is being tested in combination with one or more other therapies, deaths may occur that may be attributable to the other therapies;\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment, preventing us from collecting the data required by our study protocol;\n\u2022\nproduct candidates may demonstrate a lack of efficacy during clinical trials;\n\u2022\npersonnel conducting clinical trials may fail to properly administer our product candidates;\n\u2022\nCOVID-19 pandemic may be protracted and cause a significant decline in patient enrollment rate; and\n\u2022\nour collaborators may decide not to pursue further clinical trials.\nOur estimate that the AR-301 Phase 3 study is a 90% power study is based on an assumed 20% effect size. If the actual effect size is less than 20%, the probability that we reach statistical significance would be reduced to a level lower than 90%, which may negatively affect the approval process for AR-301. If the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation does not continue to provide sufficient level of funding support, we may not be able to complete the Phase 1/2a clinical trial relating to AR-501.\nIn addition, we rely on academic institutions, medical institutions, physician practices and CROs to conduct, supervise or monitor some or all aspects of clinical trials involving our product candidates. We have less control over the timing and other aspects of these clinical trials than if we conducted the monitoring and supervision entirely on our own. Third parties may not perform their responsibilities for our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or consistent with a clinical trial protocol or applicable regulations. We also may rely on CROs to perform our data management and analysis. They may not provide these services as required or in a timely or compliant manner, and we may be held legally responsible for any or all of their performance failures or inadequacies.\nIf we or our collaborators experience delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed or eliminated. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow our product candidate development and approval process, and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate\nrevenues. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nOur development of a COVID-19 therapeutic candidate is at an early stage and we may not be able to successfully develop an effective therapeutic to treat COVID-19 in a timely manner, if at all.\nVarious government entities, including the U.S. government, are offering incentives, grants, and contracts to encourage additional investment by commercial organizations into preventative and therapeutic agents against COVID-19, and this may have the effect of increasing the number of competitors and/or providing advantages to known competitors. We are aware of a substantial number of companies, individuals and institutions working to develop a treatment for COVID-19, many of which have substantially greater financial, scientific, and other resources than us, and another party may be successful in producing an effective treatment against COVID-19 before we do. The rapid expansion of development programs directed at COVID-19 may also generate a scarcity of manufacturing capacity among contract research organizations that provide cGMP materials for development and commercialization of biopharmaceutical products.\nWe are committing financial resources to the development of a monoclonal antibody treatment for COVID-19, which may cause delays in or otherwise negatively impact our other development programs. In addition, our management and scientific teams have dedicated substantial efforts to our COVID-19 therapeutic development. As of the date of this report, we have 33 employees, which may make us more reliant on our individual employees and on outside contractors than companies with a greater number of employees. If we fail to attract and retain management and scientific personnel, we may be unable to successfully produce, develop and commercialize our therapeutic candidates.\nIn addition, any success in preclinical testing we might observe for our COVID-19 therapeutic candidate may not be predictive of the results of later-stage human clinical trials. Factors such as safety, efficacy and adverse events can emerge at any time in clinical testing and have the potential to have adverse consequences for our ability to proceed with clinical trials. Other factors such as the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 mutant virus variants rendering a reduction or complete loss of binding or neutralization by the mAbs, manufacturing challenges, availability of raw materials, and slow-downs in the global supply chain may delay or prevent us from receiving regulatory approval of our therapeutic candidate or, if we do receive regulatory approval, prevent a successful product launch. We may not be successful in developing a therapeutics, or another party may be successful in producing a more efficacious vaccine or other treatment for COVID-19.\nIf we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials, our clinical trials could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nClinical trials for our product candidates require us to identify and enroll a large number of patients with the disease under investigation. We may not be able to enroll a sufficient number of patients with required or desired characteristics to conduct our clinical trials in a timely manner, if at all. Patient enrollment is affected by factors including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nseverity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022\ndesign of the trial protocol;\n\u2022\nthe size and nature of the patient population;\n\u2022\neligibility criteria for the study in question;\n\u2022\nlack of a sufficient number of patients who meet the enrollment criteria for our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelays in characterizing a patient\u2019s infection to allow us to select a product candidate, which may lead patients to seek to enroll in other clinical trials or seek alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nperceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u2022\navailability of competing therapies and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nefforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nclinical trial sites being overtaxed by treating COVID-19 patients;\n\u2022\nscheduling conflicts with participating clinicians;\n\u2022\npatient referral practices of physicians;\n\u2022\nthe ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and\n\u2022\nproximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact on clinical trial enrollment worldwide. We have experienced slower enrollment of patients in our clinical trials due to the pace in which clinical sites were being initiated for enrollment and may experience similar difficulties in the future. In addition, AR-301 and AR-101 have been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus in the EU, respectively, and the low prevalence of such diseases relative to the total population may make it harder to identify patients to enroll. If we have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number or diversity of patients to conduct our clinical trials as planned, we may need to delay or terminate ongoing or planned clinical trials, either of which would have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur product candidates are based on a novel technology, which may raise development issues we may not be able to resolve, regulatory issues that could delay or prevent approval, or personnel issues that may keep us from being able to develop our product candidates.\nOur product candidates are based on our mAb technology and gallium-based anti-infective platforms. There can be no assurance that development problems related to our novel technologies will not arise in the future that will cause significant delays or that we will not able to resolve.\nRegulatory approval of novel product candidates such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than for other, more well-known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical product candidates due to our and regulatory agencies\u2019 lack of experience with them. We believe three mAbs have been approved by the FDA to date, and two other mAbs have received Emergency Use Authorization (for COVID-19 treatment). The approved mAbs are Synagis\u00ae which stimulates the immune system to target a viral infection, Anthim\u00ae which treats inhalational anthrax in combination with appropriate antibiotics, and ZINPLAVA\u00ae to reduce recurrence of Clostridium difficile infections. The novelty of our platform may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to conduct additional studies or clinical trials, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of our product candidates or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. For example, the FDA could require additional studies that may be difficult or impossible to perform.\nThe novel nature of our product candidates also means that fewer people are trained in or experienced with product candidates of this type, which may make it difficult to find, hire and retain capable personnel, particularly for research, development, commercialization and manufacturing positions. For example, study personnel may administer the wrong version of our product candidates or assign study therapy to the wrong treatment group, resulting in potential disqualification of subjects from data analysis. These factors could potentially cause a trial to fail for a reason unrelated to the efficacy of our product candidates. If we are unable to hire and retain the necessary personnel, the rate and success at which we can develop and commercialize product candidates will be limited. Any such events would increase our costs and could delay or prevent our ability to commercialize our product candidates, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop companion diagnostics for our therapeutic product candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, we may not realize the full commercial potential of our product candidates.\nWe intend to use rapid diagnostic tests of patients\u2019 respiratory samples to target our mAb product candidates to those patients we believe are infected with the bacterial agents which our mAb will act against. However, currently there is no commercially available companion diagnostic for AR-101 and AR-401. Therefore, there is a risk that a companion diagnostic for these products are not developed or\navailable to support product launch. The FDA and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States regulate companion diagnostics. Companion diagnostics require separate or coordinated regulatory approval prior to commercialization of the therapeutic product. Changes to applicable regulations could delay our development programs or delay or prevent eventual marketing approval for our product candidates that may have otherwise been approved.\nThe FDA\u2019s evolving position on the topic of companion diagnostics could affect our clinical development programs that utilize companion diagnostics. In particular, the FDA may limit our ability to use retrospective data, otherwise disagree with our approaches to trial design, biomarker qualification, clinical and analytical validity, and clinical utility, or make us repeat aspects of a trial or initiate new trials.\nAssays that can be used as companion diagnostics are commercially available, but in some cases such as for AR-101, they do not yet have regulatory approval for use as companion diagnostic. We have limited experience in the development of diagnostics and may not be successful in developing necessary diagnostics to pair with those product candidates that require a companion diagnostic.\nGiven our limited experience in developing diagnostics, we expect to rely in part on third parties for their design and manufacture. If we, or any third parties that we engage to assist us, are unable to successfully develop companion diagnostics for our product candidates that require such diagnostics, or experience delays in doing so, the development of our product candidates may be adversely affected, our product candidates may not receive marketing approval and we may not realize the full commercial potential of any products that receive marketing approval. As a result, our business could be materially harmed.\nClinical development is a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and clinical trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the design or results of later-stage clinical trials. The results regarding initial tolerability and clinical activity generated to date in clinical trials for our AR-301 and AR-101 product candidates in HAP and VAP patients do not ensure that later clinical trials will demonstrate similar results. While we have observed in exploratory analysis statistically significant improvements in the outcomes of some of our clinical trials, many of the improvements we have seen have not reached statistical significance. Statistical significance is a statistical term that means that an effect is unlikely to have occurred by chance. In order to be approved by the FDA, European Medicines Agency, or other drug approving authorities, product candidates must demonstrate that their effect on patients\u2019 diseases in the trial is statistically significant and clinically meaningful. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. Early clinical trials frequently enroll patient populations that are different from the patient populations in later trials, resulting in different outcomes in later clinical trials from those in earlier stage clinical trials. In addition, adverse events may not occur in early clinical trials and only emerge in larger, late-stage clinical trials or after commercialization. Companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier clinical trials. If later stage clinical trials do not demonstrate efficacy and safety of our product candidates, we will not be able to market them and our business will be materially harmed.\nWe may seek a breakthrough therapy designation for our existing and future product candidates, but we might not receive such designation, and even if we do, such designation may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.\nWe may seek a breakthrough therapy designation for our existing and future product candidates; however, we cannot assure you our product candidates will meet the criteria for that designation. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a therapy that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other therapies, to treat a serious condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the therapy may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For therapies and biologics that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and\nthe sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. Therapies designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA may also be eligible for priority review if supported by clinical data at the time the new drug application is submitted to the FDA.\nDesignation as a breakthrough therapy is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe that one of our product candidates meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. Even if we receive breakthrough therapy designation, the receipt of such designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development or regulatory review or approval process compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more of our product candidates qualify as breakthrough therapies, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.\nDesignation of our product candidates as qualified infectious disease products is not assured and, in any event, even if granted, may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review, and would not assure FDA approval of our product candidates.\nWe may seek designation of our existing and future product candidates as QIDP. A QIDP is an antibacterial or antifungal drug intended to treat serious or life- threatening infections, including those caused by an antibacterial or antifungal resistant pathogen, including novel or emerging infectious pathogens or certain \u201cqualifying pathogens.\u201d A product designated as a QIDP for a particular indication will also be granted priority review by the FDA and can qualify for fast track status. Upon the approval of an NDA for a drug product designated by the FDA as a QIDP, the product is granted a period of five years of regulatory exclusivity that is in addition to any other period of regulatory exclusivity for which the product is eligible. The FDA has broad discretion whether or not to grant these designations, so even if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for such designation or status, the FDA could decide not to grant it. Moreover, even if we do receive such a designation, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures and there is no assurance that our product candidate, even if determined to be a QIDP, will be approved by the FDA.\nRegulatory authorities may not approve our product candidates even if they meet safety and efficacy endpoints in clinical trials.\nThe time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. We have discussions with and obtain guidance from regulatory authorities regarding certain aspects of our clinical development activities. These discussions are not binding commitments on the part of regulatory authorities. Under certain circumstances, regulatory authorities may revise or retract previous guidance during the course of our clinical activities or after the completion of our clinical trials. A regulatory authority may also disqualify a clinical trial in whole or in part from consideration in support of approval of a potential product for commercial sale or otherwise deny approval of that product. Prior to regulatory approval, a regulatory authority may elect to obtain advice from outside experts regarding scientific issues and/or marketing applications under a regulatory authority review. In the United States, these outside experts are convened through the FDA\u2019s Advisory Committee process, which would report to the FDA and make recommendations that may differ from the views of the FDA. Should an Advisory Committee be convened, it would be expected to lengthen the time for obtaining regulatory approval, if such approval is obtained at all.\nThe FDA and foreign regulatory agencies may delay, limit or deny marketing approval for many reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\na product candidate may not be considered safe or effective;\n\u2022\nour manufacturing processes or facilities may not meet the applicable requirements;\n\u2022\nchanges in the agencies\u2019 approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional work on our part, for example, the FDA may require us to change or expand the endpoints in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndifferent divisions of the FDA are reviewing different product candidates and those divisions may have different requirements for approval; and\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory law, FDA or foreign regulatory agency organization, or personnel may result in different requirements for approval than anticipated.\nOur product candidates may not be approved even if they achieve their endpoints in clinical trials. Regulatory agencies, including the FDA, or their advisors may disagree with our trial design and our interpretations of data from preclinical studies and clinical trials. Regulatory agencies also may approve a product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than requested or may grant approval subject to the performance of post-marketing studies. In addition, regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates. We have not obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate, and it is possible that none of our existing product candidates or any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval.\nAny delay in or failure to receive or maintain approval for any of our product candidates could prevent us from ever generating revenues or achieving profitability.\nWe may be required to suspend, repeat or terminate our clinical trials if they are not conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, the results are negative or inconclusive, or the trials are not well designed.\nClinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations governing clinical studies, or other applicable foreign government guidelines, and are subject to oversight by the FDA, other foreign governmental agencies and IRBs/Ethic Committees at the medical institutions where the clinical trials are conducted. In addition, clinical trials must be conducted with product candidates produced under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and may require large numbers of test subjects. Clinical trials may be suspended by the FDA, other foreign governmental agencies or us for various reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ndeficiencies in the conduct of the clinical trials, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or clinical protocols;\n\u2022\ndeficiencies in the clinical trial operations or trial sites;\n\u2022\nthe product candidate may have unforeseen adverse side effects;\n\u2022\nthe time required to determine whether the product candidate is effective may be longer than expected;\n\u2022\ndeaths or other adverse events arising during a clinical trial due to medical problems that may not be related to clinical trial treatments;\n\u2022\nthe product candidate may not appear to be more effective than current therapies;\n\u2022\nthe quality or stability of the product candidate may fall below acceptable standards; and\n\u2022\ninsufficient quantities of the product candidate might be available to complete the trials.\nIn addition, changes in regulatory requirements and guidance may occur and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to IRBs for reexamination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial. Due to these and other factors, our product candidates could take longer to gain regulatory approval than we expect or we may never gain approval for any product candidates, which could reduce or eliminate our revenue by delaying or terminating the commercialization of our product candidates.\nA Fast Track product designation or other designation to facilitate product candidate development may not lead to faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and it does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval.\nWe have received a Fast Track product designation for AR-301 and AR-101 and we may seek Fast Track designation for other of our current or future product candidates. Receipt of a designation to facilitate product candidate development is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe one of our product candidates meets the criteria for a designation, the FDA may disagree. In any event, the receipt of such a designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review, or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate marketing approval by the FDA. In addition, the FDA may later decide that the products no longer meet the designation conditions.\nWe may not be able to maintain orphan drug marketing exclusivity for our AR-101 and AR-301 product candidates in the United States and/or the European Union, and orphan drug marketing exclusivity may not be available for any of our other product candidates.\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition (with a population of less than 200,000), which is defined as one occurring in a patient population of fewer than 200,000 in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the U.S. where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug or biologic will be recovered from sales in the United States. In the EU, following the opinion of the EMA\u2019s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, the European Commission grants orphan drug designation to a product if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the incentives derived from orphan medicinal product status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.\nGenerally, if a drug with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the drug is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA or the European Commission and the competent authorities in the EU Member States from approving another marketing application for the same drug (or similar medicinal product in the European Union) for that time period, except in limited circumstances. The applicable period is seven years in the U.S. and 10 years in the EU. The EU exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation or if the drug is sufficiently profitable that market exclusivity is no longer justified. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.\nWe have been granted orphan drug designation for our AR-101 and AR-301 drug candidates in the European Union, as well as orphan drug designation for our AR-101 drug candidate in the U.S. Although we may apply for orphan drug designation for other product candidates, we may develop in both the U.S. and EU, applicable regulatory authorities may not grant us this designation. In addition, even if such status is obtained for any other product candidate that we may develop, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the candidate from competition because other drugs, such as those with different active ingredients or molecular structures, can be approved for the same condition. Furthermore, even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve another drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior, in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. In the EU, a marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product during the 10-year period of market exclusivity for the same therapeutic indication at any time if:\n\u2022\nthe second applicant can establish in its application that its product, although similar to the orphan medicinal product already authorized, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;\n\u2022\nthe holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or\n\u2022\nthe holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.\nAny inability to secure orphan drug designation or to maintain the exclusivity benefits of this designation could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates, depending on the extent to which we would be protected by other patents and regulatory exclusivities, and may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny product candidate for which we, or our collaborators, obtain marketing approval could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market, and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, when and if any of them are approved.\nAny product candidate that we, or our collaborators, obtain marketing approval for, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continuing requirements of the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information, reports, facility registration and product listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to conditions of approval or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding off-label use. If we market our products outside of their approved indications, we will be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown problems with these products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on product distribution or use;\n\u2022\nrequirements to conduct post-marketing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwarning or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u2022\nrecall of products, fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u2022\nrefusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure; and\n\u2022\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. If we, or our collaborators, are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we, or our collaborators, are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, any marketing approval that was obtained could be lost, which would adversely affect our business, prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability.\nIf we, or our collaborators, are unable to comply with foreign regulatory requirements or obtain foreign regulatory approvals, our ability to develop foreign markets for our products could be impaired.\nSales of our products outside the U.S. will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing clinical trials, marketing approval, manufacturing, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement. These regulatory requirements vary greatly from country to country. As a result, the time required to obtain approvals outside the U.S. may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval and we may not be able to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities could require additional testing. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements or obtain required approvals could impair our ability to develop foreign markets for our products.\nWe are subject to U.S. and certain foreign export and import controls, sanctions, embargoes, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Compliance with these legal standards could impair our ability to compete in domestic and international markets. We can face criminal liability and other serious consequences for violations, which can harm our business.\nWe are subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations, various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and other state and national anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, contractors, and other collaborators from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or anything else of value to recipients in the public or private sector. We may engage third parties for clinical trials outside of the United States, to sell our products abroad once we enter a commercialization phase, and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations, and other regulatory approvals. We have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities, and other organizations. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees, agents, contractors, and other collaborators, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. Any violations of the laws and regulations described above may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export or import privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences.\nDeveloping product candidates in combination with other therapies may lead to unforeseen side effects or failures in our clinical trials.\nWe, and our collaborators, are studying our product candidates in clinical trials in combination with approved therapies, including antibiotics, and we anticipate that if any product candidates are approved for marketing, they will be approved to be used only in combination with other therapies. Our development programs and planned studies carry all the risks inherent in drug development activities, including the risk that they will fail to demonstrate meaningful efficacy or acceptable safety. In addition, our development programs are subject to additional regulatory, commercial, manufacturing and other risks because of the use of other therapies in combination with our product candidates. For example, the other therapies may lead to toxicities that are improperly attributed to our product candidates or the combination of our product candidates with other therapies may result in toxicities that the product candidate or other therapy does not produce when used alone. The other therapies we are using in combination with our product candidates may be removed from the market or become prohibitively expensive and thus be unavailable for testing or commercial use with any of our approved products. Testing product candidates in combination with other therapies may increase the risk of significant adverse effects or test failures. The timing, outcome and cost of developing products to be used in combination with other therapies is difficult to predict and dependent on a number of factors that are outside our reasonable control. If any safety or toxicity issues arise in these clinical trials or with any approved products, or if the other therapies are removed from the market, the products may not be approved, which could prevent us from ever generating revenues or achieving profitability.\nWe will need to develop or acquire additional manufacturing and distribution capabilities, or outsource the same to third parties, in order to commercialize any product candidates that obtain marketing approval, and we may encounter unexpected costs or difficulties in doing so.\nIf we independently develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates, we will need to invest in acquiring or building additional capabilities and effectively manage our operations and facilities to successfully pursue and complete future research, development and commercialization efforts. We will require additional investment and validation process development in order to qualify our commercial-scale manufacturing process to manufacture clinical trial materials and commercial material if any of our products are approved for marketing. This investment and validation process development may be expensive and time-consuming. We will require additional personnel with experience in commercial-scale manufacturing, managing of large-scale information technology systems and managing a large-scale distribution system. We will need to add personnel and expand our capabilities, which may strain our existing managerial, operational, regulatory compliance, financial and other resources. To do this effectively, we must:\n\u2022\nrecruit, hire, train, manage and motivate a growing employee base;\n\u2022\naccurately forecast demand for our products;\n\u2022\nassemble and manage the supply chain to ensure our ability to meet demand; and\n\u2022\nexpand existing operational, manufacturing, financial and management information systems.\nWe may seek FDA approval for our production process and facilities simultaneously with seeking approval for sale of our product candidates. Should we not complete the development of adequate manufacturing and distribution capabilities, including manufacturing capacity, or fail to receive timely approval of our manufacturing process and facilities, our ability to supply clinical trial materials for planned clinical trials or supply products following regulatory approval for sale could be delayed, which would further delay our clinical trials or the period of time when we would be able to generate revenues from the sale of such products, if we are even able to obtain approval or generate revenues at all.\nAdditionally, we may decide to outsource some or all of our manufacturing activities to a third-party commercial manufacturing organization, or CMO. Under any agreement with a CMO, we would have less control over the timing and quality of manufacturing than if we were to perform such manufacturing ourselves. A CMO would be manufacturing other pharmaceutical products in the same facilities as our product candidates, increasing the risk of cross product contamination. Further, there is no guarantee that any CMO will continue ongoing operations, causing potential delays in product supply, reduced revenues and other liabilities for us.\nAny such events would increase our costs and could delay or prevent our ability to commercialize our product candidates, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us, our collaborators, or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label, the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities, or litigation by injured patients, if any. To date, patients treated with AR-301 and AR-101 have experienced AEs related to the study drug, some of which have been serious. Regarding AR-301, few (2.8%) adverse events, or AEs, were deemed related, and no serious adverse events, or SAEs, were deemed to be related to AR-301 treatment. There were six deaths in the trial, none of which were deemed related to AR-301. Regarding AR-101, 12 SAEs were experienced by five subjects. An event of cardiorespiratory arrest was judged as probably related to AR-101 and events of hyperbilirubinemia and cholestasis, although pre-existent, were deemed possibly related. In both cases, the causality assessment by the investigators accounted for the fact that a contribution by AR-101 to the AE could not be excluded with certainty although other probable causes were acknowledged. The other SAEs were deemed unrelated. The AR-712 mAbs may exhibit a reduction or complete loss of efficacy due to the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 mutant virus variants.\nBecause our product candidates are intended to assist the immune system, our clinical trials could reveal an unacceptable severity and prevalence of side effects, including, but not limited to, adverse immune responses that lead to previously unobserved complications. As a result of any side effects, our clinical trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development, or deny approval, of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. The drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nAdditionally, if one or more of our product candidates receives marketing approval, and we, our collaborators, or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u2022\nwe may be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nIn addition, we cannot assure you that the bacteria which our mAbs target will not in the future develop a resistance to our mAbs.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nIf we cannot conduct the non-clinical testing required by regulatory authorities to demonstrate an acceptable toxicity profile for our product candidates in non-clinical studies, we will not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials or obtain approval for our product candidates.\nIn order to move a product candidate into human clinical trials, we must first demonstrate an acceptable toxicity profile in preclinical testing. Furthermore, in order to obtain approval, we must also demonstrate safety in various non-clinical tests. We may not have conducted or may not conduct the types of non-clinical testing required by regulatory authorities, or future non-clinical tests may indicate that our product candidates are not safe for use. Preclinical and non-clinical testing is expensive, time-consuming and has an uncertain outcome. In addition, success in initial non-clinical testing does not ensure that later non-clinical testing will be successful. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the non-clinical testing process, which could delay or prevent our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nour preclinical and non-clinical testing may produce inconclusive or negative safety results, which may require us to conduct additional non-clinical testing or to abandon product candidates;\n\u2022\nour product candidates may have unfavorable pharmacology or toxicity characteristics;\n\u2022\nour product candidates may cause undesirable side effects such as negative immune responses that lead to complications;\n\u2022\nour enrolled patients may have allergies that lead to complications after treatment; and\n\u2022\nthe FDA or other regulatory authorities may determine that additional safety testing is required.\nAny such events would increase our costs and could delay or prevent our ability to commercialize our product candidates, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we have multiple product candidates in our clinical pipeline and are considering a variety of target indications, we may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we must focus our research and development efforts on those product candidates and specific indications that we believe are the most promising. As a\nresult, we may forego or delay our pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. We may in the future spend our resources on other research programs and product candidates for specific indications that ultimately do not yield any commercially viable products. Furthermore, if we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates, we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates if and when they are approved.\nWe do not have a sales and marketing infrastructure or any experience in the sales, marketing or distribution of pharmaceutical products. We may seek additional third-party collaborators for the commercialization of our other product candidates. In the future, we may choose to build a focused sales and marketing infrastructure to market or co-promote some of our product candidates if and when they are approved, which would be expensive and time-consuming. Alternatively, we may elect to outsource these functions to third parties. Either approach carries significant risks. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time-consuming and, if done improperly, could delay a product launch and result in limited sales. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel. Outsourcing sales and marketing capabilities will depend on our ability to enter into and maintain agreements with other companies having sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, the ability of such companies to successfully market and sell our product candidates, and our ability to enter into such agreements on terms favorable to us.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products on our own include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nour inability to recruit, manage and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022\nthe inability of marketing personnel to develop effective marketing materials;\n\u2022\nthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future products;\n\u2022\nthe lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u2022\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nEntry into agreements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates will subject us to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nwe may be required to relinquish important rights to our products or product candidates;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our distributors or collaborators may devote to the commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u2022\ndistributors or collaborators may experience financial difficulties;\n\u2022\nour distributors or collaborators may not devote sufficient time to the marketing and sales of our products; and\n\u2022\nbusiness combinations or significant changes in a collaborator\u2019s business strategy may adversely affect a collaborator\u2019s willingness or ability to complete its obligations under any arrangement.\nThe availability and amount of reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved, and the manner in which government and private payors may reimburse for any potential products, are uncertain.\nObtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost effectiveness data for the use of our products to the payor. There may be significant delays in obtaining such coverage and reimbursement for newly approved products, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside of the United States. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a product will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, intellectual property, manufacture, sale and distribution expenses. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost products and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of product from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare coverage and reimbursement determinations. It is difficult to predict at this time what third-party payors will decide with respect to the coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.\nReimbursement may impact the demand for, and/or the price of, any product for which we obtain marketing approval. Assuming we obtain coverage for a given product by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with those medications. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the cost of our products. Therefore, coverage and adequate reimbursement is critical to new product acceptance. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available.\nThe U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governmental entities have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and coverage and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of government controls and measures and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could exclude or limit our products from coverage and limit payments for pharmaceuticals.\nIn addition, we expect that the increased emphasis on managed care and cost containment measures in the U.S. by third-party payors and government authorities to continue and will place pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and coverage. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more drug products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.\nFailure to attract and retain key personnel could impede our ability to develop our products and to obtain new collaborations or other sources of funding.\nBecause of the specialized scientific nature of our business and the novel properties of our antibody platform, our success is highly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and technical personnel, consultants and advisors. We depend greatly on our founders Dr. Vu Truong, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Scientific Officer and a Director, and Dr. Eric Patzer, our Executive Chairman.\nWe will also need to recruit a significant number of additional personnel in order to achieve our operating goals and financial reporting obligations. In order to pursue our product development and marketing and sales plans, we will need to hire additional qualified scientific personnel to perform research and development, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical testing, government regulation, manufacturing, marketing and sales, which may strain our existing managerial, operational, regulatory compliance, financial and other resources. We also rely on consultants and advisors to assist in formulating our research and development strategy and adhering to complex regulatory requirements. We face competition for qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities and other research institutions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such individuals on acceptable terms, if at all. The failure to attract and retain qualified personnel, consultants and advisors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on research programs and product candidates for the indications that we believe are the most scientifically and commercially promising. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable scientific or commercial products or profitable market opportunities. In addition, we may spend valuable time and managerial and financial resources on research programs and product candidates for specific indications that ultimately do not yield any scientifically or commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the scientific and commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in situations where it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole rights to development and commercialization.\nRisks Relating to Manufacturing Activities\nWe have no experience manufacturing our product candidates at commercial scale, and there can be no assurance that our product candidates can be manufactured in compliance with regulations at a cost or in quantities necessary to make them commercially viable. There can be no assurance that any contract manufacturing facilities will be acceptable for licensure by regulatory authorities or that we can contract to build acceptable facilities.\nWe have no experience in commercial-scale manufacturing of mAbs. We may develop our manufacturing capacity in part by building manufacturing facilities. This activity would require substantial additional funds and we would need to hire and train significant numbers of qualified employees to staff these facilities. We may not be able to develop commercial-scale manufacturing facilities that are adequate to produce materials for additional later-stage clinical trials or commercial use. We currently rely on CMOs for bulk product manufacturing and sterile fill and finish of our products, and these contractors currently manufacture our product candidates at a scale that is not adequate for commercial supply. Failure to find and maintain satisfactory commercial-scale manufacturing contractors could impair our ability to supply product for clinical and commercial needs. Additionally, we may decide to outsource some or all of our bulk product manufacturing activities to a third-party CMO. Failure of any of these contractors to maintain compliance with cGMPs and other regulatory and legal requirements could result in government actions that would limit or eliminate clinical trial and commercial product supply. Under any agreement with a CMO, we would have less control over the timing and quality of manufacturing than if we were performing such manufacturing ourselves. A CMO would be manufacturing other pharmaceutical products in the same facilities as our product candidates, increasing the risk of cross product contamination. Further, there is no guarantee that any CMO will continue ongoing operations, causing potential delays in product supply, reduced revenues and other liabilities for us.\nThe equipment and facilities employed in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals are subject to stringent qualification requirements by regulatory agencies, including validation of equipment, systems and processes. We may be subject to lengthy delays and expense in conducting validation studies, if we can meet the requirements at all.\nIf we are unable to manufacture or contract for a sufficient supply of our product candidates on acceptable terms, or if we encounter delays or difficulties in our manufacturing processes or our relationships with other manufacturers, our preclinical and clinical testing schedule would be delayed. This in turn would delay the submission of product candidates for regulatory approval and thereby delay the market introduction and subsequent sales of any products that receive regulatory approval, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we or our contract manufacturers must supply all necessary documentation in support of our regulatory approval applications on a timely basis and must adhere to cGMP regulations enforced by the FDA and other regulatory bodies through their facilities inspection programs. If these facilities cannot pass a pre-approval plant inspection, the approval by the FDA or other regulatory bodies of the products will not be granted. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve our facilities and processes for the manufacture of our product candidates or if they withdraw any such approval in the future, we may need to correct the issues or find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved.\nOur contract manufacturers are subject to significant regulation with respect to manufacturing of our products.\nAll entities involved in the preparation of a product candidate for clinical trials or commercial sale, including our contract manufacturing organizations used for bulk product manufacturing and filling and finishing of our bulk product, are subject to extensive regulation. Components of a finished product approved for commercial sale or used in late-stage clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP. These regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures, including record keeping, and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of investigational products and products approved for sale. The facilities and quality systems of some or all of our third-party contractors must pass a pre-approval inspection for compliance with the applicable regulations as a condition of any regulatory approval of our product candidates. In addition, the regulatory authorities may, at any time, audit or inspect a manufacturing facility involved with the preparation of our product candidates or the associated quality systems for compliance with the regulations applicable to the activities being conducted. The regulatory authorities also may, at any time following approval of a product for sale, audit the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contractors or raw material suppliers. If any such inspection or audit identifies a failure to comply with applicable regulations or if a violation of our product specifications or applicable regulations occurs independent of such an inspection or audit, the relevant regulatory authority may require remedial measures that may be costly and time-consuming to implement and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical trial or commercial sales or the temporary or permanent closure of a facility. Our third-party contractors or raw material suppliers may refuse to implement remedial measures required by regulatory authorities. Any failure to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations or failure to implement required remedial measures imposed upon third parties with whom we contract could materially harm our business.\nWe rely on relationships with third-party contract manufacturers and raw material suppliers, which limits our ability to control the availability of, and manufacturing costs for, our product candidates.\nProblems with any of our contract manufacturers\u2019 or raw material suppliers\u2019 facilities or processes, could prevent or delay the production of adequate supplies of finished products. This could delay clinical trials or delay and reduce commercial sales and materially harm our business. Any prolonged delay or interruption in the operations of our collaborators\u2019 facilities or contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities could result in cancellation of shipments, loss of components in the process of being manufactured or a shortfall in availability of a product candidate or products. A number of factors could cause interruptions, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe inability of a supplier to provide raw materials;\n\u2022\nequipment malfunctions or failures at the facilities of our collaborators or suppliers;\n\u2022\nemployee absenteeism as a result of coronavirus outbreaks;\n\u2022\nhigh process failure rates;\n\u2022\ndamage to facilities due to natural or man-made disasters;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory requirements or standards that require modifications to our or our collaborators\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\naction by regulatory authorities or by us that results in the halting or slowdown of production of components or finished product at our facilities or the facilities of our collaborators or suppliers;\n\u2022\nproblems that delay or prevent manufacturing technology transfer to another facility, contract manufacturer or collaborator with subsequent delay or inability to start up a commercial facility;\n\u2022\na contract manufacturer or supplier going out of business, undergoing a capacity shortfall or otherwise failing to produce product as contractually required;\n\u2022\nemployee or contractor misconduct or negligence; and\n\u2022\nshipping delays, losses or interruptions; and other similar factors.\nBecause manufacturing processes are complex and are subject to a lengthy regulatory approval process, alternative qualified production capacity and sufficiently trained or qualified personnel may not be available on a timely or cost-effective basis or at all. Difficulties or delays in our contract manufacturers\u2019 production of drug substances could delay our clinical trials, increase our costs, damage our reputation, and cause us to lose revenue and market share if we are unable to timely meet market demand for any products that are approved for sale.\nThe manufacturing process for our product candidates has several components that are sourced from a single manufacturer. If we utilize an alternative manufacturer or alternative component, we may be required to demonstrate comparability of the drug product before releasing the product for clinical use and we may not be to find an alternative supplier. For example, the stoppers used to seal the vials of our products are made by a single supplier using a proprietary formula and process. Any change to the stopper would require us to carry out lengthy studies to verify that our product remains stable with the replacement stopper. The loss of any of our current suppliers could result in manufacturing delays for the component substitution, and we may need to accept changes in terms or price from our existing supplier in order to avoid such delays.\nFurther, if our contract manufacturers are not in compliance with regulatory requirements at any stage, including post-marketing approval, we may be fined, forced to remove a product from the market and/or experience other adverse consequences, including delays, which could materially harm our business.\nA pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, such as COVID-19, may materially and adversely affect our business and operations.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has since spread to multiple countries, including the United States and several European countries. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the United States and global economies and may affect our operations and those of third parties on which we rely, including by causing disruptions in the supply of our product candidates and the conduct of current and future clinical trials. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may affect the operations of the FDA and other health authorities, which could result in delays of reviews and approvals, including with respect to our product candidates. The evolving COVID-19 pandemic is also likely to directly or indirectly impact the pace of enrollment in our Phase 3 pivotal trial for AR-301 and our Phase 1 clinical trial for AR-501 for at least the next several months and possibly longer as patients may avoid or may not be able to travel to healthcare facilities and physicians\u2019 offices unless due to a health emergency. Such facilities and offices may also be required to focus limited resources on non-clinical trial matters, including treatment of COVID-19 patients, and may not be available, in whole or in part, for clinical trial services related to AR-301 and AR-501 or our other product candidates. Additionally, while the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic is difficult to assess or predict, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global financial markets may reduce our ability to access capital, which could negatively impact our short-term and long-term liquidity. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, financing or clinical trial activities or on healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material impact on our liquidity, capital resources, operations and business and those of the third parties on which we rely.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations, and those of our third-party manufacturers, CROs and other contractors and consultants, could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or man-made disasters or business interruptions, for which we are predominantly self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Los Gatos, California, an area prone to wildfires and earthquakes. These and other natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. If a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. Any disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place may prove inadequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAny disruption in production or inability to produce or ship adequate quantities to meet our needs, whether as a result of a natural disaster or other causes (such as the recent outbreak of the coronavirus), could impair our ability to operate our business on a day-to-day basis and to continue our research and development of our product candidates. In addition, we are exposed to the possibility of product supply disruption and increased costs in the event of changes in the policies of the United States government, political unrest or unstable economic conditions. Any recall of the manufacturing lots or similar action regarding our API used in clinical trials could delay the trials or detract from the integrity of the trial data and its potential use in future regulatory filings. In addition, manufacturing interruptions or failure to comply with regulatory requirements by any of these manufacturers could significantly delay clinical development of potential products and reduce third-party or clinical researcher interest and support of proposed trials. These interruptions or failures could also impede commercialization of our product candidate and impair our competitive position.\nWe use and generate hazardous materials in our business and must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive.\nOur research, development and manufacturing involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, various active microorganisms and volatile organic compounds, and we may incur significant costs as a result of the need to comply with numerous laws and regulations. For example, as a pharmacologically-active material, any residual impurities in process-waste streams must be disposed of as hazardous waste. We are subject to laws and regulations enforced by the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Agency, foreign health authorities and other regulatory requirements, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and other current and potential federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of our products, materials used to develop and manufacture our product candidates, and resulting waste products. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials, and for killing any unused microorganisms before disposing of them, comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources.\nDuring the course of the product life cycle we will make process changes to scale up manufacturing to commercial manufacture or transfer the production to alternate sites or contract manufacturers. Our ability to successfully implement these changes will depend on our ability to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the FDA and other regulatory agencies that the product made by the new process or at the new site is comparable to the original product.\nIn the event that manufacturing process changes are necessary for the further development of a product candidate, we may not be able to reach agreement with regulatory agencies on the criteria for\ndemonstrating comparability to the original product, which would require us to repeat clinical studies performed with the original product. This could result in lengthy delays in implementing the new process or site and consequent delays in regulatory approval and commercial sales of product derived from the new process. If we reach agreement with regulatory agencies on the criteria for establishing comparability, we may not be able to meet these criteria or may suffer lengthy delays in meeting these criteria. This may result in significant lost sales due to inability to meet commercial demand with the original product. Furthermore, studies to demonstrate comparability, or any other studies on the new process or site such as validation studies, may uncover findings that result in regulatory agencies delaying or refusing to approve the new process or site.\nRisks Relating to Our Joint Venture Agreement\nIf our joint venture with Hepalink is not successful or if we fail to realize the benefits we anticipate from such joint venture, we may not be able to capitalize on the full market potential of our products in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.\nWe entered into a Joint Venture Contract, as amended effective August 6, 2018, or the JV Agreement, with Shenzhen Hepalink Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd., a People\u2019s Republic of China company, or Hepalink, a related party and significant shareholder in the Company, pursuant to which we formed a Joint Venture company named Shenzhen Arimab BioPharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., or SABC, a People\u2019s Republic of China Company, develop, manufacture, import and distribute AR-101, AR-301 and AR-105 in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, collectively, referred to as the Territory. The Joint Venture received regulatory approval in China and SABC was formed on July 2, 2018.\nHepalink contributed the equivalent of $7.2 million in renminbi, the official currency of the People\u2019s Republic of China, and owns 51% of the capital of SABC and we contributed (i) $1.0 million in cash and (ii) a license to AR-101, AR-301 and AR-105 pursuant to an Amended and Restated Technology License and Collaboration Agreement between us and SABC and we own 49% of the capital of SABC. It was agreed by the parties that we shall be reimbursed for certain legal and contract manufacturing expenses related to the clinical drug supply for a Phase 3 clinical study of AR-301 and the clinical drug supply for a clinical study of AR-105. In addition, Hepalink will provide SABC with clinical and regulatory personnel services for clinical and regulatory review, application and filing procedures in the Territory and we will provide clinical and regulatory personnel services to assist in coordination of the execution of the clinical study in China and also with CMC personnel services for drug supply and manufacturing planning. Hepalink is obligated to make an additional equity investment of $10.8 million into SABC in connection with a future financing of SABC provided that (i) such financing does not occur earlier than January 1, 2019, (ii) top-line clinical results of the first global AR-301 Phase 3 study are available, (iii) CFDA approval for a Phase 3 clinical trial in China is granted, (iv) we have not breached the Amended and Restated Technology License and Collaboration Agreement and (v) the SABC Board has approved such financing. If and to the extent these milestone events occur and Hepalink contributes additional capital to SABC, our 49% ownership stake in SABC will be diminished in proportion to such investment.\nWhile SABC is obligated to use its commercially best efforts to commercialize our products and product candidates in the Territory, we have limited contractual rights to direct its activities. Hepalink has the majority of the voting equity in SABC and has the right to designate three of five board seats. Therefore, Hepalink may have a greater influence in the commercialization efforts and other operations of SABC. In general, our joint venture with Hepalink subjects us to a number of related risks including that:\n\u2022\nSABC may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of our products in the Territory;\n\u2022\nSABC may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and other potential liability;\n\u2022\nour obligation to contribute $1.0 million in cash to SABC, as long as we remain a shareholder of SABC, may not be transferred back to us or converted into USD and thus, may only be used for goods and services in China;\n\u2022\ndisputes may arise among SABC, Hepalink and us that result in the delay or termination of the commercialization of our products or product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources; and\n\u2022\nSABC may not provide us with timely and accurate information regarding commercialization status or results, which could adversely impact our ability to manage our own commercialization efforts, accurately forecast financial results or provide timely information to our shareholders regarding our commercialization efforts in the Territory.\nWhile we believe that our board representation, voting rights and other contractual rights with respect to SABC serve to mitigate some of these risks, we may have disagreements with the other directors and Hepalink that could impair our ability to influence SABC to act in a manner that we believe is in the best interests of our company. Upon the completion of certain milestone events, Hepalink will become obligated to acquire additional shares of SABC, the proceeds of which would be received by SABC in exchange for newly issued shares. We may not be able to access the funds for our own operations.\nThe laws of the People\u2019s Republic of China, which govern SABC\u2019s management and operations, may not offer the same protections afforded to minority stockholders under the Delaware General Corporation Law. Consequently, SABC may make business decisions that are not in our best interests as minority equity holders.\nRisks Relating to Competitive Factors\nWe compete in an industry characterized by extensive research and development efforts and rapid technological progress. New discoveries or commercial developments by our competitors could render our potential products obsolete or non-competitive.\nNew developments occur and are expected to continue to occur at a rapid pace in our industry, and there can be no assurance that discoveries or commercial developments by our competitors will not render some or all of our potential products obsolete or non-competitive, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. New data from commercial and clinical-stage products continue to emerge and it is possible that these data may alter current standards of care, completely precluding us from further developing our product candidates or preventing us from getting them approved by regulatory agencies. Further, it is possible that we may initiate a clinical trial or trials for our product candidates, only to find that data from competing products make it impossible for us to complete enrollment in these trials, resulting in our inability to file for marketing approval with regulatory agencies. Even if these products are approved for marketing in a particular indication or indications, they may have limited sales due to particularly intense competition in these markets.\nWe expect to compete with fully integrated and well-established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the near- and long-term. Most of these companies have substantially greater financial, research and development, manufacturing and marketing experience and resources than we do and represent substantial long-term competition for us. Such companies may succeed in discovering and developing pharmaceutical products more rapidly than we do or pharmaceutical products that are safer, more effective or less costly than any that we may develop. Such companies also may be more successful than we are in manufacturing, sales and marketing. Smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large pharmaceutical and established biotechnology companies. Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also conduct clinical trials, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for the development of product candidates.\nWe expect competition among products will be based on product efficacy and safety, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, availability of supply, marketing and sales capabilities, reimbursement coverage, price and patent position. There can be no assurance that our competitors will not develop safer and more effective products, commercialize products earlier than we do, or obtain patent protection or intellectual property rights that limit our ability to commercialize our products.\nThere can be no assurance that our issued patents or pending patent applications, if issued, will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with proprietary protection or a competitive advantage.\nOur competitors may develop and market products that are less expensive, more effective, safer or reach the market sooner than our product candidates, which may diminish or eliminate the commercial success of any products we may commercialize.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. There are many public and private biopharmaceutical companies, public and private universities and research organizations actively engaged in the discovery and research and development of products for infectious disease. Several companies are developing mAbs to treat infections, including Merck & Co., AstraZeneca, and Alopexx Enterprises, LLC.\nThere is no assurance, however, that another company will not discover how to successfully develop these antibodies for competing indications.\nAmong current antimicrobial therapies, antibiotics, particularly those administered by inhalation, can be competitors to our products especially Panaecin for lung infections. TOBI, an inhaled antibiotic (tobramycin) has the longest treatment history, although Cayston (inhaled aztreonam) was recently approved for lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. There are antibiotics being developed for gram-positive or gram-negative bacterial infections that could impact the use of standard of care antibiotics in hospitals. These therapies could impact both the clinical results and use of our products being developed for hospital acquired pneumonia.\nMany of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic collaborators, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of drugs, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals, and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful in obtaining approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors\u2019 drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the significant expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available.\nWe also compete with other clinical-stage companies and institutions for clinical trial participants, which could reduce our ability to recruit participants for our clinical trials. Delay in recruiting clinical trial participants could adversely affect our ability to bring a product to market prior to our competitors. Further, research and discoveries by others may result in breakthroughs that render our product candidates obsolete even before they begin to generate any revenue.\nIn addition, our competitors may obtain patent protection or FDA approval and commercialize products more rapidly than we do, which may impact future sales of any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval. If the FDA approves the commercial sale of any of our product candidates, we will also be competing with respect to marketing capabilities and manufacturing efficiency, areas in which we have limited or no experience. We expect competition among products will be based on product efficacy and safety, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, availability of supply, marketing and sales capabilities, product price, reimbursement coverage by government and private third-party payors, and patent position. Our profitability and financial position will suffer if our products receive regulatory approval but cannot compete effectively in the marketplace.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved and commercialized, we may face competition from biosimilars. The route to market for biosimilars was established with the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, in March 2010, providing 12 years of marketing exclusivity for reference products and an additional six months of exclusivity if pediatric studies are conducted. In the EU, the EMA has issued guidelines for approving products through an abbreviated pathway, and biosimilars have been approved. If a biosimilar version of one of our potential products were approved in the U.S. or EU, it could have a negative effect on sales and gross profits of the potential product and our financial condition.\nEven if we achieve market acceptance for our products, we may experience downward pricing pressure on the price of our drugs because of generic and biosimilar competition and social pressure to lower the cost of drugs.\nSeveral of the FDA approved products for infectious diseases face patent expiration in the next several years. As a result, generic versions and biosimilars of these drugs and biologicals may become\navailable. We expect to face competition from these products, including price-based competition. Pressure from government and private reimbursement groups, plus patient awareness and other social activist groups to reduce drug prices may also put downward pressure on the prices of drugs, including our product candidates, if they are commercialized. Also, if a biosimilar to any of our product candidates is approved by regulatory agencies, there will be significant pricing pressure on our products, causing us or our collaborators to reduce the sales price of our products.\nOur product candidates may not be accepted in the marketplace; therefore, we may not be able to generate significant revenue, if any.\nEven if our product candidates are approved for sale, physicians and the medical community may not ultimately use them or may use them only in applications more restricted than we expect. Our product candidates, if successfully developed, will compete with a number of traditional products, including antibiotics, and immunotherapies manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical and other biotechnology companies. Our product candidates will also compete with new products currently under development by such companies and others. Physicians will prescribe a product only if they determine, based on experience, clinical data, side effect profiles, reimbursement for their patients and other factors, that it is beneficial as compared to other products currently in use. Furthermore, physicians have been prescribing traditional antibiotics for decades and may be resistant to switching to new, less established therapies. Many other factors influence the adoption of new products, including marketing and distribution restrictions, course of treatment, adverse publicity, product pricing, the views of thought leaders in the medical community and reimbursement by government and private third-party payors.\nRisks Relating to our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and our clinical trials and to store and distribute our products for the clinical trials we conduct. If these third parties do not perform as contractually required or expected, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, or we may be delayed in doing so.\nWe often rely on third parties, such as CROs, medical institutions, academic institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories, to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. We are responsible for confirming that our preclinical studies are conducted in accordance with applicable regulations and that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its general investigational plan and protocol. The FDA requires us to comply with Good Laboratory Practice for conducting and recording the results of our preclinical studies and Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials, to ensure that data and reported results are accurate and that the clinical trial participants are adequately protected. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities. If the third parties conducting our clinical trials do not perform their contractual duties or obligations, do not meet expected deadlines, fail to comply with GCP, do not adhere to our clinical trial protocols or otherwise fail to generate reliable clinical data, we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties and our clinical trials may be more costly than expected or budgeted, extended, delayed or terminated or may need to be repeated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize the product candidate being tested in such trials.\nOur CROs are not our employees, and we are therefore unable to directly monitor whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our clinical and preclinical programs. These CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials or other product development activities that could harm our competitive position. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements, or for any other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, our therapeutic candidates. If any such event were to occur, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our therapeutic candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. Further, switching or adding additional CROs involves additional costs and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays occur, which could materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nIn addition, our future clinical trials will require a sufficient number of test subjects to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our therapeutic candidates. Accordingly, if our CROs fail to comply with these regulations or fail to recruit a sufficient number of patients, we may be required to repeat such clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nWe also rely on other third parties to store and distribute our products for the clinical trials that we conduct. Any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our therapeutic candidates or commercialization of our products, if approved, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nWe may explore new strategic collaborations that may never materialize or may fail.\nWe may, in the future, periodically explore a variety of new strategic collaborations in an effort to gain access to additional product candidates or resources. At the current time, we cannot predict what form such a strategic collaboration might take. We are likely to face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic collaborators, and these strategic collaborations can be complicated and time-consuming to negotiate and document. We may not be able to negotiate strategic collaborations on acceptable terms, or at all. We are unable to predict when, if ever, we will enter into any additional strategic collaborations because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with establishing strategic collaborations.\nRisks Relating to our Exposure to Litigation\nWe are exposed to potential product liability or similar claims, and insurance against these claims may not be available to us at a reasonable rate in the future.\nOur business exposes us to potential liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of human therapeutic products. Clinical trials involve the testing of product candidates on human subjects or volunteers under a research plan and carry a risk of liability for personal injury or death to patients due to unforeseen adverse side effects, improper administration of the product candidate, or other factors. Many of these patients are already seriously ill and are therefore particularly vulnerable to further illness or death.\nWe believe we have adequate levels of clinical trial liability insurance for our domestic and international clinical trials. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such insurance or that the amount of such insurance will be adequate to cover claims. We could be materially and adversely affected if we were required to pay damages or incur defense costs in connection with a claim outside the scope of indemnity or insurance coverage, if the indemnity is not performed or enforced in accordance with its terms, or if our liability exceeds the amount of applicable insurance. In addition, there can be no assurance that insurance will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all, or that if obtained, the insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover any potential claims or liabilities. Similar risks would exist upon the commercialization or marketing of any products by us or our collaborators.\nRegardless of their merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our product;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial volunteers;\n\u2022\ncosts of litigation;\n\u2022\ndistraction of management; and\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to plaintiffs.\nShould any of these events occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to the Company.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that we will indemnify our directors to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.\nIn addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our bylaws provide that:\n\u2022\nwe may, in our discretion, indemnify other officers, employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law;\n\u2022\nwe are required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and executive officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such directors or executive officers shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification;\n\u2022\nwe will not be obligated pursuant to our bylaws to indemnify any director or executive officer in connection with any proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless (i) such indemnification is expressly required to be made by law, (ii) the proceeding was authorized by our Board of Directors, (iii) such indemnification is provided by us, in our sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the corporation under applicable law or (iv) such indemnification is required to be made pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws;\n\u2022\nthe rights conferred in our bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons; and\n\u2022\nwe may not retroactively amend our bylaw provisions to reduce our indemnification obligations to directors, officers, employees and agents.\nAs a result, if we are required to indemnify one or more of our directors or executive officers, it may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us, may reduce the amount of money available to us and may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Regulation of Our Industry\nThe biopharmaceutical industry is subject to significant regulation and oversight in the United States, in addition to approval of products for sale and marketing. We may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, transparency, health information privacy and security laws and other healthcare laws and regulations. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any future product candidates we may develop and any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of biopharmaceutical products, we are exposed, directly, or indirectly, through our customers, to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may affect the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we would market, sell and distribute our products. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute which prohibits any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in-kind, to induce or reward either the referring of an individual for, or the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any health care item or service\nreimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or any other federally financed healthcare program. The term \u201cremuneration\u201d has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other hand. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from federal Anti-Kickback Statute liability.\nThe federal false claims and civil monetary penalty laws, including the Federal False Claims Act, which imposes significant penalties and can be enforced by private citizens through civil qui tam actions, prohibits any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, using or causing to be made, a false statement or record material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the Federal False Claims Act. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes \u201cany request or demand\u201d for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Further, manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to \u201ccause\u201d the submission of false or fraudulent claims. Criminal prosecution is also possible for making or presenting a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government. Several pharmaceutical and other health care companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.\nThe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which, among other things, imposes criminal liability for executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and creates federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security, transmission and breach reporting of individually identifiable health information upon entities subject to the law, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers and their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in U.S. federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.\nThe federal physician payment transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the \u201cPhysician Payments Sunshine Act,\u201d and its implementing regulations, which require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.\nState and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may impose similar or more prohibitive restrictions, and may apply to items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.\nState laws that require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs, comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or to track and report gifts, compensation and other remuneration provided to physicians and other healthcare providers, state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, and other federal, state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information or personally identifiable information in certain circumstances, including state health information privacy and data breach notification laws which govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus requiring additional compliance efforts.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws. The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry.\nEnsuring that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will likely be costly and time consuming. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from governmental funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, provide accurate information to the FDA, comply with manufacturing standards we have established, comply with federal and state health-care fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from governmental funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws.\nHealth care reform measures could adversely affect our business.\nIn the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. In 2010, the PPACA was enacted, which includes measures to significantly change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the PPACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are the following:\n\u2022\nan annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;\n\u2022\nimplementation of the federal physician payment transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the \u201cPhysician Payments Sunshine Act\u201d;\n\u2022\na licensure framework for follow-on biologic products;\n\u2022\na new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;\n\u2022\nestablishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending;\n\u2022\nan increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP;\n\u2022\na new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for certain drugs and biologics, including our product candidates, that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;\n\u2022\nextension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u2022\nexpansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability;\n\u2022\na new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers\u2019 outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and\n\u2022\nexpansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health program.\nThere have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. For example, President Trump signed Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the PPACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the PPACA. Concurrently, Congress considered legislation to repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the PPACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the PPACA have been enacted. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) included a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year. Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the PPACA-mandated \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and the medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurance tax. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (the \u201cBBA\u201d) among other things, amends the\nPPACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the \u201cdonut hole.\u201d Congress may consider other legislation to repeal or replace other elements of the PPACA. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the PPACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the PPACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing this case, but it is unclear when a decision will be made. Although the U.S. Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the PPACA, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the PPACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the PPACA and our business.\nMany of the details regarding the implementation of the PPACA are yet to be determined, and at this time, the full effect that the PPACA would have on our business remains unclear. In particular, there is uncertainty surrounding the applicability of the biosimilars provisions under the PPACA to our product candidates. The FDA has issued several guidance documents, and withdrawn others, but no implementing regulations on biosimilars have been adopted. A number of biosimilar applications have been approved over the past few years. It is not certain that we will receive 12 years of biologics marketing exclusivity for any of our products. The regulations that are ultimately promulgated and their implementation are likely to have considerable impact on the way we conduct our business and may require us to change current strategies. A biosimilar is a biological product that is highly similar to an approved drug notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the approved drug in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product.\nAdditionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products.\nIn addition, given recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of healthcare, Congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on healthcare reform, the cost of prescription drugs and biologics and the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. While we cannot predict the full outcome of any such legislation, it may result in decreased reimbursement for drugs and biologics, which may further exacerbate industry-wide pressure to reduce prescription drug prices. This could harm our ability to generate revenues. Increases in importation or re-importation of pharmaceutical products from foreign countries into the United States could put competitive pressure on our ability to profitably price our products, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. We might elect not to seek approval for or market our products in foreign jurisdictions in order to minimize the risk of re-importation, which could also reduce the revenue we generate from our product sales. It is also possible that other legislative proposals having similar effects will be adopted.\nFurthermore, regulatory authorities\u2019 assessment of the data and results required to demonstrate safety and efficacy can change over time and can be affected by many factors, such as the emergence of new information, including on other products, changing policies and agency funding, staffing and leadership. We cannot be sure whether future changes to the regulatory environment will be favorable or unfavorable to our business prospects. For example, average review times at the FDA for marketing approval applications can be affected by a variety of factors, including budget and funding levels and statutory, regulatory and policy changes.\nRisks Relating to Protecting our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to protect our proprietary rights or to defend against infringement claims, we may not be able to compete effectively or operate profitably.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and maintain trade secrets or other proprietary know-how, both in the United States and other countries. Patent matters in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries can be highly uncertain, can involve changes in laws or regulations, and involve complex legal and factual questions. Accordingly, the issuance, validity, breadth and enforceability of our patents and the existence of potentially blocking patent rights of others cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty, either in the United States or in other countries.\nObtaining, maintaining, and enforcing patents is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications, or maintain, enforce and/or license patents that may issue based on our patent applications, at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development results before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, in some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology that we license from or license to third parties and are reliant on our licensors or licensees. Further, although we enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to patentable aspects of our research and development output, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract research organizations, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties, any of these parties may breach these agreements and disclose such results before a patent application is filed, thereby jeopardizing our ability to seek patent protection.\nThere can be no assurance that we will discover or develop patentable products or processes or that patents will issue from any of the currently pending patent applications or that claims granted on issued patents will be sufficient to protect our technologies, processes, or adequately cover the actual products we may actually sell. Potential competitors or other researchers in the field may have filed patent applications, been issued patents, published articles or otherwise created prior art that could restrict or block our efforts to obtain additional patents or act as obstacles to our pending patent applications. There also can be no assurance that our issued patents or pending patent applications, if issued, will not be challenged, invalidated, rendered unenforceable or not infringed, or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages. We may not be aware of all third-party intellectual property rights potentially relating to our product candidates or their intended uses, and as a result the impact of such third-party intellectual property rights upon the patentability of our own patents and patent applications, as well as the impact of such third-party intellectual property upon our freedom to operate, is highly uncertain. Patent applications in the U.S. and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing or, in some cases, not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our patents or pending patent applications may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the U.S. and abroad. For example, we may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or become involved in post-grant review procedures, oppositions, derivations, reexaminations, inter partes review or interference proceedings, in the U.S. or elsewhere, challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated, or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. In addition, given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. The patent position of biopharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation, resulting in court decisions, including Supreme Court decisions, that have increased uncertainties as to the ability to enforce patent rights in the future. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the\nU.S., or vice versa. Our patent rights also depend on our compliance with technology and patent licenses upon which our patent rights are based and upon the validity of assignments of patent rights from consultants and other inventors that were, or are, not employed by us.\nIn addition, competitors may manufacture and sell our potential products in those foreign countries where we have not filed for patent protection or where patent protection may be unavailable, not obtainable or ultimately not enforceable or meaningful. In addition, even where patent protection is obtained, third-party competitors may challenge our patent claims in the various patent offices, for example via opposition in the European Patent Office or reexamination or interference proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, or find ways to design around our patents by producing competitive non-infringing alternative products. The ability of such competitors to sell such products in the United States or in foreign countries where we have obtained patents is usually governed by the patent laws of the countries in which the product is sold.\nWe will incur significant ongoing expenses in maintaining our patent portfolio in addition to maintaining other registered intellectual property such as trademarks and copyrights. Maintaining registered intellectual property such as patents and trademarks requires timely filing certain maintenance documents and paying certain maintenance fees, the failure of which could result in abandonment or cancellation of such registered intellectual property. Should we lack the funds to maintain our patent portfolio or other registered intellectual property, or to enforce our rights against infringers, we could be adversely impacted. Even if we succeed in enforcing one of our patents against a third-party in a claim of infringement, any such action could divert the time and attention of management and impair our ability to access additional capital and/or cost us significant funds.\nIf we cannot meet requirements under our license and sublicense agreements, we could lose the rights to our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend on licensing and sublicensing agreements with third parties such as the University of Chicago, University of Iowa, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Inc., Brigham Young University, Public Health Service and Kenta Biotech Ltd to maintain the intellectual property rights to certain of our product candidates. These agreements require us to make payments and satisfy performance obligations in order to maintain our rights under these agreements. All of these agreements last either throughout the life of the patents that are the subject of the agreements, or with respect to other licensed technology, for a number of years after the first commercial sale of the relevant product. If we fail to comply with the obligations under our license agreements or use the intellectual property licensed to us in an unauthorized manner, we may be required to pay damages and our licensors may have the right to terminate the license. If our license agreements are terminated, we may not be able to develop, manufacture, market or sell the products covered by our agreements and those being tested or approved in combination with such products. Such an occurrence could materially adversely affect the value of the product candidate being developed under any such agreement and any other product candidates being developed or tested in combination.\nIn addition, we are responsible for the cost of filing and prosecuting certain patent applications and maintaining certain issued patents licensed to us. If we do not meet our obligations under our license agreements in a timely manner, or use the intellectual property licensed to us in an unauthorized manner, we could be required to pay damages and we could lose the rights to our proprietary technology if our licensor terminated the license. If our license agreements are terminated, we may not be able to develop, manufacture, market or sell the products covered by our agreements and any being tested or approved in combination with such products. Such an occurrence could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u2022\nothers may be able to make compounds that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors or strategic collaborators might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors or strategic collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nit is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n\u2022\nissued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;\n\u2022\nour competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u2022\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and\n\u2022\nthe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nShould any of these events occur, they could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nPatent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nChanges in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and Ex-US could increase the uncertainties and costs. Recent patent reform legislation in the United States and other countries, including the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, signed into law in the United States on September 16, 2011, could increase those uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art and provide more efficient and cost-effective avenues for competitors to challenge the validity of patents. These include allowing third-party submission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution and additional procedures to attack the validity of a patent by USPTO administered post-grant proceedings, including post-grant review, inter partes review, and derivation proceedings. After March 2013, under the Leahy-Smith Act, the United States transitioned to a first inventor to file system in which, assuming that the other statutory requirements are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether a third-party was the first to invent the claimed invention. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the U.S. courts, the USPTO and the relevant law-making bodies in other countries, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nWe may be subject to litigation with respect to the ownership and use of intellectual property that will be costly to defend or pursue and uncertain in its outcome.\nOur success also will depend, in part, on our refraining from infringing patents or otherwise violating intellectual property owned or controlled by others. There is a substantial amount of intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and we may become party to, or threatened with, litigation or other adversarial proceedings regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our\nproducts candidates, including interference proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, universities, research institutions and others may have filed patent applications or have received, or may obtain, issued patents in the United States or elsewhere relating to aspects of our technology, and it may not always be clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. Third parties may allege that we have infringed or misappropriated their intellectual property. If we were sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our product candidates, products or methods either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid or unenforceable, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity is difficult. For example, in the United States, proving invalidity requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents. Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel could be diverted in pursuing these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion.\nLitigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims, with or without merit, is unpredictable and generally expensive and time consuming and, even if resolved in our favor, is likely to divert significant resources from our core business, including distracting our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources and more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios.\nIf we are found to infringe a third-party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be forced, including by court order, to cease developing, manufacturing or commercializing the infringing product candidate or product. Alternatively, we may be required to obtain a license from such third-party in order to use the infringing technology and continue developing, manufacturing or marketing the infringing product candidate. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nIt is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patents will require us to alter our products or processes, obtain licenses, if such licenses are available on commercially reasonable terms, or cease certain activities completely. Some third-party applications or patents may conflict with our issued patents or pending applications. Any such conflict could result in a significant reduction of the scope or value of our issued or licensed patents.\nIn addition, if patents issued to other companies contain blocking, dominating or conflicting claims and such claims are ultimately determined to be valid, we may be required to obtain licenses to these patents or to develop or obtain alternative non-infringing technology and cease practicing those activities, including potentially manufacturing or selling any products deemed to infringe those patents. If any licenses are required, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such licenses on commercially favorable terms, if at all, and if these licenses are not obtained, we might be prevented from pursuing the development and commercialization of certain of our potential products. Our failure to obtain a license to any technology that we may require to commercialize our products on favorable terms may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLitigation, which could result in substantial costs to us (even if determined in our favor), may also be necessary to enforce any patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against any accusations from third parties that our products or activities are infringing their intellectual property rights. The FDA has only recently published draft guidance documents for implementation of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA under the PPACA, related to the development of follow-on biologics (biosimilars), and detailed guidance for patent litigation procedures under this act has not yet been provided. If another company files for approval to market a competing follow-on biologic, and/or if such approval is given to such a company, we may be required to promptly initiate patent litigation to prevent the marketing of such biosimilar version of our product prior to the normal expiration of the patent. There can be no assurance that our issued or licensed patents would be held valid by a court of competent jurisdiction or that any follow-on biologic would be found to infringe our patents.\nIn addition, if our competitors file or have filed patent applications in the United States that claim technology also claimed by us, we may have to participate in interference proceedings to determine priority of invention. These proceedings, if initiated by the USPTO, could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. Such proceedings can be lengthy, are costly to defend and involve complex questions of law and fact, the outcomes of which are difficult to predict. Moreover, we may have to participate in post-grant proceedings or third-party ex parte or inter partes reexamination proceedings under the USPTO. An adverse outcome with respect to a third-party claim or in an interference proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to license disputed rights from third parties, or require us to cease using such technology, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming and divert the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents, in addition to counterclaims asserting that our patents are invalid or unenforceable, or both. In any patent infringement proceeding, there is a risk that a court will decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention at issue. There is also a risk that, even if the validity of such patents is upheld, the court will construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly or decide that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention at issue on the grounds that our patent claims do not cover the invention. An adverse outcome in a litigation or proceeding involving our patents could limit our ability to assert our patents against those parties or other competitors and may curtail or preclude our ability to exclude third parties from making and selling similar or competitive products. Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our competitive business position, business prospects and financial condition. Similarly, if we assert trademark infringement claims, a court may determine that the marks we have asserted are invalid or unenforceable, or that the party against whom we have asserted trademark infringement has superior rights to the marks in question. In this case, we could ultimately be forced to cease use of such trademarks.\nEven if we establish infringement, the court may decide not to grant an injunction against further infringing activity and instead award only monetary damages, which may or may not be an adequate remedy. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of shares of our common stock. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are concluded. Even if we ultimately prevail in such claims, the monetary cost of such litigation and the diversion of the attention of our management and scientific personnel could outweigh any benefit we receive as a result of the proceedings.\nWe may rely on trade secret and proprietary know-how which can be difficult to trace and enforce and, if we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nWe also rely on trade secrets to protect technology, especially where patent protection is not believed to be appropriate or obtainable or where patents have not issued. For example, our manufacturing process involves a number of trade secret steps, processes, and conditions. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We attempt to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, with confidentiality agreements and assignment of invention agreements with our employees and confidentiality agreements with our consultants and certain contractors. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Any disclosure, either intentional or unintentional, by our employees, the employees of third parties with whom we share our facilities or third-party consultants and vendors that we engage to perform research, clinical studies or manufacturing activities, or misappropriation by third parties (such as through a cybersecurity breach) of our trade secrets or proprietary information could enable competitors to duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, thus eroding our competitive position in our market.\nEnforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor or other third-party, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor or other third-party, our competitive position would be harmed.\nThere can be no assurance that these agreements are valid and enforceable, will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. We may fail in certain circumstances to obtain the necessary confidentiality agreements or assignment of invention agreements, or their scope or term may not be sufficiently broad to protect our interests or transfer adequate rights to us.\nIf our trade secrets or other intellectual property become known to our competitors, it could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To the extent that we or our consultants or research collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in work for us, disputes may also arise as to the rights to related or resulting know-how and inventions.\nThe patent protection and patent prosecution for some of our product candidates is dependent or may be dependent in the future on third parties.\nWhile we normally seek and gain the right to fully prosecute the patents relating to our product candidates, there may be times when platform technology patents or product-specific patents that relate to our product candidates are controlled by our licensors. In addition, our licensors and/or licensees may have back-up rights to prosecute patent applications in the event that we do not do so or choose not to do so, and our licensees may have the right to assume patent prosecution rights after certain milestones are reached. If any of our licensing collaborators fails to appropriately prosecute and maintain patent protection for patents covering any of our product candidates, our ability to develop and commercialize those product candidates may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nPatents are of national or regional effect, and filing, prosecuting and defending patents on all of our product candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. As such, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Further, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to\npharmaceuticals or biologics, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. In addition, certain developing countries, including China and India, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we and our licensors may have limited remedies if patents are infringed or if we or our licensors are compelled to grant a license to a third-party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time.\nPatent rights are of limited duration. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such product candidates are commercialized. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired for a product, we may be open to competition from biosimilar or generic products. A patent term extension based on regulatory delay may be available in the U.S. However, only a single patent can be extended for each marketing approval, and any patent can be extended only once, for a single product. Moreover, the scope of protection during the period of the patent term extension does not extend to the full scope of the claim, but instead only to the scope of the product as approved. Laws governing analogous patent term extensions in foreign jurisdictions vary widely, as do laws governing the ability to obtain multiple patents from a single patent family. Additionally, we may not receive an extension if we fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration, or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we will have the right to exclusively market our product will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration, and our revenue could be reduced, possibly materially.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees or we have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nSome of our employees and our licensors\u2019 employees, including our senior management, were previously employed at universities or at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Some of these employees may have executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements, or similar agreements, in connection with such previous employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such third-party. Litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel or sustain damages. Such intellectual property rights could be awarded to a third-party, and we could be required to obtain a license from such third-party to commercialize our technology or products. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIn addition, while we typically require our employees, consultants and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own, which may result in claims by or against us related to the ownership of such intellectual property. If we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our senior management and scientific personnel.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submissions, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our product candidates, our competitive position would be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Owning our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially.\nYou should consider an investment in our common stock to be risky, and you should invest in our common stock only if you can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuations in the market value of your investment. Some factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, in addition to the other risks mentioned in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, are:\n\u2022\nsale of our common stock by our stockholders, executives, and directors;\n\u2022\nvolatility and limitations in trading volumes of our shares of common stock;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain financings to conduct and complete research and development activities including, but not limited to, our human clinical trials, and other business activities;\n\u2022\nour announcements or our competitors\u2019announcements regarding new products or services, enhancements, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments;\n\u2022\nfailures to meet external expectations or management guidance;\n\u2022\nclinical trial progress and outcomes;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure or dividend policy;\n\u2022\nour cash position and substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern;\n\u2022\nannouncements and events surrounding financing efforts, including debt and equity securities;\n\u2022\nour inability to enter into new markets or develop new products;\n\u2022\nreputational issues;\n\u2022\nannouncements of acquisitions, partnerships, collaborations, joint ventures, new products, capital commitments, or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic, political and market conditions in any of the regions in which we conduct our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in industry conditions or perceptions;\n\u2022\nchanges in valuations of similar companies or groups of companies;\n\u2022\nanalyst research reports, recommendation and changes in recommendations, price targets, and withdrawals of coverage;\n\u2022\ndepartures and additions of key personnel;\n\u2022\ndisputes and litigations related to contractual obligations;\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable laws, rules, regulations, or accounting practices and other dynamics;\n\u2022\ncatastrophic weather and/or global disease outbreaks, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic; and or\n\u2022\nother events or factors, many of which may be out of our control.\nIn addition, if the market for stocks in our industry or industries related to our industry, or the stock market in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management.\nThe stock market in general has recently experienced relatively large price and volume fluctuations, particularly in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. In particular, the market prices of securities of smaller biotechnology and medical device companies have experienced dramatic fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating results of these companies. Continued market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the price of our common stock, which could cause a decline in the value of our common stock. In addition, price volatility may increase if the trading volume of our common stock remains limited or declines\nOur 10% or more stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our executive officers, directors and 10% or more stockholders, together with their respective affiliates, beneficially owned approximately 29.1% of our outstanding securities. Accordingly, this group of security holders will be able to exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and over matters requiring security holder approval, including the election of our Board of Directors, future issuances of our securities, declaration of dividends and approval of other significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change-of-control of the Company or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could have a material and adverse effect on the fair market value of our securities. In addition, this significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock if investors perceive disadvantages in owning stock in a company with such concentrated ownership.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carry-forwards and certain other tax attributes is limited by Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nNet operating loss carryforwards allow companies to use past year net operating losses to offset against future years\u2019 profits, if any, to reduce future tax liabilities. Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 limit a corporation\u2019s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes (including research credits) to offset any future taxable income or tax if the corporation experiences a cumulative ownership change of more than 50% over any rolling three year period. State net operating loss carryforwards (and certain other tax attributes) may be similarly limited. An ownership change can therefore result in significantly greater tax liabilities than a corporation would incur in the absence of such a change and any increased liabilities could adversely affect the corporation\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nOwnership changes may occur in the future as a result of additional equity offerings or events over which we will have little or no control, including purchases and sales of our equity by our five percent security holders, the emergence of new five percent security holders, redemptions of our securities or certain changes in the ownership of any of our five percent security holders.\nU.S. federal income tax reform could adversely affect us.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act,\u201d or TCJA, that significantly reforms the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The TCJA, among other things, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of\ninterest, allows for the expensing of capital expenditures, a reduction to the maximum deduction allowed for net operating losses generated in tax years after December 31, 2017, and puts into effect the migration from a \u201cworldwide\u201d system of taxation to a partially territorial system. We do not expect tax reform to have a material impact to our projection of minimal cash taxes or to our net operating losses. Our net deferred tax assets and liabilities will be revalued at the newly enacted U.S. corporate rate, and the impact will be recognized in our tax expense in the year of enactment. Further, any eligibility we may have or may someday have for tax credits associated with the qualified clinical testing expenses arising out of the development of orphan drugs will be reduced to 25% as a result of the TCJA; thus, our net taxable income may be affected. We continue to examine the impact this tax reform legislation may have on our business. The impact of this tax reform on holders of our common stock is uncertain and could be adverse. This annual report on Form 10-K does not discuss any such tax legislation or the manner in which it might affect purchasers of our common stock. We urge our stockholders, to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to such legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in our common stock.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock pursuant to our equity incentive plan could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our share price to fall.\nWe expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations, including expanding research and development, funding clinical trials, purchasing of capital equipment, hiring new personnel, commercializing our products, and continuing activities as an operating public company. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner, we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our shares of common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our shares.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the increase, if any, of our share price.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and will be able to avail ourselves of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are electing to delay such adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result of such election, our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of other public companies. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We will remain an \u201cemerging\ngrowth company\u201d until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our initial public offering; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nBecause we have elected to defer compliance with new or revised accounting standards, our financial statement disclosure may not be comparable to similar companies.\nWe have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. This allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of our election, our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nBecause of this extended transition period, we may be less attractive to investors and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. Investors may be unable to compare our business with other companies in our industry if they believe that our financial accounting is not as transparent as other companies in our industry. If we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be at risk of securities class action litigation.\nWe may be at risk of securities class action litigation. This risk is especially relevant for us due to our dependence on positive clinical trial outcomes and regulatory approvals of each of our product candidates. In the past, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility, particularly when associated with binary events such as clinical trials and product approvals. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business and results in a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nOur management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a newly formed entity. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and The Nasdaq Capital Market, have imposed various new requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these new compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly. We expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage.\nOur common stock may be delisted if we fail to comply with continued listing standards.\nIf we fail to meet any of the continued listing standards of The Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock could be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market. These continued listing standards include specifically enumerated criteria, such as:\n\u2022\na $1.00 minimum closing bid price;\n\u2022\nstockholders\u2019 equity of $2.5 million;\n\u2022\n500,000 shares of publicly-held common stock with a market value of at least $1 million;\n\u2022\n300 round-lot stockholders; and\n\u2022\ncompliance with Nasdaq\u2019s corporate governance requirements, as well as additional or more stringent criteria that may be applied in the exercise of Nasdaq\u2019s discretionary authority.\nIf we fail to comply with Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing standards, we may be delisted and our common stock will trade, if at all, only on the over-the-counter market, such as the OTC Bulletin Board or OTCQX market, and then only if one or more registered broker-dealer market makers comply with quotation requirements. In addition, delisting of our common stock could depress our stock price, substantially limit liquidity of our common stock and materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Finally, delisting of our common stock could result in our common stock becoming a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under the Exchange Act.\nUpon our dissolution, you may not recoup all or any portion of your investment.\nIn the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of us, whether voluntary or involuntary, the proceeds and/or our assets may not be sufficient to repay the aggregate investment you purchased in our company. In this event, you could lose some or all of your investment.\nIf we discover material weaknesses and other deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult.\nIf we fail to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, related to disclosure controls and procedures, or if we discover additional material weaknesses and other deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important in helping prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock could drop significantly. We previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which was subsequently remedied. We cannot be certain that additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls will not be discovered in the future.", "PERMNO": 18044, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ARDS"}
