Several of these risks and uncertainties, are discussed below and elsewhere in this report. This listing should not be considered as all-inclusive. These factors represent risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Other risks that we do not know about now, or that we do not currently believe are significant, could negatively impact our business or the trading price of our securities. In addition to common business risks such as theft, loss of market share and disasters, the Company is subject to special types of risk due to the nature of its business. See additional discussions about credit, interest rate, market and litigation risks in \"Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and additional information regarding legislative and regulatory risks in the \"Supervision and Regulation\" section therein.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur financial performance may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally and at other financial institutions.\nOur financial performance generally, and, in particular, the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where we operate and in the U.S. as a whole. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence, limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital, increases in inflation or interest rates, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, or a combination of these or other factors.\nIn the U.S. financial services industry, the commercial soundness of financial institutions is closely interrelated as a result of credit, trading, clearing or other relationships between the institutions. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. This is sometimes referred to as \u201csystemic risk\u201d and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges, with which we interact on a daily basis, and therefore could adversely affect us.\nFollowing the financial crisis in 2008, the financial services industry and the securities markets were materially and adversely affected by significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes and by a serious lack of liquidity, leading to substantially increased volatility in global markets and an overall loss of investor confidence. These market conditions led to the failure or merger of a number of prominent financial institutions. Financial institution failures or near-failures resulted in further losses as a consequence of defaults on securities issued by them and defaults under contracts entered into with such entities as counterparties. Furthermore, declining asset values, defaults on mortgages and consumer loans, and the lack of market and investor confidence, as well as other factors, combined to increase credit default swap spreads and to cause rating agencies to lower credit ratings in prior years. Despite recent stabilization in asset prices, and economic performance, and historically low Federal Reserve borrowing rates, there remains a risk of continued asset and economic deterioration, which may increase the cost and decrease the availability of liquidity. Additionally, some banks and other lenders suffered significant losses during the financial crisis and are now less willing and/or able to lend, even on a secured basis, because of capital and other regulatory limitations, potentially increased risks of default and the impact of declining asset values on collateral. The foregoing has significantly weakened the strength and liquidity of some financial institutions worldwide.\nIt is possible that the business environment in the U.S. will continue to be relatively weak for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that these conditions will improve in the near term. Such conditions could adversely affect the credit quality of our loans, our results of operations and our financial condition.\nThe Company is highly dependent on real estate and events that negatively impact the real estate market will hurt our business and earnings.\nThe Company is located in areas in which economic growth is largely dependent on the real estate market, and a substantial majority of our loan portfolio is secured by or otherwise dependent on real estate. A decline in real estate activity, even if less severe than occurred in 2009 and 2008, would likely cause a decline in asset and deposit growth and negatively impact our earnings and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s high concentration of CRE, construction and land development and commercial and industrial loans expose us to increased lending risks.\nCRE, construction and land development and commercial and industrial loans (including municipal and non-profit loans), comprised approximately 94% of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2014, exposed the Company to a greater risk of loss than residential real estate and consumer loans, which comprised a smaller percentage of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2014. CRE, land development, and commercial and industrial loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential loans. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one commercial loan or one credit relationship exposes us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to one residential mortgage loan. In addition, real estate construction, acquisition and development loans have certain risks that are not present in other types of loans. The primary credit risks associated with real estate construction, acquisition and development loans are underwriting, project risks and market risks. Project risks include cost overruns, borrower credit risk, project completion risk, general contractor credit risk and environmental and other hazard risks. Market risks are risks associated with the sale of completed residential and commercial units. Such risks include affordability, which means the risk that borrowers cannot obtain affordable financing, product design risk, and risks posed by competing projects. Real estate construction, acquisition and development loans also involve additional risks because funds are advanced upon the security of the project, which is of uncertain value prior to its completion, and costs may exceed realizable values in declining real estate markets.\nBecause of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs and the realizable market value of completed projects and the effects of governmental regulation of real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. As a result, real estate construction, acquisition and development loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If our appraisal of the value of the completed project proves to be overstated or market values or rental rates decline, we may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project. If we are forced to foreclose on a project prior to or at completion due to a default, there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover all of the unpaid balance and accrued interest on the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs. In addition, we may be required to fund additional amounts to complete the project and may have to hold the property for an unspecified period of time while we attempt to dispose of it. The adverse effects of the foregoing matters upon our real estate construction, acquisition and development portfolio could lead to an increase in non-performing loans related to this portfolio and these non-performing loans may result in a material level of charge-offs, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nActual credit losses may exceed the losses that we expect in our loan portfolio, which could require us to raise additional capital. If we are unable to raise additional capital, our financial condition, results of operations and capital could be materially and adversely affected.\nCredit losses are inherent in the business of making loans. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our consolidated loan portfolio and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based on a number of factors, including the size of the portfolio, asset classifications, economic trends, industry experience and trends, industry and geographic concentrations, estimated collateral values, management\u2019s assessment of the credit risk inherent in the portfolio, historical loan loss experience and loan underwriting policies. In addition, the Company evaluates all loans identified as problem loans and augments the allowance based upon its estimation of the potential loss associated with those problem loans. Additions to the allowance for credit losses recorded through the Company's provision for credit losses decrease the Company's net income. If such assumptions and judgments are incorrect, the Company's actual credit losses may exceed our allowance for credit losses.\nAt December 31, 2014, our allowance for credit losses was $110.2 million. Deterioration in the real estate market and/or general economic conditions could affect the ability of our loan customers to service their debt, which could result in additional loan provisions and increases in our allowance for credit losses. Any increases in the provision or allowance for credit losses will result in a decrease in our net income and, potentially, capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, because future events are uncertain and because we may not successfully identify all deteriorating loans in a timely manner, there may be loans that deteriorate in an accelerated time frame. If actual credit losses materially exceed our allowance for credit losses, we may be required to raise additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and capital.\nIn addition, we may be required to increase our allowance for credit losses based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions, new information regarding existing loans, input from regulators in connection with their review of our allowance, changes in regulatory guidance regulations or accounting standards, identification of additional problem loans and\nother factors, both within and outside of our management\u2019s control. Increases to our allowance for credit losses could negatively affect our financial condition and earnings.\nBecause of the geographic concentration of our assets, our business is highly susceptible to local economic conditions.\nOur business is primarily concentrated in selected markets in Arizona, California and Nevada. As a result of this geographic concentration, our financial condition and results of operations depend largely upon economic conditions in these market areas. Deterioration in economic conditions in these markets could result in one or more of the following: an increase in loan delinquencies; an increase in problem assets and foreclosures; a decrease in the demand for our products and services; or a decrease in the value of collateral for loans, especially real estate, in turn reducing customers\u2019 borrowing power, the value of assets associated with problem loans and collateral coverage.\nThe downgrade of the U.S. government\u2019s sovereign credit rating, any similar rating agency action in the future, debt crises in Europe and other countries, and downgrades of the sovereign credit ratings of several European nations could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe impact of downgrades to the U.S. government\u2019s sovereign credit rating by rating agencies, as well as any perceived credit weakness of U.S. government-related obligations, is inherently unpredictable and could adversely affect the U.S. and global financial markets and economic conditions and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nIn addition, while we don\u2019t have direct foreign exposure, certain European nations and other countries continue to experience varying degrees of financial stress. Risks related to European economic conditions have had, and are likely to continue to have, a negative impact on global economic activity and the financial markets. If these conditions persist, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s financial instruments expose it to certain market risks and may increase the volatility of reported earnings.\nThe Company holds certain financial instruments measured at fair value. For those financial instruments measured at fair value, the Company is required to recognize the changes in the fair value of such instruments in earnings. Therefore, any increases or decreases in the fair value of these financial instruments have a corresponding impact on reported earnings. Fair value can be affected by a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including our credit position, interest rate volatility, capital markets volatility and other economic factors. Accordingly, our earnings are subject to mark-to-market risk and the application of fair value accounting may cause our earnings to be more volatile than would be suggested by our underlying performance.\nIf the Company lost a significant portion of its core deposits or its cost of funding deposits increased significantly, it could negatively impact our liquidity and/or profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s profitability depends in part on successfully attracting and retaining a stable base of relatively low-cost deposits. While we generally do not believe these core deposits are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, the competition for these deposits in our markets is strong and, as economic conditions improve, customers may demand higher interest rates on their deposits or seek other investments offering higher rates of return. A reduction in our deposit balances would require us to borrow from other sources at higher rates, which could adversely impact our liquidity and profitability. The Company is a member of the Promontory Interfinancial Network, and offers its reciprocal deposit products, such as CDARS and ICS, to customers seeking federal insurance for deposit amounts that exceed the applicable deposit insurance limit at a single institution. Any event or circumstance that interferes with or limits our ability to offer these products to customers that require greater security for their deposits, such as a significant regulatory enforcement action or a significant decline in capital levels at our bank subsidiary, could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain deposits. For further discussion of CDARS and ICS, see \"Note 7. Deposits\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. If the Company were to lose a significant portion of its low-cost deposits, it would negatively impact its liquidity and profitability.\nFrom time to time, the Company has been dependent on borrowings from the FHLB and the FRB, and there can be no assurance these programs will be available as needed.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company has borrowings from the FHLB of San Francisco of $307.1 million and no borrowings from the FRB. In the past, the Company has been reliant on such borrowings to satisfy its short-term liquidity needs. The Company\u2019s borrowing capacity is generally dependent on the value of the Company\u2019s collateral pledged to these entities. These lenders could reduce the borrowing capacity of the Company or eliminate certain types of collateral and could otherwise modify or even terminate its loan programs. Any change or termination could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity and profitability.\nThe business may be adversely affected by internet fraud.\nThe Company is inherently exposed to many types of operational risk, including those caused by the use of computer, internet and telecommunications systems. These risks may manifest themselves in the form of fraud by employees, by customers, other outside entities targeting us and/or our customers that use our internet banking, electronic banking or some other form of our telecommunications systems. Although we devote substantial resources to maintaining secure systems and to preventing such incidents, given the increasing sophistication of possible perpetrators, and the growing use of electronic, internet-based and networked systems to conduct business directly or indirectly with our clients, fraud losses may occur regardless of the preventative and detection systems in place or if those systems fail or prove to be inadequate.\nWe may experience interruptions or breaches in our information system security.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business, and have devoted substantial resources in recent years to improving the security of these systems. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of these information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of these information systems could damage our reputation, result in direct financial losses or a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.\nAs a financial institution, we are susceptible to theft and fraudulent activity that may be committed against us or our clients, which may result in financial losses to us or our clients, privacy breaches against our clients, or damage to our reputation. Such activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, and other dishonest acts. In recent periods, there has been a rise in electronic theft and fraudulent activity within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector, due to cyber criminals targeting commercial bank accounts. Consistent with industry trends, we have also experienced an increase in attempted electronic fraudulent activity in recent periods.\nIn addition, our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks. Although we take numerous protective measures to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our and our clients\u2019 information across all geographic and product lines, and endeavor to modify these protective measures as circumstances warrant, the nature of the threats continues to evolve. As a result, our computer systems, software and networks and those of our customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber attacks and other events that could have an adverse security impact and result in significant losses by us and/or our customers. Despite the defensive measures we take to manage our internal technological and operational infrastructure, these threats may originate externally from third parties, such as foreign governments, organized criminal groups and other hackers, and outsource or infrastructure-support providers and application developers, or the threats may originate from within our organization. Given the increasingly high volume of our transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they can be discovered and rectified.\nWe also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities, including vendors, exchanges, clearing agents, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source or cause of an attack on, or breach of, our operational systems, data or infrastructure. In addition, we may be at risk of an operational failure with respect to our clients\u2019 systems. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, the outsourcing of some of our business operations, and the continued uncertain global economic environment. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nWe maintain insurance policies that we believe provide reasonable coverage at a manageable expense for an institution of our size and scope with similar technological systems. However, we cannot assure that these policies will afford coverage for all possible losses or would be sufficient to cover all financial losses, damages, penalties, including lost revenues, should we experience any one or more of our or a third party\u2019s systems failing or experiencing an attack.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nWe have become increasingly dependent on third parties to provide key components for our business operations, such as data processing and storage, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. While we select these third-party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, cyber-attacks and security breaches at a vendor, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third-party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor's ability to serve us. Furthermore, our vendors could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. Replacing these third party vendors also could create significant delays and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations.\nA change in the Company\u2019s or Bank's credit worthiness could increase our cost of funding or adversely affect our liquidity.\nMarket participants regularly evaluate the creditworthiness of the Company and its long-term debt based on a number of factors, including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to changes in our perceived credit worthiness. Changes could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and our access to the capital markets, and could increase our cost of capital. Likewise, any loss of or decline in the credit rating assigned to WAB could impair its ability to attract deposits or to obtain other funding sources, or increase its cost of funding.\nThe Company\u2019s expansion strategy may not prove to be successful and our market value and profitability may suffer.\nThe Company continually evaluates expansion through acquisitions of banks and other financial businesses, the organization of new banks and the expansion of our existing banks through establishment of new branches. Any future acquisitions will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions. These risks include, among other things: 1) difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel; 2) potential disruption of our ongoing business; 3) failure to retain key personnel at the acquired business; and 4) inability of our management to maximize our financial and strategic position by the successful implementation of uniform product offerings and the incorporation of uniform technology into our product offerings and control systems.\nThe economic crisis in 2008 also highlighted risks that are unique to acquisitions of financial institutions and banks and that are difficult to assess, including the risk that the acquired institution has troubled, illiquid, or bad assets or an unstable base of deposits or assets under management. The Company expects that competition for suitable acquisition candidates may be significant. We may compete with other banks or financial service companies with similar acquisition strategies, many of which are larger and have greater financial and other resources. The Company cannot assure that we will be able to successfully identify and acquire suitable acquisition targets on acceptable terms and conditions.\nIn addition to the acquisition of existing financial institutions, the Company may consider the organization of new banks in new market areas, although we do not have any current plans to organize a new bank. Any acquisition of an existing business or the organization of a new bank carries with it numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe inability to obtain any required regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nsignificant costs and anticipated operating losses during the application and organizational phases, and the first years of operation of the new bank;\n\u2022\nthe inability to secure or retain the services of qualified senior management;\n\u2022\nthe local market may not accept the services of a bank owned and managed by a bank holding company headquartered outside of the market area of the bank;\n\u2022\nthe inability to obtain attractive locations within a new market at a reasonable cost; and\n\u2022\nthe additional strain on management resources and internal systems and controls.\nThe Company cannot provide any assurance that it will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions or the organization of new banks. Potential regulatory enforcement actions, like a MOU, also may adversely affect our ability to engage in certain expansionary activities. The Company\u2019s inability to provide\nresources necessary for its subsidiary banks to meet the requirements of any regulatory action or otherwise to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on the achievement of our business strategy and maintenance of our market value.\nThe Company\u2019s future success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in a highly competitive market.\nThe Company faces substantial competition in all phases of our operations from a variety of different competitors. Our competitors, including large commercial banks, community banks, thrift institutions, mutual savings banks, credit unions, finance companies, insurance companies, securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors, money market mutual funds and other financial institutions, compete with lending and deposit-gathering services offered by us. Increased competition in our markets may result in reduced loans and deposits or less favorable pricing.\nThere is competition for financial services in the markets in which we conduct our businesses, including from many local commercial banks as well as numerous national and regionally based commercial banks. In particular, we have experienced intense price and terms competition in some of the lending lines of business in recent years. Many of these competing institutions have much greater financial and marketing resources than we have. Due to their size, larger competitors can achieve economies of scale and may offer a broader range of products and services or more attractive pricing than us. If we are unable to offer competitive products and services, our business may be negatively affected.\nSome of the financial services organizations with which we compete are not subject to the same degree of regulation as is imposed on bank holding companies and federally insured depository institutions. As a result, these non-bank competitors have certain advantages over us in accessing funding and in providing various services. The banking business in our primary market areas is very competitive, and the level of competition facing us may increase further, which may limit our asset growth and financial results.\nThe success of the Company is dependent upon its ability to recruit and retain qualified employees, especially seasoned relationship bankers.\nThe Company\u2019s business plan includes and is dependent upon hiring and retaining highly qualified and motivated executives and employees at every level. In particular, our relative success to date has been partly the result of our management\u2019s ability to identify and retain highly qualified employees with expertise in certain specialty areas or that have long-standing relationships in their communities. These professionals bring with them valuable customer relationships and have been an integral part of our ability to attract deposits and to expand our market share. From time to time, the Company recruits or utilizes the services of employees who are subject to restrictions on their ability to use confidential information of a prior employer, to freely compete with that employer, or to solicit customers of that employer. If the Company is unable to hire or retain qualified employees, or if new employees are subject to these types of restrictions, it may not be able to successfully execute its business strategy. If the Company or its employee is found to have violated any non-solicitation or other restrictions applicable to it or its employee, the Company or its employee could become subject to litigation or other proceedings.\nThe Company could be harmed if it lost the services of key members of its senior management team or senior relationship bankers.\nWe believe that our success to date has been substantially dependent on our senior management team, including, but not limited to, Robert Sarver, Chairman and CEO; Dale Gibbons, CFO; Robert R. McAuslan, CCO; John Guedry, Executive Vice President-Southern Nevada Administration; James Lundy, Executive Vice President-Arizona Administration; and Gerald Cady, Executive Vice President-California Administration. We also believe that our prospects for success in the future are dependent on retaining our senior management team and senior relationship bankers. In addition to their skills and experience as bankers, these persons provide us with extensive community ties upon which our competitive strategy is based. Our ability to retain these persons may be hindered by the fact that we have not entered into employment agreements with any of them. The loss of the services of any of these persons, particularly Mr. Sarver, could have an adverse effect on our business if we cannot replace them with equally qualified persons who are also familiar with our market areas.\nMr. Sarver\u2019s involvement in outside business interests requires substantial time and attention and may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to achieve its strategic plan.\nMr. Sarver joined the Company in December 2002 and is an integral part of our business. He has substantial business interests that are unrelated to us, including his position as managing partner of the Phoenix Suns National Basketball Association franchise. Mr. Sarver\u2019s other business interests demand significant time commitments, the intensity of which may vary throughout the year. Mr. Sarver\u2019s other commitments may reduce the amount of time he has available to devote to our business. We believe that Mr. Sarver spends the substantial majority of his business time on matters related to our company. However, a significant reduction in the amount of time Mr. Sarver devotes to our business may adversely affect our ability to achieve our strategic plan.\nTerrorist attacks and threats of war or actual war may impact all aspects of our operations, revenues, costs and stock price in unpredictable ways.\nTerrorist attacks in the U.S., as well as future events occurring in response or in connection to them including, without limitation, future terrorist attacks against U.S. targets, rumors or threats of war, actual conflicts involving the U.S. or its allies or military or trade disruptions, may impact our operations. Any of these events could cause consumer confidence and savings to decrease or result in increased volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets and economy. Any of these occurrences could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s operating results, revenues and costs and may result in the volatility of the market price for our securities, including our common stock, and impair their future price.\nOur risk management practices may prove to be inadequate or not fully effective.\nOur risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return. We have established policies and procedures intended to identify, monitor and manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and reputational risk. In addition, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, we created a new BOD-level risk committee in April of 2014, which approves and reviews the Company's risk management policies and oversees operation of our risk management framework. Although we have devoted significant resources to developing our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future, these policies and procedures, as well as our risk management techniques, may not be fully effective. In addition, as regulations and markets in which we operate continue to evolve, our risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected. Management of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and/or forecasting models. If the models we use to mitigate these risks are inadequate, we may incur increased losses. In addition, there may be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated.\nThere are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with the introduction or expansion of lines of business or new products and services within existing lines of business.\nFrom time to time, we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible.\nRisks Related to the Banking Industry\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and accounting principles, or changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, may adversely affect us.\nThe Company is subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and legislation that govern almost all aspects of our operations. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Supervision and Regulation\u201d included in this Form 10-K. Intended to protect customers, depositors and the DIF, these laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on the business activities in which we can engage, limit the dividends or distributions that our banking subsidiary can pay to the Company or the Company can pay to its stockholders, restrict the ability of affiliates to guarantee the Company\u2019s debt, impose certain specific accounting requirements on us that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than GAAP, among other things. Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose significant additional compliance costs. Further, an alleged failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations, even if we acted in good faith or the alleged failure reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject the Company to additional restrictions on its business activities (including mergers, acquisitions and new branches), fines and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, capital base and the price of our securities.\nOn July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, into law. The Dodd-Frank Act has had, and will continue to have, a broad impact on the financial services industry, including significant regulatory and compliance changes. Many of the requirements called for in the Dodd-Frank Act have been implemented through regulations issued by the SEC and Federal banking agencies, such as the FDIC and Federal Reserve, and the Company has had to take, and will need to continue to take, various actions, including the creation and implementation of compliance policies and procedures and other internal controls, by these rules' various compliance deadlines. Given the relatively recent vintage of our design and implementation of the compliance systems required to meet the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations, the full extent of the impact of conducting business under this new\ncompliance regime on our operations is unclear. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. In particular, the potential impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our operations and activities, both currently and prospectively, may include, among others:\n\u2022\na reduction in our ability to generate or originate revenue-producing assets as a result of compliance with heightened capital standards;\n\u2022\nan increased cost of operations due to greater regulatory oversight, supervision and examination of banks and bank holding companies, and higher deposit insurance premiums;\n\u2022\nthe limitation on our ability to raise qualifying regulatory capital through the use of trust preferred securities as these securities may no longer be included in Tier 1 capital going forward; and\n\u2022\nthe limitations on our ability to offer certain consumer products and services due to anticipated stricter consumer protection laws and regulations.\nExamples of these provisions include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ncreation of the Financial Stability Oversight Council that may recommend to the Federal Reserve increasingly strict rules for capital, leverage, liquidity, risk management and other requirements as companies grow in size and complexity;\n\u2022\napplication of the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies, such as the Company;\n\u2022\nchanges to the assessment base used by the FDIC to assess insurance premiums from insured depository institutions and increases to the minimum reserve ratio for the DIF, from 1.15% to not less than 1.35%, with provisions to require institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more to bear a greater portion of the costs associated with increasing the DIF\u2019s reserve ratio;\n\u2022\nrepeal of the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts;\n\u2022\nestablishment of the CFPB with broad authority to implement new consumer protection regulations and, for banks and bank holding companies with $10 billion or more in assets, to examine and enforce compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws;\n\u2022\nimplementation of risk retention rules for loans (excluding qualified residential mortgages) that are sold by a bank; and\n\u2022\namendment of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to, among other things, give the Federal Reserve the authority to issue rules that limit debit-card interchange fees.\nWhile we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on us, these changes could be materially adverse to our investors.\nDuring 2014, WAB and the Company each increased their respective total consolidated assets above $10 billion, and both will be subject to new regulations and oversight not applicable in the past.\nDuring the second quarter of 2014, WAB and the Company increased total consolidated assets to over $10 billion. The CFPB is tasked with establishing and implementing rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has rulemaking authority over many of the statutes governing products and services offered to bank consumers. Importantly, for banking organizations with assets of $10 billion or more like WAB and the Company, the CFPB has exclusive rulemaking and examination authority, and primary enforcement authority for most federal consumer financial services laws. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the CFPB. Compliance with any such new regulations would increase our cost of operations, and the Company will be subject to new examinations conducted by the CFPB. Failure to comply with these new requirements or receiving adverse examination findings from the CFPB, among other things, may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nOther Dodd-Frank Act requirements will also be applicable to WAB and the Company. For example, the Company must conduct annual stress tests using various scenarios established by the Federal Reserve, including a baseline, adverse and severely adverse economic conditions. The stress test is designed to determine whether our capital planning, assessment of\ncapital adequacy and risk management practices adequately protect the Company and its affiliates in the event of an economic downturn. The Company must establish adequate internal controls, documentation, policies and procedures to ensure the annual stress adequately meets these objectives. The BOD must review our policies and procedures at least annually. We will be required to report the results of our annual stress to the Federal Reserve and we must consider the results of our stress test as part of our capital planning and risk management practices.\nWith respect to deposit-taking activities, banks with assets in excess of $10 billion are subject to two changes. First, these institutions are subject to a deposit assessment based on a new scorecard issued by the FDIC. This scorecard considers, among other things, the Bank\u2019s CAMELS rating, results of asset-related stress testing and funding-related stress, as well our use of core deposits, among other things. Depending on the results of the bank\u2019s performance under that scorecard, the total base assessment rate is between 2.5 to 45 basis points. Additionally, banks with over $10 billion in total assets are no longer exempt from the requirements of the Federal Reserve\u2019s rules on interchange transaction fees for debit cards. This means that, beginning on July 1, 2015, WAB will be limited to receiving only a \"reasonable\" interchange transaction fee for any debit card transactions processed using debit cards issued by the bank to its customers. The Federal Reserve has determined that it is unreasonable for a bank with more than $10 billion in total assets to receive more than $0.21 plus 5 basis points of the transaction plus a $0.01 fraud adjustment for an interchange transaction fee for debit card transactions.\nThe Company may expend additional resources necessary to comply with these new regulatory requirements. Increased deposit insurance assessments may result in an increased expense related to our use of deposits as a funding source. Likewise, a reduction in the amount of interchange fees we receive for electronic debit interchange will reduce our revenues. In 2014, the Company earned $2.0 million in debit card interchange fees. Finally, failure to meet the enhanced prudential standards and stress testing requirements could limit, among other things, our ability to engage in expansionary activities or make dividend payments to our shareholders.\nState and federal banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including for compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which we are or become subject as a result of such examinations may adversely affect us.\nState and federal banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including for compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, an agency were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that any of our banks or their management was in violation of any law or regulation, federal banking agencies may take a number of different remedial or enforcement actions it deems appropriate to remedy such a deficiency. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in the bank\u2019s capital, to restrict the bank\u2019s growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against the bank\u2019s officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if the FDIC concludes that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate the bank\u2019s deposit insurance. Under Arizona law, the state banking supervisory authority has many of the same enforcement powers with respect to its state-chartered banks. Finally, the CFPB has the authority to examine and supervise us and has authority to take enforcement actions, including the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or civil monetary penalties against us if it finds that we offer consumer financial products and services in violation of federal consumer financial protection laws or in an unfair, deceptive or abusive manner.\nIf we were unable to comply with regulatory directives in the future, or if we were unable to comply with the terms of any future supervisory requirements to which we may become subject, then we could become subject to a variety of supervisory actions and orders, including cease and desist orders, prompt corrective actions, MOUs, and/or other regulatory enforcement actions. If our regulators were to take such supervisory actions, then we could, among other things, become subject to greater restrictions on our ability to develop any new business, as well as restrictions on our existing business, and we could be required to raise additional capital, dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time, or both. Failure to implement the measures in the time frames provided, or at all, could result in additional orders or penalties from federal and state regulators, which could result in one or more of the remedial actions described above. In the event WAB was ultimately unable to comply with the terms of a regulatory enforcement action, it could ultimately fail and be placed into receivership by the chartering agency. The terms of any such supervisory action and the consequences associated with any failure to comply therewith could have a material negative effect on our business, operating flexibility and financial condition.\nChanges in interest rates and increased rate competition could adversely affect our profitability, business and prospects.\nMost of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature, which subjects us to significant risks from changes in interest rates and can impact our net income and the valuation of our assets and liabilities. Increases or decreases in prevailing interest rates could have an adverse effect on our business, asset quality and prospects. The Company\u2019s operating income and net income depend to a great extent on our net interest margin. Net interest margin is the difference between the interest yields we receive on loans, securities and other earning assets and the interest rates we pay on interest bearing deposits, borrowings and other liabilities. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including competition, general economic conditions and monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve. If the rate of interest we pay on our interest bearing deposits, borrowings and other liabilities increases more than the rate of interest we receive on loans, securities and other earning assets increases, our net interest income, and therefore our earnings, would be adversely affected. The Company\u2019s earnings also could be adversely affected if the rates on our loans and other investments fall more quickly than those on our deposits and other liabilities. We have recently experienced increased competition for loans on the basis of interest rates.\nIn addition, loan volumes are affected by market interest rates on loans. Rising interest rates generally are associated with a lower volume of loan originations, while lower interest rates are usually associated with higher loan originations. Conversely, in rising interest rate environments, loan repayment rates will decline and in falling interest rate environments, loan repayment rates will increase. The Company cannot guarantee that it will be able to minimize interest rate risk. In addition, an increase in the general level of interest rates may adversely affect the ability of certain borrowers to pay the interest on and principal of their obligations.\nInterest rates also affect how much money the Company can lend. When interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing increases. Accordingly, changes in market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest spread, asset quality, loan origination volume, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company is exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we obtain title.\nApproximately 63% of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio at December 31, 2014 was secured by real estate. In the course of our business, the Company may foreclose and take title to real estate, and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. These costs and claims could be substantial and adversely affect our business and prospects.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock has increased substantially in the past several years and may fluctuate significantly in the future, which may make it difficult for you to resell shares of common stock owned by you at times or at prices you find attractive.\nThe price of our common stock on New York Stock Exchange constantly changes, and has increased substantially the past three years. We expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate and there can be no assurances about the market prices for our common stock.\nOur stock price may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nsales of our equity securities;\n\u2022\nour financial condition, performance, creditworthiness and prospects;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our operating results or the quality of our assets;\n\u2022\noperating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance;\n\u2022\nannouncements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors believe are comparable to us;\n\u2022\nthe credit, mortgage and housing markets, the markets for securities relating to mortgages or housing, and developments with respect to financial institutions generally;\n\u2022\nchanges in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity or real estate valuations or volatility and other geopolitical, regulatory or judicial events; and\n\u2022\nour past and future dividend practices.\nThere may be future sales or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional common stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock. We also grant a significant number of shares of common stock to employees and directors under our Incentive Plan each year. The issuance of any additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock or securities convertible into, exchangeable for or that represent the right to receive common stock or the exercise of such securities could be substantially dilutive to stockholders of our common stock. Holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle such holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their stock holdings in us.\nOfferings of debt, which would be senior to our common stock upon liquidation, and/or preferred equity securities which may be senior to our common stock for purposes of dividend distributions or upon liquidation, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe may from time to time issue debt securities, borrow money through other means, or issue preferred stock. On August 25, 2010, the Company completed a public offering of $75 million in principal Senior Notes due in 2015. In 2011, we issued preferred stock to the federal government under the SBLF program, and from time to time we have borrowed money from the FRB, the FHLB, other financial institutions and other lenders. All of these securities or borrowings have priority over the common stock in a liquidation, which could affect the market price of our stock. The SBLF preferred stock also may restrict our ability to pay dividends on our common stock under certain circumstances.\nOur BOD is authorized to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock from time to time without any action on the part of the stockholders. Our BOD also has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, and preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or upon our dissolution, winding-up and liquidation and other terms. If we issue preferred stock in the future that has a preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nAnti-takeover provisions could negatively impact our stockholders.\nProvisions of Delaware law and provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws, as amended, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of us. Additionally, our Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, authorizes our BOD to issue additional series of preferred stock and such preferred stock could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal. These provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 90776, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "WAL"}
