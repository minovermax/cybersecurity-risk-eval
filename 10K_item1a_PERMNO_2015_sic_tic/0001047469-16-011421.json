RISK FACTORS\nIn evaluating our company, careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors, in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and/or financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. In addition to the following disclosures, please refer to the other information contained in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes.\nThe economic conditions in the United States and around the world could adversely affect our financial results.\nDemand for our products and services depends upon worldwide economic conditions, including but not limited to overall economic growth rates, construction, consumer spending, financing availability, employment rates, interest rates, inflation, consumer confidence, defense spending levels, and the profits, capital spending, and liquidity of industrial companies.\nWe operate in the highly competitive EMS industry.\nWe compete against many EMS companies. The larger global competitors have more resources and greater economies of scale. We also compete with OEM in-house operations that are continually evaluating manufacturing products internally against the advantages of outsourcing. We may also be at a competitive disadvantage with respect to price when compared to manufacturers with excess capacity, lower cost structures and availability of lower cost labor.\nCompetitive factors in our targeted markets are believed to be quality, the ability to meet delivery schedules, customer service, technology solutions, and price. We also expect that our competitors will continue to improve the performance of their current products or services, to reduce their current products or service sales prices and improve services that maybe offered. Any of these could cause a decline in sales, loss of market share, or lower profit margin.\nThe availability of excess manufacturing capacity of our competitors also creates competitive pressure on price and winning new business. We must continue to provide a quality product, be responsive and flexible to customers' requirements, and deliver to customers' expectations. Our lack of execution could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAs a medical device manufacturer we have additional compliance requirements. We are required to register with the FDA and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA's QSR requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections and product field monitoring by the FDA. If any FDA inspection reveals noncompliance with QSR or other FDA regulations, it could adversely affect our operations.\nA large percentage of our sales have been made to a small number of customers, and the loss of a major customer, if not replaced, would adversely affect us.\nOur largest customer has two divisions that account for 27% and 29% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nWe are dependent on suppliers for electronic components and may experience shortages, extended lead times, cost premiums and shipment delays that would adversely affect our customers and us.\nWe purchase raw materials, commodities and components for use in our production. Increased costs of these materials could have an adverse effect on our production costs if we are unable to pass along price increases or reduce the other cost of goods produced through cost improvement initiatives. Fuel and energy cost increases could also adversely affect our freight and operating costs. Due to customer specifications and requirements, we are dependent on suppliers to provide critical electronic components and materials for our operations that could result in shortages of some of the electronic components needed for their production. Component shortages may result in expedited freight, overtime premiums and increased component costs. In addition to the financial impact on operations from lost revenue and increased cost, there could potentially be harm to our customer relationships.\nOur customers cancel orders, change order quantity, timing and specifications that if not managed would have an adverse affect on inventory carrying costs.\nWe face, through the normal course of business, customer cancellations and rescheduled orders and are not always successful in recovering the costs of such cancellations or rescheduling. In addition, excess and obsolete inventory losses as a result of customer order changes, cancellations, product changes and contract termination could have an adverse effect on our operations. We estimate and reserve for any known or potential impact from these possibilities.\nSome shareholders may be able to take actions that do not reflect the will or best interests of other shareholders.\nOur officers and directors control a majority share of our outstanding common stock and could individually or together exert a significant degree of influence over our affairs.\nThe manufacture and sale of our products carries potential risk for product liability claims.\nWe represent and warrant the goods and services we deliver are free from defects in material and workmanship for one year from ship date. We make no other guarantees or warranties, expressed or implied, of any nature whatsoever as to the goods including without limitation, warranties to merchantability, fit for a particular purpose, non-infringement of patent or the like unless agreed upon in writing. If a product liability claim results in our being liable and the amount is in excess of our insurance coverage or there is no insurance coverage for the claim then it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial position.\nWe depend heavily on our people and may from time to time have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled employees.\nOur operations depend upon the continued contributions of our key management, marketing, technical, financial, accounting, product development engineers, sales people and operational personnel. We also believe that our continued success will depend upon our ability to attract, retain and develop highly skilled managerial and technical resources within the highly competitive EMS industry. Not being able to attract or retain these employees could have a material adverse effect on revenues and earnings.\nOperating in foreign countries exposes our operations to risks that could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe operate a manufacturing facility in Mexico. Our operation there is subject to risks that could adversely impact our financial results, such as economic or political volatility, crime, severe weather, employee turnover, staffing, managing personnel in diverse culture, labor instability, transportation delays, and foreign currency fluctuations. Our manufacturing facility in China will begin operations in the first half of 2016.\nNon-compliance with environmental laws may result in restrictions and could adversely affect operations.\nOur operations are regulated under a number of federal, state, and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations that govern the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water, as well as the handling, storage, and disposal of such materials. These laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; as well as analogous state and foreign laws. Compliance with these environmental laws is a major consideration for us due to our manufacturing processes and materials. It is possible we may be subject to potential financial liability for costs associated with the investigation and remediation at our sites; this may have an adverse effect on operations. We have not incurred significant costs related to compliance with environmental laws and regulations and we believe that our operations comply with all applicable environmental laws.\nEnvironmental laws could also become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violation. We operate in environmentally sensitive locations and are subject to potentially conflicting and changing regulatory agendas of political, business, and environmental groups. Changes or restrictions on discharge limits; emissions levels; or material storage, handling, or disposal might require a high level of unplanned capital investment or relocation. It is possible that environmental compliance costs and penalties from new or existing regulations may harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to risks associated with our acquisitions, and the risks could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur strategy is to grow our business organically and through acquisitions, alliances and joint venture arrangements. We will continue to pursue and acquire additional businesses in the EMS industry that fit our long-term objectives for growth and profitability. The success of our acquisitions will depend on our ability to integrate the new operations with the existing operations. The price we pay for a business may exceed the value we realize and we cannot assure you that we will achieve the expected synergies and benefits of any acquisition. Acquisitions may result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets which are subject to potential impairments in the future that could harm our financial results.\nIf we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our credit agreement we may be unable to secure additional financing and repayment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness may be accelerated.\nOur credit agreement contains financial and operating covenants with which we must comply. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with these covenants. However, our continued compliance with these covenants is dependent on our financial results, which are subject to fluctuation as described elsewhere in these risk factors. If we fail to comply with the covenants in the future or if our lender does not agree to waive any future non-compliance, we may be unable to borrow funds and any outstanding indebtedness could become immediately due and payable, which could materially harm our business.\nWe are dependent on our management information systems for order, inventory and production management, financial reporting, communications and other functions. If our information systems fail or experience major interruptions, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, our business and our financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on our management information systems to effectively manage our operational and financial functions. Our computer systems, Internet web sites, telecommunications, and data networks are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, natural disasters and attacks from viruses or hackers, including cybersecurity threats and incidents. Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems to targeted measures directed at the Company, its customers, its designs and/or its products. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to attempt to mitigate our exposure to these risks, attacks are evolving and unpredictable and we cannot guarantee that any risk prevention measures implemented will be successful. System failures or interruptions, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur business may be impacted by natural disasters or future climate change.\nNatural disasters, such as tornadoes and earthquakes, and possible future changes in climate could negatively impact our business and supply chain. Our properties may be exposed to rare catastrophic weather events, such as severe storms and/or floods. If the frequency of extreme weather events increases due to climate change, our exposure to these events could increase. In countries that we rely on for operations and materials, such as Mexico, China and Thailand, potential natural disasters or future climate changes could disrupt our manufacturing operations, reduce demand for our customers' products and increase supply chain costs.", "PERMNO": 79322, "SIC": 3679, "TIC": "NSYS"}
