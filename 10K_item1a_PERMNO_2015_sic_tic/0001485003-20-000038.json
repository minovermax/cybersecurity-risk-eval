{"cik": "1485003", "company": "Sesen Bio, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe are a specialty pharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. Over the past few years, we have focused primarily on developing our lead product candidate, Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC. Since our inception, we have received no revenues from sales of our products, have incurred significant operating losses and expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue our ongoing Phase 3 VISTA Trial of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC and seek marketing approval from the FDA. We had a net losses of $107.5 million, $33.7 million and $29.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We incurred negative cash flows from operating activities of $37.5 million, $22.8 million and $17.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $48.1 million, net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) of $45.9 million and an accumulated deficit of $293.5 million. We have financed our operations to date primarily through private placements of our common stock, preferred stock, common stock warrants and convertible bridge notes, venture debt borrowings, our initial public offering (\"IPO\"), our follow-on public offerings, sales effected in \"at-the-market\" (\"ATM\") offerings, our License Agreement with Roche and, to a lesser extent, from a collaboration. The majority of our revenue to date has been from milestone payments received under our License Agreement with Roche and collaboration revenue. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.\nWe expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect these losses to increase as we:\n\u2022\nseek marketing approval for Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC in the United States, including a meeting with the FDA's ODAC;\n\u2022\nestablish a commercialization infrastructure and scale up external manufacturing and distribution capabilities to commercialize Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, if approved;\n\u2022\nadapt our regulatory compliance efforts to incorporate requirements applicable to marketed drugs;\n\u2022\ncontinue our clinical development activities for Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, including a post-marketing confirmatory trial;\n\u2022\nseek and conduct combination trials of one or more of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nseek to discover and develop additional product candidates;\n\u2022\nin-license or acquire the rights to other products, product candidates or technologies;\n\u2022\nseek marketing approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n\u2022\nmaintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022\nadd equipment and physical infrastructure to support our research and development;\n\u2022\ncomplete the technology transfer of Vicinium bulk drug substance manufacturing to Fujifilm;\n\u2022\nhire additional clinical, quality control, scientific and management personnel, including personnel to support our commercialization efforts; and\n\u2022\nexpand our operational, financial and management systems and personnel.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with drug development and commercialization, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. If we are required by regulatory authorities to perform studies in addition to those expected or if there are any delays in the initiation and completion of our clinical trials or the development of any of our product candidates, our expenses could increase.\nWith the exception of specified regulatory, development and commercial milestones under our License Agreement with Roche, we currently have no source of product revenue and may never become profitable.\nOur ability to become and remain profitable depends on our ability to generate revenue. Although we may be entitled to certain licensing fees related to specific regulatory, development and commercial milestones for EBI-031 under our License Agreement with Roche, we have not commercialized any of our product candidates. We do not expect to generate significant revenue from the development of our product candidates unless and until we obtain marketing approval for, and commercialize, Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC. Our ability to generate revenue from Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, if approved, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain regulatory approval for, and successfully commercialize, Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC;\n\u2022\nour ability to complete and submit our BLA for Vicinium to the FDA and obtain regulatory approval for indications for which there is a commercial market;\n\u2022\nour ability to complete and submit applications to, and obtaining regulatory approval from, foreign regulatory authorities, including Health Canada and the European Commission;\n\u2022\nthe size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nour ability to find a suitable contract sales organization (\"CSO\") to help us market and promote Vicinium, if approved;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop a commercial organization capable of sales, marketing and distribution for Vicinium, if approved;\n\u2022\nour ability to enter into and maintain commercially reasonable agreements with wholesalers, distributors and other third parties in our supply chain;\n\u2022\nour success in establishing a commercially viable price for Vicinium, if approved;\n\u2022\nour success in defending against potential competition and other developments in our market generally;\n\u2022\nour ability to manufacture commercial quantities of Vicinium at acceptable cost levels;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including government payors; and\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully complete development activities, including the necessary clinical trials, for Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC.\nEven if Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC is approved for commercial sale, Vicinium may not gain market acceptance or achieve commercial success. If our addressable market is not as significant as we estimate, the indication approved by regulatory authorities is narrower than we expect or the treatment population is narrowed by competition, physician choice or clinical practice guidelines, we may not generate significant revenue from sales of Vicinium. In addition, we would anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing Vicinium, if approved. We may not achieve profitability soon after generating product sales from Vicinium, if ever. If we are unable to generate product revenues from Vicinium, we will not become profitable and may be unable to continue operations without continued funding.\nEven if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our development efforts, obtain drug approvals, diversify our offerings or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nWe will need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe are devoting substantial financial resources to our ongoing and planned activities including functions associated with operating as a public company. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to commercialize Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, if approved. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe success of our commercialization of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, if approved;\n\u2022\nthe outcome, timing and cost of the regulatory approval process for Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC by the FDA, including the potential for the FDA to require that we perform more studies and clinical trials than those we currently expect;\n\u2022\nthe costs and timing of the implementation of commercial-scale manufacturing activities;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish commercial arrangements on favorable terms, if at all, particularly manufacturing, marketing and distribution arrangements for Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC;\n\u2022\nthe costs and timing associated with our manufacturing process and technology transfer to Fujifilm;\n\u2022\nthe costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022\nour obligation to make milestone, royalty and other payments to third party licensors under our licensing agreements;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we in-license or acquire rights to other products, product candidates or technologies;\n\u2022\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments; and\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we in-license or acquire other products, product candidates or technologies.\nWe cannot be certain that additional funding will be available when needed on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts, when required or on acceptable terms, we also could be required to:\n\u2022\nseek strategic collaborations to assist in the commercialization of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC in the United States and other markets;\n\u2022\nrelinquish or license on unfavorable terms our rights to Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC or our other product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop and commercialize ourselves;\n\u2022\ndelay, limit, reduce or terminate the drug development of our product candidates, or seek collaborators for one or more of our product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available; or\n\u2022\nsignificantly curtail our operations.\nBased on our current operating plan, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents of $48.1 million as of December 31, 2019 will be sufficient to fund our operations into 2021; however, we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and our capital resources may be utilized faster than we currently expect.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph relating to our ability to continue as a going concern in its report on our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur report from our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes an explanatory paragraph stating that our recurring losses from operations and insufficient cash resources raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or engage in another strategic transaction on acceptable terms and when needed, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected and we may be unable to continue as a going concern. While we believe that our cash and cash equivalents of $48.1 million at December 31, 2019 will be sufficient to fund our operations into 2021, given our planned expenditures for the next several years, we and our independent registered public accounting firm have concluded that there is still a substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our audited financial statements, and it is likely that investors will lose all or a part of their investment. If we seek additional financing to fund our business activities in the future and there remains substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, investors or other financing sources may be unwilling to provide additional funding to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nFuture sales and issuances of shares of our common stock or rights to purchase shares of our common stock, including common stock purchase warrants and stock options, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, government or other third-party funding, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, other commercial arrangements and marketing and distribution arrangements. We do not have any committed external source of funds other than the amounts payable under the License Agreement with Roche. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders\u2019 ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders\u2019 rights as holders of our common stock. For example, as of December 31, 2019, and subject to adjustment upon certain corporate events, including stock dividends, stock splits and distributions of cash, up to 22,894,704 shares of our common stock could be issuable by us, with a weighted-average exercise price of $1.43 per share, in connection with the exercise of our outstanding warrants to purchase our common stock.\nWe have also adopted the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (\"2014 Plan\") to enable us and our subsidiaries to recruit and retain highly qualified employees, directors and consultants, provide those individuals with an incentive for productivity, and provide those individuals with an opportunity to share in our growth and value. As of December 31, 2019, we had an aggregate of 6,236,384 stock options outstanding under the 2014 Plan, our prior equity plan and inducement awards granted outside of our equity plans. In addition, as of December 31, 2019, we had 8,753,022 shares of common stock available for grant under our 2014 Plan. Future equity incentive grants and issuances of shares of common stock under the 2014 Plan, or other grants outside of the 2014 Plan pursuant to inducement equity awards, may have an adverse effect on the market price of shares of our common stock.\nFurther, debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise additional funds through government or other third-party funding, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyberattacks or a deficiency in our cybersecurity or those of any business partner.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures, cyberattacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, loss of funds or information from phishing or other fraudulent schemes, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization. The risks of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyberattacks or cyber-intrusions, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyberterrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Such an event could cause interruption of our operations or loss of Company funds and have a negative financial consequence on our business. For example, the loss of data from completed or ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential, proprietary or personal information, we could incur material legal claims and liability and damage to our reputation and the development and commercialization of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC could be delayed.\nPublic health epidemics or outbreaks, including the recent COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, could adversely affect our business.\nBroad-based business or economic disruptions could adversely affect our ongoing or planned development and operational activities, as well as our ability to raise capital. For example, in December 2019 an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, China. This virus continues to spread globally, has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and has spread to over 100 countries, including the United States. The impact of this pandemic has been and will likely continue to be extensive in many aspects of society, which has resulted in and will likely continue to result in significant disruptions to businesses and capital markets around the world.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the pandemic, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and public and private actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact. COVID-19 has and will likely continue to result in social, economic, and labor instability in the countries in which we or the third parties with whom we engage operate. While we cannot presently predict the scope and severity of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions, if we or any of the third parties with whom we engage, including the suppliers, manufacturers and other third parties in our global supply chain, clinical trial sites, regulators, potential business development partners and other third parties with whom we conduct business, were to experience shutdowns or other business disruptions, our ability to conduct our business in the manner and on the timelines presently planned could be materially and negatively impacted.\nRisks Related to Clinical Development and Regulatory Approval of Vicinium\nWe are dependent on our lead product candidate, Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC. If we are unable to obtain marketing approval for or successfully commercialize our lead product candidate, either alone or through a collaboration, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business could be materially harmed.\nWe currently have no products approved for sale and have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC. Our prospects are substantially dependent on our ability to obtain marketing approval for and successfully commercialize Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC. The success of Vicinium will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nreceipt of marketing approvals from the FDA, Health Canada, the European Commission or comparable foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ndeveloping and maintaining the commercial manufacturing supply and distribution chain for Vicinium;\n\u2022\nperformance of our future collaborators, if any;\n\u2022\nextent of any required post-marketing approval commitments to applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nobtaining and maintaining patent, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally;\n\u2022\nprotection of our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022\nlaunch of commercial sales, if and when marketing approval is received;\n\u2022\ndemonstration of an acceptable safety profile prior to and following any marketing approval;\n\u2022\nmarketplace acceptance, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\u2022\nestablishing and maintaining pricing sufficient to realize a meaningful return on our investment; and\n\u2022\ncompetition with other therapies.\nIf we are unable to develop, receive marketing approval for, or successfully commercialize Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC or experience delays as a result of any of these factors or otherwise, our business could be materially harmed.\nIf clinical trials of Vicinium fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, Health Canada, the EMA or other regulatory authorities or do not otherwise produce favorable results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be delayed or unable to complete, the development and commercialization of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC.\nBefore obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, we must complete pre-clinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of Vicinium in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and preliminary results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Moreover, pre-clinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their product candidates.\nMany compounds that initially showed promise in early-stage testing for treating cancer have later been found to not be effective treatments or to cause side effects that prevented further development of the compound. The therapeutic efficacy and safety profile of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC has not been demonstrated in humans, and we may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize Vicinium.\nVicinium is novel and its potential benefit is unproven. Our ability to generate revenues from Vicinium, which we do not expect will occur in the short term, if ever, will depend heavily on the successful development, approval and commercialization, if achieved, of Vicinium. For example, Vicinium may not prove to be an effective treatment for the cancer target it is designed to act against and may not demonstrate in patients any or all of the pharmacological data points that may have been demonstrated in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. Vicinium may interact with human biological systems in unforeseen, ineffective or harmful ways. If Vicinium is associated with undesirable side effects or has characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon its development or limit development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Many compounds that initially showed promise in early-stage testing for treating cancer have later been found to not be effective treatments or to cause side effects that prevented further development of the compound. As a result of these and other risks described herein that are inherent in the development of novel therapeutic agents, we may never successfully develop, enter into or maintain third party licensing or collaboration transactions with respect to, or successfully commercialize Vicinium, in which case we will not achieve profitability and the value of our shares of common stock may decline.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue development of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that have a greater likelihood of clinical success or commercial potential.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on research programs and product candidates that we identify for specific indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater likelihood of clinical success or commercial potential. For example, we previously invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of isunakinra for the treatment of patients with dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis. Notwithstanding this significant investment, based on the results from our completed Phase 3 clinical trials in dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis, we do not plan to pursue further development of isunakinra. Additionally, in September 2017, we deferred further development of Vicinium for the treatment of SCCHN and VB6-845d in order to focus our efforts and our resources on our ongoing development of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC.\nOur resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. In addition, if we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.\nIf we experience any of a number of possible unforeseen events in connection with our clinical trials, potential marketing approval or commercialization of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC that we may develop, including:\n\u2022\nclinical trials of Vicinium may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon the development of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC;\n\u2022\nthe number of patients required for clinical trials of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower or more challenging than we anticipate or patients may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nour third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements, including cGCP or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022\ninspection of the clinical trial operations, trial sites or manufacturing facilities by the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities such as Health Canada, or the competent authorities of the E.U. Member States, could result in findings of non-compliance and the imposition of a clinical suspension or termination;\n\u2022\nregulators or IRBs/Ethics Committees may delay or not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022\nwe may experience delays or fail to reach agreement with the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority, including Health Canada or the competent authorities of the E.U. Member States, on a trial design that we are able to execute;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to identify and maintain a sufficient number of trial sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical trial programs, including for the same indications as our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwe may experience delays in reaching, or fail to reach, agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites;\n\u2022\ntrial sites and investigators may deviate from clinical trial protocols or otherwise fail to conduct the trial in accordance with regulatory requirements, and investigators may drop out of the clinical trial;\n\u2022\ntrial sites may withdraw from our clinical trials, including as a result of changing standards of care or ineligibility of a site to participate in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwe may decide, or regulators or IRBs/Ethics Committees or other reviewing entities, including comparable foreign regulatory authorities such as Health Canada or the competent authorities of the E.U. Member States, may require us to suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements including cGCP or a finding that the patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\nthe cost of clinical trials of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nwe may receive feedback from DSMBs or the FDA, or a comparable foreign regulatory authority, including Health Canada or the competent authorities of the E.U. Member States, that might require modification to the protocol for the clinical trial or performance of additional studies before clinical trials may continue;\n\u2022\nas a clinical trial proceeds, or as the results of earlier stage studies or concurrent studies become available, we may determine that we need to modify the protocol and/or other aspects of the clinical trial before it may continue;\n\u2022\nthe FDA, a comparable foreign regulatory authority, including Health Canada, or the competent authorities of the E.U. Member States, or we may decide to, or a DSMB may recommend to, suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for safety issues or for any other reason;\n\u2022\nthe supply or quality of Vicinium or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of Vicinium may be insufficient or inadequate;\n\u2022\nVicinium may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators, regulators or IRBs/Ethics Committees to suspend or terminate the trials;\n\u2022\nlack of adequate funding to continue a clinical trial, including the incurrence of unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional clinical trials or increased expenses associated with the services of our CROs and other third parties; and\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable laws, governmental regulations or administrative actions.\nWe rely on CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials, and while we have agreements governing their activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance. Any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our development and regulatory submission process for Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC and jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approval, commence commercial sales and generate revenues, if Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC is ultimately approved.\nFurther, conducting clinical trials in foreign countries, as we have done historically for Vicinium (both for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC and for the treatment of SCCHN) and as we may decide to do in the future, presents additional risks that may delay completion of our clinical trials. These risks include the failure of enrolled patients in foreign countries to adhere to clinical protocol as a result of differences in healthcare services or cultural customs, managing additional administrative burdens associated with foreign regulatory frameworks, as well as political and economic risks relevant to such foreign countries.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of Vicinium or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not favorable or are only modestly favorable or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u2022\nbe delayed in obtaining marketing approval for Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC;\n\u2022\nnot obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u2022\nobtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u2022\nobtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings, or is subject to a REMS;\n\u2022\nbe subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or\n\u2022\nhave Vicinium removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nOur product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or marketing approvals. We do not know whether any of our pre-clinical studies or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant pre-clinical or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully commercialize Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, including Health Canada or the EMA. We have previously experienced difficulties with clinical trial enrollment and retention, which led to the early termination of our Phase 3 trial of Vicinium for the treatment of SCCHN in 2008, and we may experience difficulties in patient enrollment in our clinical trials in the future for a variety of reasons.\nSubject enrollment is affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022\nthe eligibility criteria for the clinical trial in question;\n\u2022\nthe size of the patient population for the disease;\n\u2022\nthe size of the patient population required for statistically significant analysis of the clinical trial\u2019s primary endpoints;\n\u2022\nthe design of the clinical trial;\n\u2022\nthe clinicians' and patients' perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study, including relative to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe patient referral practices of physicians;\n\u2022\nany ongoing clinical trials conducted by competitors for the same indication;\n\u2022\nthe risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the clinical trials before completion;\n\u2022\nthe ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and\n\u2022\nthe proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nFurther, our ability to successfully initiate, enroll and complete a clinical trial in any foreign country, should we decide to do so, is subject to numerous risks unique to conducting business in foreign countries, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulty in establishing or managing relationships with CROs and physicians;\n\u2022\ndifferent or additional standards for the conduct of clinical trials;\n\u2022\nabsence in some countries of established groups with sufficient regulatory expertise for review of the protocols associated with our product candidates;\n\u2022\nensuring that clinical trial quality is sufficient to meet the standards of the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nour inability to locate qualified local consultants, physicians and partners; and\n\u2022\nthe potential burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws, medical standards and regulatory requirements, including the regulation of pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and treatments.\nIn addition, our clinical trials will compete with other clinical trials for other product candidates that are in the same therapeutic areas as our product candidates, and this competition will reduce the number and types of patients available to us, because some patients who might have opted to enroll in our trials may instead opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by one of our competitors. Since the number of qualified clinical investigators is limited, we expect to conduct some of our clinical trials at the same clinical trial sites that some of our competitors use, which will reduce the number of patients who are available for our clinical trials in such clinical trial site. Moreover, because our product candidates represent a departure from more commonly used methods for cancer treatment, potential patients and their doctors may be inclined to use conventional therapies, such as chemotherapy, rather than enroll patients in any of our clinical trials.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials would result in significant delays, could require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether and could delay or prevent our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals. Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which would cause the value of our company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing.\nVicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC may cause undesirable side effects, serious adverse events or have other properties that could delay or halt clinical trials, delay or prevent its regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of its labeling, if approved, or result in significant negative consequences following any marketing approval.\nUndesirable side effects or serious adverse events caused by Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt respective clinical trials and could result in a restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including Health Canada or the European Commission.\nThere were no Grade 4 or Grade 5 serious adverse events that were considered by the clinical investigators to be related to Vicinium during the Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC. There was one Grade 5 serious adverse event, or death, which was determined by the clinical investigator to be unrelated to Vicinium. The most common reported treatment-related adverse events were an abnormally frequent passage of small amounts of urine, blood in the urine and painful urination, the majority of which were considered to be mild or moderate in severity. No patients discontinued treatment due to a Vicinium-related adverse event during the Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials.\nAs of the May 29, 2019 data cutoff date, in patients across all cohorts (n=133) of our Phase 3 VISTA Trial of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, 88% experienced at least one adverse event, with 95% of adverse events being Grade 1 or 2. The most commonly reported treatment-related adverse events were dysuria (14%), hematuria (13%) and urinary tract infection (12%) - all of which are consistent with the profile of bladder cancer patients and the use of catheterization for treatment delivery. These adverse events were determined by the clinical investigators to be manageable and reversible, and only four patients (3%) discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. Serious adverse events, regardless of treatment attribution, were reported in 14% of patients. There were four treatment-related serious adverse events reported in three patients including acute kidney injury (Grade 3), pyrexia (Grade 2), cholestatic hepatitis (Grade 4) and renal failure (Grade 5). There were no age-related increases in adverse events observed in the VISTA Trial.\nIn addition, side effects and serious adverse events or further safety or toxicity issues that we may experience in our clinical trials or in post-marketing experience could lead to the FDA's imposition of a REMS or other post-marketing obligations, which could hinder us from generating revenues or achieving profitability. Results of our clinical trials could reveal an unacceptably high severity and prevalence of side effects or serious adverse events. As a result, our clinical trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including Health Canada, the EMA and the European Commission, could order us to cease further development or deny approval of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC. The related drug-side effects or serious adverse events in our clinical trials could affect clinical trial patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the clinical trial or result in potential product liability claims.\nAdditionally, if Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects or serious adverse events caused by Vicinium, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022\nwe may suspend or be forced to suspend marketing of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC;\n\u2022\nwe may be obliged to conduct a product recall or product withdrawal;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may suspend, vary, or withdraw their approvals of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may order the seizure or recall of Vicinium;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label or a REMS that could diminish the usage or otherwise limit the commercial success of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to conduct post-marketing studies;\n\u2022\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n\u2022\nwe could be required to pay fines and face other administrative, civil and criminal penalties; and\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, if approved.\nWe will need to obtain FDA approval of any proposed names for Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, and any failure or delay associated with such naming approval may adversely impact our business.\nOn October 30, 2019, we submitted our proposed proprietary name request for Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC to the FDA. We have not yet submitted our proprietary name request for Vicinium to any foreign regulatory authority, including Health Canada or the European Commission, for provisional approval. Any proprietary name we propose to use with Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC in the United States will be subject to review by the FDA, regardless of whether we have registered it, or applied to register it, as a trademark. The FDA reviews any proposed product name, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other product names. The FDA may also object to a product name if it believes the name\ninappropriately implies medical claims or contributes to an overstatement of efficacy. If the FDA objects to any proposed proprietary product name, we may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable proprietary product name that would qualify under applicable laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA. However, this approval is subject to further and final review by the FDA at the time of BLA review.\nWe may attempt to secure approval for Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC from the FDA or comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities through the use of accelerated approval pathways. If unable to obtain approval under an accelerated pathway, we may be required to conduct additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials beyond those that we contemplate, which could increase the expense of obtaining, and delay the receipt of, necessary marketing approvals. Even if we receive accelerated approval from the FDA, if our confirmatory trials do not verify clinical benefit, or if we do not comply with rigorous post-marketing requirements, the FDA may seek to withdraw accelerated approval.\nWe are seeking approval for Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC under the accelerated approval pathway. Under the accelerated approval provisions in the FDCA and the FDA\u2019s implementing regulations, the FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product designed to treat a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage over available therapies and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint or intermediate clinical endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA considers a clinical benefit to be a positive therapeutic effect that is clinically meaningful in the context of a given disease. For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit.\nThere can be no assurance that the FDA will agree that our proposed primary endpoint of a pivotal study is an appropriate surrogate endpoint. There also can be no assurance that, after our evaluation of the feedback from the FDA or other factors, we will decide to pursue or submit a BLA for accelerated approval or any other form of expedited development, review or approval. Furthermore, if we submit an application for accelerated approval, there can be no assurance that such application will be accepted or that approval will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. The FDA or foreign regulatory authorities also could require us to conduct further studies prior to considering our application or granting approval of any type. We might not be able to fulfill the FDA\u2019s requirements in a timely manner, which would cause delays, or approval might not be granted because our submission is deemed incomplete by the FDA. A failure to obtain accelerated approval or any other form of expedited development, review or approval for Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC would result in a longer time period to commercialize Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, could increase the cost of development of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC and could harm our competitive position in the marketplace.\nMoreover, even if we receive accelerated approval from the FDA, we will be subject to rigorous post-marketing requirements, including the completion of confirmatory post-market clinical trial(s) to verify the clinical benefit of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, and submission to the FDA of all promotional materials 30-120 days prior to their dissemination. The FDA could seek to withdraw accelerated approval for multiple reasons, including if we fail to conduct any required post-market study with due diligence, a post-market study does not confirm the predicted clinical benefit, other evidence shows that the product is not safe or effective under the conditions of use, or we disseminate promotional materials that are found by the FDA to be false and misleading.\nBecause we plan to produce commercial supply of our product candidate Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, if approved, through a third-party manufacturer, the FDA will require us to demonstrate that the product manufactured by our third-party manufacturer is comparable in quality, safety, and efficacy to the product that was used in our clinical trials. If we experience challenges in demonstrating comparability, or if the FDA requires additional nonclinical or clinical studies to demonstrate comparability, the approval and/or commercialization of Vicinium could be delayed, adversely affected or terminated, or may result in significantly higher costs.\nOur product candidate, Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, has been produced in our own manufacturing facility for all clinical trials for Vicinium to date, including our ongoing Phase 3 VISTA Trial. In September 2017, we completed the manufacturing of all Vicinium necessary for our ongoing Phase 3 VISTA Trial and for our CRADA with the NCI. We intend to utilize a third-party manufacturer to produce the commercial supply of Vicinium, if approved, and have had discussions with the FDA regarding the criteria for demonstrating comparability of Vicinium produced by our third-party manufacturer to Vicinium produced in our own manufacturing facility. In October 2018, we entered into the Fujifilm MSA for the manufacturing process and technology transfer of Vicinium drug substance production. In April 2019, the first full, commercial-scale cGMP run was completed at Fujifilm. Full quality release testing has been completed and all Phase 3 release specifications were met, supporting Fujifilm\u2019s ability to produce the bulk drug substance form of Vicinium for commercial purposes if we receive regulatory approval to market Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC.\nAlthough we do not anticipate changes to the raw materials, formulations or properties nor do we anticipate changes to the Vicinium manufacturing process or finished product specifications as a result of this transfer, because this manufacturing change is being introduced at an advanced stage of development of Vicinium, the FDA may require a comprehensive comparability assessment, potentially including additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials utilizing Vicinium produced by our third-party manufacturer, and/or a modification of our ongoing Phase 3 VISTA Trial to include Vicinium produced by our third-party manufacturer. Such requirements could result in lengthy delays and significantly higher costs for the clinical development, acceptance of a BLA, and potential commercialization of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC. If we are unable to demonstrate comparability of Vicinium produced in our own manufacturing to Vicinium produced by our third-party manufacturer, we may not be able to obtain approval of a BLA for Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC.\nIf we are unable to effectively transfer our manufacturing process to our third-party manufacturer, we may be unable to continue the clinical development of or continue to seek marketing approval of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC. If we are able to effectively complete the transfer of certain of our manufacturing processes and technologies to FujiFilm, the manufacturing facilities used by Fujifilm to manufacture the bulk drug substance form of Vicinium will be subject to inspections by the FDA, and we will depend on Fujifilm\u2019s ability to comply with cGMP or other applicable regulatory standards. If they cannot successfully manufacture material in compliance with these strict regulatory requirements, we and they will not be able to secure or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. If the FDA does not approve the manufacturing facilities of Fujifilm with respect to the manufacture of the materials covered under the Fujifilm MSA, Fujifilm\u2019s ability to produce the bulk drug substance form of Vicinium on a commercial-scale could be delayed which could adversely affect our ability to commercialize Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC. We and Fujifilm also may be subject to penalties and sanctions from the FDA for any violations of applicable regulatory requirements.\nRisks Related to the Commercialization of Vicinium\nOur commercial success depends upon attaining significant market acceptance of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, if approved, among physicians, patients, third-party payors and the medical community.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, Vicinium may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, third-party payors or the medical community. Vicinium based on our TFPT platform, which is a new technology and therapeutic approach. Market participants with significant influence over acceptance of new treatments, such as physicians and third-party payors, may not adopt a product or treatment based on our TFPT platform and technologies, and we may not be able to convince the medical community and third-party payors to accept and use, or to provide favorable reimbursement for, Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC. Market acceptance of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, if approved, depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe perceived quality, efficacy and safety of Vicinium;\n\u2022\nclinical indications for which Vicinium is approved;\n\u2022\navailability of alternative effective treatments for high-risk NMIBC and the relative risks, benefits and costs of those treatments;\n\u2022\nacceptance by physicians, major operators of cancer clinics and patients of Vicinium as a safe and effective treatment for high-risk NMIBC;\n\u2022\nthe success of our physician education programs;\n\u2022\npotential and perceived advantages of Vicinium over alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nsafety of Vicinium seen in a broader patient group, potentially including its use outside the approved indication should physicians choose to prescribe them for such uses;\n\u2022\nprevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022\nany new or unexpected results from additional clinical trials or further analysis of clinical data of completed clinical trials by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nproduct labeling or patient information requirements imposed by the FDA;\n\u2022\ntiming of market introduction of Vicinium as well as competitive products;\n\u2022\nthe pricing of our treatments, particularly in relation to alternative treatments, and willingness and ability of patients to pay for Vicinium;\n\u2022\navailability of coverage and adequate reimbursement and pricing by third-party payors and government authorities;\n\u2022\nmaintaining compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration; and\n\u2022\neffectiveness of our sales, marketing and distribution efforts and operations.\nIf Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC is approved but fails to achieve market acceptance among physicians, patients, third-party payors or the medical community, we may not be able to generate significant revenues, which would compromise our ability to become profitable.\nThe market opportunity for Vicinium may be limited to those patients who are ineligible for established therapies or for whom prior therapies have failed, and may be small.\nCancer therapies are sometimes characterized as first-line, second-line or third-line. When cancer is detected early enough, first-line therapy, usually chemotherapy, hormone therapy, surgery, radiotherapy or a combination of these, is sometimes adequate to cure the cancer or prolong life without a cure. Second-line and third-line therapies are administered to patients when prior therapy is not effective. We are seeking approval of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC after prior therapies have failed.\nOur projections of both the number of people who have high-risk NMIBC, as well as the subset of people with this cancer who have previously failed prior treatments, and who have the potential to benefit from treatment with Vicinium, are based on our beliefs and estimates. These estimates have been derived from a variety of sources, including scientific literature, surveys of clinics, patient foundations or market research, and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these cancers and the number of patients may turn out to be lower than expected. Even if we receive regulatory approval for Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC and obtain significant market share, because the potential target population is small, we may never achieve profitability without obtaining regulatory approval for additional indications, including the use of Vicinium as a first-line therapy.\nOur commercial success could depend upon the continued marketing of another company\u2019s approved product, or the approval of another company\u2019s product candidate, that is administered with our product candidates.\nSome of our future clinical trials and some of the indications for which we are developing our product candidates may involve the use of our product candidates in combination with other companies\u2019 marketed products or product candidates. These marketed products or product candidates may be administered in a clinical trial in combination with one or more of our product candidates. In the event that any of these pharmaceutical companies has unforeseen issues that negatively impacts the clinical development, marketing approval or availability of its product or product candidate or otherwise opts to discontinue clinical development or marketing of its product or product candidate, our ability to complete our applicable clinical trials and/or evaluate clinical results for our product candidate in combination with the other company\u2019s marketed product or product candidate may be negatively impacted. As a result, this could adversely affect our ability to file for, obtain, or maintain regulatory approval for our product candidate on a timely basis, or at all. For example, under the terms of the CRADA, the NCI will conduct a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with high-risk NMIBC to evaluate the safety, efficacy and biological correlates of Vicinium in combination with durvalumab.\nIf we are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we may not be successful in commercializing Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, if and when it is approved.\nWe do not have a sales or marketing infrastructure and have no experience in the sale, marketing or distribution of therapeutic products. To achieve commercial success for Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, if approved, we will need to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, either ourselves or through collaborations or other arrangements with third parties.\nThere are risks involved with establishing our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, if approved, on our own include:\n\u2022\nour inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022\nthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe our products;\n\u2022\nthe lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u2022\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nWe may enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing and distribution services in markets outside the United States. We may also enter into arrangements with third parties to perform these services in the United States if we do not establish our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities in the United States or if we determine that such third-party arrangements are otherwise beneficial. Our product revenues and our profitability, if any, under any such third-party sales, marketing or distribution arrangements are likely to be lower than if we were to market, sell and distribute Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC ourselves. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties\nto sell, market and distribute Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, if approved, or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, if approved, effectively. If we do not establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, if approved.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new biologics products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC from both large and small pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and other research organizations. There are a number of large pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC. For instance, in January 2020, the FDA approved Merck & Co., Inc.'s Keytruda (pembrolizumab) as a systemic monotherapy to treat patients with BCG-unresponsive, high-risk NMIBC with CIS with or without papillary tumors who are ineligible for or have elected not to undergo cystectomy. In addition, FerGene Inc. is developing Adstiladrin (nadofaragene firadenovec (rAd-IFN/Syn3) for high-grade BCG-unresponsive NMIBC for the United States market and presented Phase 3 data in December 2019, and its BLA has been accepted by the FDA for review. There is intense and rapidly evolving competition in the biotechnology, biopharmaceutical and antibody fragment and immuno-oncology therapeutics fields. Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are similar to our approach, and others are based on entirely different approaches.\nWe also face substantial competition with respect to our EBI-031 program. The current standard of care for diabetic macular edema (\"DME\") includes anti-VEGF therapies and corticosteroids. Some patients with DME are effectively treated by the current standard of care therapies. Approved anti-VEGF therapies for treating DME include Lucentis (ranibizumab) and Eylea\u00ae (aflibercept). Off-label use of Avastin (bevacizumab) is also seen in DME. Approved corticosteroid therapies include Ozurdex (dexamethasone implant) and Iluvien (fluocinolone implant). Laser photocoagulation was historically the standard of care for treating DME, in particular for a subcategory of DME called clinically significant macular edema, and is still used to treat some DME patients. However, anti-VEGF therapy has been proven in clinical trials to have superior efficacy over laser photocoagulation. Our competitors for treating DME include, but are not limited to, Novartis (Brolucizumab), Opthea Limited (OPT-302 in combination with aflibercept), Roche (Faricimab) and Kodiak Sciences Inc. (KSI-301).\nOur commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than product candidates that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.\nIn addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors, particularly Medicare, seeking to encourage the use of generic drug products. Generic products are currently being used as part of the standard of care for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If any product candidate that we may develop achieves marketing approval, we expect that it will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products.\nMore established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their greater size, cash resources and institutional experience. Compared to us, many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources. As a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their product candidates before we are able to, which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are safer, more effective, more widely used and less expensive than ours, and may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products. These appreciable advantages could render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of development and commercialization.\nIf the value framework published by ASCO to assess the value of cancer treatment options is adopted and utilized by payors and physicians and we were to receive low ratings, it could adversely affect the price and reimbursement of Vicinium, if approved, reduce prescriptions and harm our business.\nOn May 31, 2016, ASCO published a framework to assess the value of cancer treatment options. The framework was developed in response to concern that new, expensive cancer treatments may not be supported by adequate medical evidence. The purpose of the framework is to provide a standardized quantification of cancer treatments and assist oncologists and patients in deciding between new cancer treatments and the standard of care. The framework takes into account a medication\u2019s (i) efficacy, (ii) safety and (iii) cost, to derive an overall treatment value.\nWhile we believe that the safety and efficacy profiles of our product candidates are potentially better than that of the standard of care and, if approved, we intend to price our products competitively, we do not know how the data will be assessed by ASCO. It is also unknown whether use of this application could adversely affect the assessment of any of our product candidates. If this framework were adopted and utilized by payors and physicians, and if Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC were to receive low ratings, this could adversely affect the price and reimbursement of Vicinium, if approved, reduce prescriptions and harm our business.\nEven if we are able to commercialize Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, it may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party coverage or reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which could harm our business.\nOur ability to commercialize Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for Vicinium will be available from government healthcare programs, private health insurers, managed care plans and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Coverage and reimbursement may not be available for Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, if approved, and, even if they are available, the level of reimbursement may not be satisfactory.\nInadequate reimbursement may adversely affect the demand for, or the price of, Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, if approved. Obtaining and maintaining adequate reimbursement for Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC may be difficult. We may be required to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to justify coverage and reimbursement or the level of reimbursement relative to other therapies. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, if approved.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the indications for which the drug is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, including Health Canada, or the European Commission. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution expenses. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the clinical setting in which a drug is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, if approved, would compromise our ability to generate revenues and become profitable.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC in that country. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC to other available therapies. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, even if Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC obtains marketing approval.\nThere can be no assurance that Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, any of our other product candidates or any products that we may in-license, if they are approved for sale in the United States or in other countries, will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that they will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that coverage and an adequate level of reimbursement will be available, or that third-party payors\u2019 reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably. In addition, we are unable to predict what changes in legislation\nor regulation relating to the health care industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future and how such legislation or regulation could impact our business. See the risk factor entitled \u201cCurrent and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC and affect the prices we, or they, may obtain\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information, including with respect to the ACA.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, if approved.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the use of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC and will face an even greater risk if Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC receives marketing approval and is commercialized. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial patients;\n\u2022\nsignificant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial patients;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue;\n\u2022\nreduced time and attention of our management to pursue our business strategy; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC.\nWe currently hold $10.0 million CAD in product liability insurance coverage in the aggregate, with a per incident limit of $10.0 million CAD, which may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We would need to increase our insurance coverage if we expand our clinical development activities beyond historical levels. We would need to further increase our insurance coverage if Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC is approved and we commence commercialization. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nWe conduct certain elements of our business internationally, and the decisions of sovereign governments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nViventia was founded as a Canadian company and conducted its business internationally. In addition to our clinical trials in the United States and Canada, Viventia has historically conducted clinical trials in Russia and Brazil. We intend to, and may, conduct clinical trials in other jurisdictions. Sovereign governments, including Canada, may establish laws or regulations that will be deleterious to our interests or that will affect our ability, to obtain access to regulatory agencies in Russia, Brazil, Canada, and/or other jurisdictions. Governments have also, from time to time, established foreign exchange controls which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To date, neither our operations nor our financial condition have been materially impacted due to laws or regulations of sovereign governments.\nRisks Related to the License Agreement with Roche\nWe depend on our License Agreement with Roche for the development and commercialization of EBI-031.\nIn June 2016, we entered into the License Agreement with Roche, pursuant to which we granted Roche an exclusive, worldwide license, including the right to sublicense, to the Licensed Intellectual Property. Under the License Agreement, Roche is required to continue developing, at its cost, EBI-031 and any other product made from the Licensed Intellectual Property that contains a Licensed Product and pursue ongoing patent prosecution, at its cost. At the time of the License Agreement, EBI-031, which was derived using our previous AMP-Rx platform, was in pre-clinical development as an intravitreal injection for diabetic macular edema and uveitis.\nWe received from Roche an upfront license fee of $7.5 million in August 2016 upon the effectiveness of the License Agreement with Roche following approval by our stockholders, and Roche agreed to pay up to an additional $262.5 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory, development and commercial milestones with respect to up to two unrelated indications. Specifically, an aggregate amount of up to $197.5 million is payable to us for the achievement of specified milestones with respect to the first indication, consisting of $72.5 million in development milestones, $50.0 million in regulatory milestones and $75.0 million in commercialization milestones. In September 2016, Roche paid us the first development milestone of $22.5 million as a result of the IND application for EBI-031 becoming effective on or before September 15, 2016. Additional amounts of up to $65.0 million are payable upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones in a second indication.\nIn addition, we are entitled to receive royalty payments in accordance with a tiered royalty rate scale, with rates ranging from 7.5% to 15% of net sales of potential future products containing EBI-031 and up to 50% of these rates for net sales of potential future products containing other IL-6 compounds, with each of the royalties subject to reduction under certain circumstances and to the buy-out options of Roche.\nThe License Agreement with Roche provides for two \u201coption periods\u201d during which Roche may elect to make a one-time payment to us and, in turn, terminate its diligence, milestone and royalty payment obligations under the License Agreement. Specifically, (i) Roche may exercise a buy-out option following the first dosing (\"Initiation\") in the first Phase 2 study for a Licensed Product until the day before Initiation of the first Phase 3 study for a Licensed Product, in which case Roche is required to pay us $135.0 million within 30 days after Roche\u2019s exercise of such buy-out option and receipt of an invoice from us, or (ii) Roche may exercise a buy-out option following the day after Initiation of the first Phase 3 study for a Licensed Product until the day before the acceptance for review by the FDA or other regulatory authority of a BLA or similar application for marketing approval for a Licensed Product in either the United States or in the E.U., in which case Roche is required to pay us, within 30 days after Roche\u2019s exercise of such buy-out option and receipt of an invoice from us, $265.0 million, which amount would be reduced to $220.0 million if none of our patent rights containing a composition of matter claim covering any compound or Licensed Product has issued in the E.U.\nThe right to potential future payments under the License Agreement with Roche represents a significant portion of the value of the License Agreement to us. We cannot be certain that we will receive any future payments under the License Agreement, which would adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our business prospects.\nAdditionally, if Roche were to breach or terminate the License Agreement, we may not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for EBI-031 and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize EBI-031. We may not be able to seek and obtain a viable, alternative collaborator to partner for the development and commercialization of the licensed products on similar terms, or at all.\nThe successful commercialization and continued development of EBI-031 depends substantially on the License Agreement with Roche. If Roche is unable or unwilling to commercialize or further develop EBI-031, or experiences significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nIn June 2016, we entered into the License Agreement with Roche for the development and commercialization of EBI-031. Prior to this agreement, we did not have a history of working with Roche. The License Agreement provides for milestone payments to us based on the achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones, and provides us with royalty-based revenue if EBI-031 is successfully commercialized. We cannot predict the success of the License Agreement.\nWe are substantially dependent on Roche to develop and commercialize EBI-031. Under the License Agreement, Roche has significant control over the conduct and timing of development and commercialization efforts with respect to EBI-031. We have little control over the amount, timing and quality of resources that Roche devotes to the development or commercialization of EBI-031. If Roche fails to devote sufficient financial and other resources to the future development or commercialization of EBI-031, the development and commercialization of EBI-031 would be delayed or could fail. This would result in a delay in our receiving milestone payments or royalties at all.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe may enter into collaborations or license agreements with third parties for the development or commercialization of our product candidates. If our collaborations or licenses are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these product candidates.\nWe may seek third-party collaborators or licensees for development and commercialization of our product candidates, including Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC. Our likely collaborators or licensees for any sales, marketing, distribution, development, licensing or broader collaboration arrangements include large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies. We are not currently party to any such arrangement, other than the License Agreement with Roche. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators\u2019 or licensee's abilities and efforts to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.\nCollaborations and licenses involving our product candidates, including the License Agreement with Roche, pose a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\ncollaborators or licensees have significant discretion in determining the amount and timing of efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations or licenses;\n\u2022\ncollaborators or licensees may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u2022\ncollaborators or licensees may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates that receive marketing approval or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on\nclinical trial results, changes in the collaborators\u2019 or licensees' strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities;\n\u2022\ncollaborators or licensees may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022\ncollaborators or licensees could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the collaborators or licensees believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u2022\nproduct candidates discovered under the collaboration or license with us may be viewed by our collaborators or licensees as competitive with their own product candidates or products, which may cause collaborators or licensees to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u2022\na collaborator or licensee with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our product candidates that achieve regulatory approval may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products;\n\u2022\ndisagreements with collaborators or licensees, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would divert management attention and resources, be time-consuming and expensive;\n\u2022\ncollaborators or licensees may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u2022\ncollaborators or licensees may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability; and\n\u2022\ncollaborations or licenses may be terminated for the convenience of the collaborator or licensee and, if terminated, we could be required to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates.\nCollaboration agreements and licenses may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner, or at all. If any collaborations or licenses that we enter into, do not result in the successful development and commercialization of products or if one of our collaborators or licensees terminates its agreement with us, we may not receive any future research funding or milestone or royalty payments under the collaboration or license. All of the risks relating to product development, regulatory approval and commercialization described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K would also apply to the activities of any collaborators and licensees.\nAdditionally, subject to its contractual obligations to us, if a collaborator or licensee of ours were to be involved in a business combination, it might deemphasize or terminate the development or commercialization of any product candidate licensed to it by us. If one of our collaborators or licensees terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to attract new collaborators or licensees and our perception in the business and financial communities could be harmed.\nIf we are not able to establish additional collaborations, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans and our business could be adversely affected.\nFor some of our product candidates, we may decide to collaborate with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of such product candidates, including Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Whether we reach a definitive collaboration agreement will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, including Health Canada, or the European Commission, the potential market for the product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions generally. The collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate. We may also be restricted under future license agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms with potential collaborators. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators.\nIf we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other\ndevelopment programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to fund and undertake development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to enter into collaborations and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development and commercialization activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market or continue to develop our product platform.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe rely on domestic and international third-party CROs to monitor and manage data for our pre-clinical and clinical programs. We rely on these parties for execution of our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, and we control only some aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We also rely on third parties to assist in conducting our pre-clinical studies in accordance with cGLP and the Animal Welfare Act requirements. We and our CROs are required to comply with U.S. federal regulations and cGCP, which are international standards meant to protect the rights and health of patients and assure the credibility of clinical trial data that are enforced by the FDA, Health Canada, the competent authorities of the E.U. Member States and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of our product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce cGCP through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable cGCP, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including Health Canada and the EMA, may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with cGCP requirements. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP requirements. Failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nOur CROs are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such CROs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing clinical, non-clinical and pre-clinical programs. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nBecause we have relied and will continue to rely on third parties, our internal capacity to perform these functions is limited. Outsourcing these functions involves risk that third parties may not perform to our standards, may not produce results in a timely manner or may fail to perform at all. In addition, the use of third-party service providers requires us to disclose our proprietary information to these parties, which could increase the risk that this information will be misappropriated. We currently have a small number of employees, which limits the internal resources we have available to identify and monitor our third-party providers. To the extent we are unable to identify and successfully manage the performance of third-party service providers in the future, our business may be adversely affected. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nIf we lose our relationships with CROs, our product development efforts could be delayed.\nWe rely on domestic and international third-party vendors and CROs for pre-clinical studies and clinical trials related to our product development efforts. Switching or adding additional CROs would involve additional cost and requires management time and focus. Our CROs generally have the right to terminate their agreements with us in the event of an uncured material breach. In addition, some of our CROs have an ability to terminate their respective agreements and/or research projects with us pursuant to such agreements if it can be reasonably demonstrated that the safety of the patients participating in our clinical trials warrants such termination in accordance with the reasonable opinion of the relevant CRO. Identifying, qualifying and managing performance of third-party service providers can be difficult, time consuming and cause delays in our development programs. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work and the new CRO may not provide the same type or level of services as the original provider. If any of our relationships with our third-party CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or to do so on commercially reasonable terms.\nOur experience manufacturing Vicinium is limited to our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. We have no experience manufacturing Vicinium on a commercial scale. We are dependent on third parties for our supply chain, and if we experience problems with any such third parties, the manufacturing of Vicinium could be delayed.\nWe lease a 31,100 square foot manufacturing, laboratory, warehouse and office facility in Winnipeg, Manitoba. We have three 15-liter fermenters, one 30-liter fermenter, one 150-liter fermenter, one 500-liter fermenter and one 1,500-liter fermenter. Our classified fermentation suite and post-production processing capabilities were dedicated to producing our pre-clinical study and clinical trial batches of Vicinium. In September 2017, we completed the manufacturing of all Vicinium necessary for our ongoing Phase 3 VISTA Trial and for our CRADA with the NCI. In conjunction with this achievement, we ended our manufacturing activities in Winnipeg and have redirected our resources toward completing the technology transfer process necessary to outsource commercial scale drug supply manufacturing in the event we obtain approval from the FDA to market Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC.\nIn October 2018, we entered into the Fujifilm MSA for the manufacturing process and technology transfer of Vicinium drug substance production. In April 2019, the first full, commercial-scale cGMP run was completed at Fujifilm. Full quality release testing has been completed and all Phase 3 release specifications were met, supporting Fujifilm\u2019s ability to produce the bulk drug substance form of Vicinium for commercial purposes if we receive regulatory approval to market Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC.\nOur manufacturing facility was audited by a third party in July 2018 to assess our commercial manufacturing capabilities. It was concluded from the audit that facility upgrades would be required for commercial manufacturing. Our manufacturing facility was also audited by a third party for compliance with cGMP in January 2014 and it did not identify any major impediments to the cGMP manufacturing of product candidates up to and including Phase 3 production. Manufacturing of drugs and product candidates, including Vicinium and VB6-845d, must comply with cGMP standards and other regulations. Methods of manufacture as well as validation of manufacturing procedures and quality control systems are reviewed by regulatory authorities, such as the FDA, Health Canada and the competent authorities of the E.U. Member States, to determine their effect on the quality, purity and potency of product candidates. All such manufacturing procedures, validation programs and quality assessment activities must be properly documented in accordance with regulatory requirements. The FDA, Health Canada and the competent authorities of the E.U. Member States conduct inspections to determine compliance with cGMP to ensure that product candidates used in human testing are adequately characterized in terms of identity, potency and purity. In general, the cGMP standards expected for marketed drugs also apply to the supply of product candidates evaluated in most stages of clinical testing.\nThe facilities used by Fujifilm and any other CMO we may utilize to manufacture Vicinium must be the subject of a satisfactory inspection before the FDA and other applicable regulatory authorities approve a BLA or marketing authorization for Vicinium manufactured at that facility. We will depend on these third-party manufacturing partners for compliance with the FDA\u2019s, E.U.'s and comparable foreign regulatory authorities\u2019, including Health Canada\u2019s, requirements for the manufacture of Vicinium, if approved.\nAny significant disruption in our supplier relationships could harm our business. Any significant delay in the supply of a product candidate or its key materials for an ongoing pre-clinical study or clinical trial could considerably delay completion of such pre-clinical study or clinical trial, product testing and potential regulatory approval of a product candidate. If our CMOs or we are unable to purchase these key materials after regulatory approval has been obtained for a product candidate, the commercial launch of such product candidate would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply, which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of such product candidate.\nIn the event that manufacturing process changes are necessary for the further development of a product candidate, we may not be able to reach agreement with regulatory agencies on the criteria for demonstrating comparability to the original product, which would require us to repeat clinical trials performed with the original product. This could result in lengthy delays in implementing the new process or site and substantial lost sales as a result of our inability to meet commercial demand. If we reach agreement with regulatory agencies on the criteria for establishing comparability, we may not be able to meet these criteria or may suffer lengthy delays in meeting these criteria. This may result in significant lost sales due to inability to meet commercial demand with the original product. Furthermore, studies to demonstrate comparability, or any other studies on the new process or site such as validation studies, may uncover findings that result in regulatory agencies delaying or refusing to approve the new process or site.\nIf we encounter difficulties in identifying and/or negotiating a commercial manufacturing agreement with a third party manufacturer of Vicinium, or if we experience problems with the third-party manufacturer, the manufacturing of Vicinium and our product development and commercialization efforts may be delayed, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, and our costs may be higher than expected, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe intend to rely upon a third-party manufacturer for the commercial supply of Vicinium. Our reliance on a third-party manufacturer will expose us to certain risks that we would not be subject to if we manufactured Vicinium ourselves, including:\n\u2022\nThe development of commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities may require our third-party manufacturer to invest substantial additional funds and hire and retain technical personnel who have the necessary manufacturing experience. Our third-party manufacturer may fail to devote sufficient time and resources to develop the capabilities to manufacture Vicinium.\n\u2022\nBecause of the complex nature of Vicinium, our third party manufacturer, or other third parties we rely on, may encounter difficulties in achieving the volume of production needed to satisfy commercial demand, may not be able to achieve such volume at an acceptable cost, may experience technical issues that impact comparability, quality, or compliance with applicable regulations governing the manufacture of biological products, and may experience shortages of qualified personnel to adequately staff production operations.\n\u2022\nOur third-party manufacturer could default on its agreement with us to meet our requirements for commercialization of Vicinium, or it may terminate or decide not to renew its agreement with us, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or damaging to us. If our third-party manufacturer were to terminate our arrangement or fail to meet our commercial manufacturing demands, we may be delayed in our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval of Vicinium or, if approved, commercialize Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC.\n\u2022\nIt may be difficult or impossible for us to find a replacement manufacturer on acceptable terms quickly, or at all. Identifying alternate manufacturers may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers that have the necessary expertise to produce biologics is limited. Additionally, the FDA must approve any alternative manufacturer before we may use the alternative manufacturer to produce commercial supply of Vicinium, if approved.\nOur reliance on a third-party manufacturer reduces our control over our commercialization activities but does not relieve us of our responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable legal and regulatory standards. The FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities require that our product candidates and any products that we may eventually commercialize be manufactured according to cGMP and similar foreign standards. Any failure by our third-party manufacturer to comply with cGMP or to scale up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities of product candidates in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval of any of our product candidates. In addition, such failure could be the basis for the FDA or any other foreign regulatory authorities including Health Canada, the European Commission or the competent authorities of the E.U. Member States to issue a warning or untitled letter, withdraw approvals for product candidates previously granted to us, or take other regulatory or legal action, including recall or seizure, total or partial suspension of production, suspension of ongoing clinical trials, refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, detention of product, refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunction, imposing administrative or civil penalties, or pursuing criminal prosecution.\nAny contamination in our manufacturing process, shortages of raw materials or failure of any of our key suppliers to deliver necessary components of our TFPT platform could result in delays in our timing for clinical development or obtaining marketing approval.\nGiven the nature of biologics manufacturing, there is a risk of contamination. Any contamination could materially adversely affect our ability to produce our product candidates on schedule and could therefore halt or delay our clinical development programs.\nSome of the raw materials required in our manufacturing process are derived from biological sources. Such raw materials are difficult to procure and may also be subject to contamination or recall. A material shortage, contamination, recall, or restriction on the use of biologically derived substances in the manufacture of our product candidates could halt or delay our clinical development programs or disrupt the commercial manufacturing of our product candidates, if approved, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if our licensors are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for the technology or products that we license from them, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be impaired.\nOur success depends in large part on our and our licensors\u2019 ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. We and our licensors have sought to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies and product candidates. The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications in jurisdictions of interest at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, in some circumstances, we do not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology that we license from third parties. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If such licensors fail to maintain such patents, or lose rights to those patents, the rights we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our and our licensors\u2019 patent rights are highly uncertain. Our and our licensors\u2019 pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than United States law does. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our owned or licensed patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. In particular, during prosecution of any patent application, the issuance of any patents based on the application may depend upon our ability to generate additional pre-clinical or clinical data that support the patentability of our proposed claims. We may not be able to generate sufficient additional data on a timely basis, or at all. Moreover, changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nMoreover, we may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art to the USPTO or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates. In addition, invalidation of our patent rights by third parties could jeopardize the anticipated revenue streams from current licensees.\nEven if our owned and licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nChanges in United States patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nAs is the case with other biotechnology companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biotechnology industry involve both technological and legal complexity, and is therefore costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. For example, the United States previously enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Specifically, on September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the \"Leahy-Smith Act\") was signed into law and included a number of significant changes to United States patent law, and many of the provisions became effective in March 2013. However, it may take the courts years to interpret the provisions of the Leahy-Smith Act, and the implementation of the statute could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our licensed and future patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our licensed and future patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the United States Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the United States Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce patents that we might obtain in the future.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on all of our product candidates and technologies throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our or our licensors\u2019 intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws and practices of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Moreover, the intellectual property laws of the United States change over time. For example, several United States Supreme Court cases have redefined what is considered to be patentable subject matter. Consequently, we and our licensors may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our and our licensors\u2019 inventions in all countries inside or outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our and our licensors\u2019 inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and may export infringing products to territories where we or our licensors have patent protection, but where enforcement is not as strong as in the United States. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our or our licensor\u2019s patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally in those countries. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our and our licensors\u2019 patents at risk of being invalidated or being interpreted narrowly and put our and our licensors\u2019 patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us or our licensors. We or our licensors may not prevail in any lawsuits that we or our licensors initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful.\nThe laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and these foreign laws may also be subject to change. For example, methods of treatment and manufacturing processes may not be patentable in certain jurisdictions, and the requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries. Furthermore, generic and/or biosimilar product manufacturers or other competitors may challenge the scope, validity or enforceability of our or our licensors\u2019 patents, requiring us or our licensors to engage in complex, lengthy and costly litigation or other proceedings.\nGeneric or biosimilar product manufacturers may develop, seek approval for, and launch biosimilar versions or generic versions, respectively, of our products. The FDA published draft guidance documents on biosimilar product development. If a biosimilar product is also found to be interchangeable with a reference product, it may be substituted for the reference product. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation, which are still being worked out by the FDA. If any of our product candidates are approved by the FDA, the approval of a biologic product biosimilar to or interchangeable with one of our products could have a material impact on our business. In particular, a biosimilar could be significantly less costly to bring to market and priced significantly lower than our products, if approved by the FDA.\nMany countries, including E.U. countries, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled under certain circumstances to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we and our licensors may have limited remedies if patents are infringed or if we or our licensors are compelled to grant a license to a third party, which\ncould materially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our and our licensors\u2019 efforts to enforce intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we own or license.\nWe have not yet registered our trademarks in all of our potential markets, and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business.\nOur future trademark applications may not be allowed for registration, and our registered trademarks may not be maintained or enforced. During trademark registration proceedings, we may receive rejections from the USPTO or other applicable foreign intellectual property offices. Although we are given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we may be unable to overcome such rejections, or have to expend additional resources to secure registrations, such as commencing cancellation proceedings against third-party trademark registrations to remove them as obstacles to our trademark applications. In addition, in the USPTO and in comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings. If we do not secure registrations for our trademarks, we may encounter more difficulty in enforcing them against third parties than we otherwise would.\nWe depend on our License Agreements with Zurich, Micromet and XOMA, and if we cannot meet the requirements under the agreements we could lose important rights to Vicinium, which could have material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have an exclusive License Agreement with Zurich. Pursuant to the agreement, we were granted an exclusive license, with the right to sublicense, under certain patents primarily relating, in part, to our targeting agents, EpCAM chimera and immunoconjugates (including aspects of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC and Vicinium for the treatment of SCCHN) and methods of use, to make, use, sell and import products that would otherwise infringe such patents in the field of the treatment, stasis and palliation of disease in humans. If we fail to meet our obligations under the license agreement, Zurich may have the right to terminate our license, and upon the effective date of such termination, our right to use the licensed Zurich patent rights would end. To the extent such licensed technology or patent rights relate to our product candidates, we would expect to exercise all rights and remedies available to us, including attempting to cure any breach by us, and otherwise seek to preserve our rights under the patent rights licensed to us, but we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, at an acceptable cost to us or at all. Any uncured, material breach under the license agreement could result in our loss of rights to practice the patent rights licensed to us under the license agreement, and to the extent such patent rights and other technology relate to our product candidates or other of our compounds, it could have a material adverse effect on our commercialization efforts for our product candidates, including Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC and Vicinium for the treatment of SCCHN.\nWe also have a License Agreement with Micromet, which grants us non-exclusive rights, with certain sublicense rights, for know-how and patents allowing exploitation of certain single chain antibody products. If we fail to meet our obligations under the license agreement, Micromet may have the right to terminate our license, and upon the effective date of such termination, our right to use the licensed Micromet patent rights would end. To the extent such licensed technology or patent rights relate to our product candidates, we would expect to exercise all rights and remedies available to us, including attempting to cure any breach by us, and otherwise seek to preserve our rights under the patent rights licensed to us, but we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, at an acceptable cost to us or at all. Any uncured, material breach under the license agreement could result in our loss of rights to practice the patent rights licensed to us under the license agreement, and to the extent such patent rights and other technology relate to our product candidates or other of our compounds, it could have a material adverse effect on our commercialization efforts for our product candidates, including Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC and Vicinium for the treatment of SCCHN.\nWe also have a License Agreement with XOMA, which grants us non-exclusive rights to certain XOMA patent rights and know-how related to certain expression technology, including plasmids, expression strains, plasmid maps and production systems. If we fail to meet our obligations under the license agreement, XOMA may have the right to terminate our license, and upon the effective date of such termination, our right to use the licensed XOMA patent rights and related know-how would end. To the extent such licensed technology or patent rights relate to our product candidates, we would expect to exercise all rights and remedies available to us, including attempting to cure any breach by us, and otherwise seek to preserve our rights under the patent rights licensed to us, but we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, at an acceptable cost to us or at all. Any uncured, material breach under the license agreement could result in our loss of rights to practice the patent rights licensed to us under the license agreement, and to the extent such patent rights and other technology relate to our product candidates or other of our compounds, it could have a material adverse effect on our commercialization efforts for our product candidates, including Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC and Vicinium for the treatment of SCCHN.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our issued patents or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents, trademarks or other intellectual property. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. In a trademark infringement proceeding, we could be enjoined from continued use of a trademark deemed to be infringing and forced to rebrand product packaging, product inserts, market and advertising materials, resulting in a loss of sales and established goodwill in that name or mark. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a trademark. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability, and the ability of our collaborators, to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology, including interference or derivation proceedings before the USPTO. The risks of being involved in such litigation and proceedings may increase as our product candidates near commercialization and as we gain the greater visibility associated with being a public company. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. We may not be aware of all such intellectual property rights potentially relating to our product candidates and their uses. Thus, we do not know with certainty that any product candidate, or our commercialization thereof, does not and will not infringe or otherwise violate any third party\u2019s intellectual property.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses and funding arrangements with third parties, we could lose rights that are important to our business.\nWe are party to a number of license agreements and a collaboration agreement that impose, and, for a variety of purposes, we will likely enter into additional licensing and funding arrangements with third parties that may impose, diligence, development and commercialization timelines and milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. Under certain of our existing licensing agreements, we are obligated to pay royalties or make specified milestone payments on net product sales of product candidates or related technologies to the extent they are covered by the agreement. We also are obligated under certain of our existing license agreements to pay maintenance and other fees. We also have diligence and development obligations under certain of those agreements that we are required to satisfy. If we fail to comply with our obligations under current or future license and collaboration agreements, our counterparties may have the right to terminate these agreements, in which event we might not be able to develop, manufacture or market any product that is covered by these agreements or may face other penalties under the agreements. Such an occurrence could diminish the value of the product candidate being developed under any such agreement. Termination of these agreements or reduction or elimination of our rights under these agreements may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated agreements with less favorable terms, or cause us to lose our rights under these agreements, including our rights to important intellectual property or technology.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees, consultants, independent contractors or we have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees and our licensors\u2019 employees, including our senior management, were previously employed at universities, medical institutions or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential\ncompetitors. Some of these employees, including members of our senior management, executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements, or similar agreements, in connection with such previous employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Our and their assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nIf we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could compromise our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and product candidates, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u2022\nothers may be able to make product candidates that are the same as or similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have licensed;\n\u2022\nbiosimilar product manufacturers may develop, seek approval for, and launch biosimilar versions of our products, which could be significantly less costly to bring to market and priced significantly lower than our products;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors might not have been the first inventor to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\u2022\nothers may design around our intellectual property rights or independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nit is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents with claims that cover our products or even issued patents;\n\u2022\nissued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges;\n\u2022\nour competitors might conduct research and development activities in the United States and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for certain research and development activities, as well as in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u2022\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies or product candidates that are patentable; and\n\u2022\nthe intellectual property rights of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Marketing Approval of Vicinium for the Treatment of High-Risk NMIBC and Other Legal Compliance Matters\nIf we are not able to obtain regulatory approval, or there are delays in obtaining approval, we will not be able to commercialize Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC or any other product candidate that we may develop, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired. The marketing approval process is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain. As a result, we cannot predict when or if we, or any licensees or collaborators, will obtain marketing approval to commercialize Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC or any other product candidate.\nTo date, we have not obtained approval from the FDA or any foreign regulatory authority, including Health Canada and the European Commission, to market or sell Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC or any of our product candidates. The failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. The activities associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates, including design, testing, manufacture, quality, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by the EMA, the competent authorities of the E.U. Member States, Health Canada and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. We have only limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals and expect to rely on third-party consultants to assist us in this process.\nThe process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is expensive and may take many years, especially if additional clinical trials are required, if approval is obtained at all. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive pre-clinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s quality, safety, and efficacy. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. The FDA, Health Canada, EMA or other regulatory authorities may determine that any product candidate that we may develop is not safe, effective or of appropriate quality, is only moderately effective or has undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.\nThe regulatory process can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Moreover, changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries, including Health Canada and the European Commission, have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional pre-clinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from pre-clinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. In February 2018, the FDA issued finalized guidance on developing drugs and biologics for treating BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, which sets forth certain expectations for our development of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC. We may be unable to satisfy all recommendations contained in the FDA guidance and, even if we do, it is not guaranteed that meeting all such recommendations will be sufficient to obtain marketing approval.\nThe different requirements and expectations of the EMA and Health Canada compared with the FDA may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to conduct additional studies or clinical trials, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of these product candidates or lead to significant post approval limitations or restrictions. If we experience delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired.\nOur product candidates for which we intend to seek approval as biological products may face competition sooner than expected from biosimilar products.\nWith the enactment of the BPCIA, abbreviated pathways for approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products were created. The BPCIA establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilars for marketing, as well as\nbiosimilars that have been designated as \u201cinterchangeable\u201d with a previously approved biologic, or reference product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the reference product was approved under a full BLA. This period of regulatory exclusivity runs concurrently with, but is independent of, periods of patent protection for the reference product.\nWe believe that any of our product candidates, including Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, approved as a biological product under a full BLA should qualify for a 12-year period of exclusivity. However:\n\u2022\nthe United States Congress could amend the BPCIA to significantly shorten this exclusivity period as has been previously proposed; and\n\u2022\na potential competitor could seek and obtain approval of its own BLA during our exclusivity period instead of seeking approval of a biosimilar version.\nThe BPCIA is complex and its provisions continue to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA and United States courts. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation and implications of the BPCIA are subject to uncertainty and could compromise the future commercial prospects for our biological products. Moreover, it is not yet clear the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, may be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for pharmaceutical products; this will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing at both the federal and state levels of government.\nFailure to obtain marketing approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent our product candidates from being marketed abroad, and any approval we are granted for our product candidates in the United States would not assure approval of product candidates in foreign jurisdictions.\nIn order to market and sell any product candidate that we may develop in the E.U., Canada and many other jurisdictions, we or our third-party licensees or collaborators must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be sold in that country. We or these third parties may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States, including Health Canada, or the European Commission, on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market. If we are unable to obtain approval of our product candidates by regulatory authorities in Canada, the E.U. or other jurisdictions, the commercial prospects of our product candidates may be significantly diminished and our business prospects could decline.\nEven if we, or our third-party licensees or collaborators, obtain marketing approvals for our product candidates, the terms of those approvals, ongoing regulations and post-marketing restrictions may limit how we, or they, manufacture and market our products, which could materially impair our ability to generate revenue.\nOnce marketing approval has been granted, an approved product and its manufacturer and marketer are subject to ongoing review and extensive regulation. We, and any collaborators we may have in the future, must therefore comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for any of our products for which we or they obtain marketing approval. Promotional communications with respect to prescription products are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved labeling. Thus, if any product candidate that we may develop receives marketing approval, the accompanying label may limit the approved use of our product, which could limit sales of the product.\nIn addition, manufacturers of approved products and those manufacturers\u2019 facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP, which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and reporting requirements. We, our contract manufacturers, our future collaborators and their contract manufacturers will also be subject to other regulatory requirements, including submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians, recordkeeping, and potentially costly post-marketing studies or other clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product such as the requirement to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy.\nAccordingly, assuming we receive marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates, we and our contract manufacturers will continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, product surveillance and quality control. If we are not able to comply with post-approval regulatory requirements, we could have the marketing approvals for our products withdrawn by regulatory authorities and our ability to market any\nfuture products could be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve or sustain profitability. Thus, the cost of compliance with post-approval regulations may have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval will be subject to a strict enforcement of post-marketing requirements and we could be subject to substantial penalties, including withdrawal of our product from the market, if we fail to comply with all regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, when and if any of them are approved.\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical trials, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other federal and state regulatory authorities. These requirements include, but are not limited to, restrictions governing promotion of an approved product, submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, and requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. The respective safety and efficacy profiles of our product candidates will continue to be closely monitored by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including Health Canada, if they are approved. If new safety information becomes available after approval of our product candidates, the FDA may require labeling changes or establishment of a REMS, and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including Health Canada, may require a similar strategy, impose significant restrictions on our product candidates\u2019 indicated uses or marketing, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance.\nThe FDA and other federal and state agencies, including the DOJ closely regulate compliance with all requirements governing prescription drug products, including requirements pertaining to marketing and promotion of drugs in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling and manufacturing of products in accordance with cGMP requirements. Violations of such requirements may lead to investigations alleging violations of the FDCA and other statutes, including the False Claims Act and other federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws as well as state consumer protection laws. In the United States, engaging in impermissible promotion of approved products for off-label uses can also subject us to false claims litigation under federal and state statutes, and other litigation and/or investigation, which can lead to civil and criminal penalties and fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which we promote or distribute our drug products. These false claims statutes include the federal civil False Claims Act, which allows any individual to bring a lawsuit against a pharmaceutical company on behalf of the federal government alleging submission of false or fraudulent claims, or causing to present such false or fraudulent claims, for payment by a federal program such as Medicare or Medicaid. If the government prevails in the lawsuit, the individual will share in any fines or settlement funds. These False Claims Act lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies have led to several substantial civil and criminal settlements. These lawsuits have increased the risk that a pharmaceutical company will have to defend a false claim action, pay settlement fines or restitution, agree to comply with burdensome reporting and compliance obligations, or may be excluded from the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. If we do not lawfully market our approved products, we may become subject to such litigation and/or investigation and, if we are not successful in defending against such actions, those actions could compromise our ability to become profitable. Our failure to comply with all regulatory requirements, and later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, may yield various results, including:\n\u2022\nlitigation involving patients taking our products;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on product distribution or use;\n\u2022\nrequirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwarning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u2022\nrecall of products;\n\u2022\nfines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u2022\ndamage to relationships with any potential collaborators;\n\u2022\nunfavorable press coverage and damage to our reputation;\n\u2022\nrefusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure or detention; or\n\u2022\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit or preclude our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenue.\nNon-compliance by us or any future collaborator with regulatory requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties.\nOur failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, and adversely impact our operating results.\nWe are subject to United States data protection laws and regulations (i.e., laws and regulations that address privacy and data security) at both the federal and state levels. The legislative and regulatory landscape for data protection continues to evolve, and in recent years there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data security issues. Numerous federal and state laws, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, and disclosure of health-related and other personal information. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties (e.g., healthcare providers who prescribe our products) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA-other than potentially with respect to providing certain employee benefits-we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. Finally, a data breach affecting sensitive personal information, including health information, could result in significant legal and financial exposure and reputational damages that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.\nE.U. Member States, Switzerland and other countries have also adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. For example, the collection and use of personal health data in the E.U. is governed by the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"). The GDPR imposes strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. In particular, these obligations and restrictions concern the legal basis for processing personal data, which may include consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals and the security and confidentiality of the personal data.\nThe GDPR prohibits the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the European Economic Area (\"EEA\") that are not considered by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of data protection. These countries include the United States. Transfer of personal data from the EEA to the United States is only permitted if there is an appropriate legal basis for the transfer of personal data, such as the existence of certain agreements in compliance with the model contractual clauses as issued by the European Commission, or if the recipient of the personal data in the United States is \"Privacy Shield\" certified, or if there is another appropriate legal basis i accordance with the GDPR for the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the United States.\nThe E.U. Data Protection Regulation has introduced new data protection requirements in the E.U. and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules.\nOur failure to comply with these laws, or changes in the way in which these laws are implemented, could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, and adversely impact our business.\nOur relationships with customers and third-party payors may be subject, directly or indirectly, to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, transparency, health information privacy and security, and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, we may be subject to transparency laws and patient privacy regulation by United States federal and state governments and by governments in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation or arranging of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022\nthe federal False Claims Act imposes criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government,\nwith potential liability including mandatory treble damages and significant per-claim penalties, set at $10,781 to $21,563 per false claim for violations occurring after November 2, 2015;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry relating to the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;\n\u2022\nthe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered products to report payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and their respective implementing regulations, which imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on covered healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and\n\u2022\nanalogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws and transparency statutes, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state laws that prohibit certain marketing-related activities, including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain health care providers, and restrict the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs; state laws that require identification or licensing of sales representatives; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy, security, collection, use and disclosure of health information, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, it may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from participation in government funded healthcare programs.\nCurrent and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of our product candidates, including Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, and affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could, among other things, prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability, or the ability of any collaborators, to profitably sell any products for which we, or they, obtain marketing approval. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we, or any collaborators, may receive for any approved products.\nIn the United States, the Medicare Modernization Act established the Medicare Part D program and generally authorized prescription drug plan sponsors to impose limits on the number of covered drugs under their plans in a therapeutic class. The Medicare Modernization Act, including its cost reduction initiatives, could decrease the coverage and reimbursement rate that we may receive for any of our product candidates, if approved. CMS, the agency that administers the Medicare program, also may revise reimbursement and implement coverage restrictions. Cost reduction initiatives and changes in coverage could decrease utilization of and reimbursement for any approved products, which would then affect the price we can receive. Private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement from federal legislation or regulation may lead to similar reductions in private payor reimbursement.\nIn addition, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the ACA. Among the provisions of the ACA of potential importance to our business and our product candidates are the following:\n\u2022\nan annual, non-deductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription products and biological products;\n\u2022\nan increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the MDRP to 23.1% for innovator drugs and 13% for non-innovator drugs of the AMP;\n\u2022\na new methodology by which AMP is calculated and reported by manufacturers for products that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected and not generally dispensed through retail community pharmacies;\n\u2022\nexpansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the civil False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022\na new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand products to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers\u2019 outpatient products to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u2022\nextension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability from fee-for-service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well;\n\u2022\nexpansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability;\n\u2022\nexpansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service's 340B drug pricing program;\n\u2022\nnew requirements to report to CMS annually specifying financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, as defined in the ACA and its implementing regulations, including reporting any \u2018\u2018payments or other transfers of value\u2019\u2019 made or distributed to prescribers, teaching hospitals, and other healthcare providers and reporting any ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations during the preceding calendar year;\n\u2022\na new requirement to annually report product samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;\n\u2022\na mandatory non-deductible payment for employers with 50 or more full-time employees (or equivalents) who fail to provide certain minimum health insurance coverage for such employees and their dependents;\n\u2022\nestablishment of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payments and service delivery models; and\n\u2022\na new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, led to aggregate reductions in Medicare payments for all items and services, including prescription drugs and biologics, to service providers of, on average, 2% per fiscal year beginning April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislation, will continue until 2029. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 also, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several categories of healthcare providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which regulatory approval is obtained, including Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial operations.\nAdditional legislative changes, FDA or CMS regulation, or guidance could be adopted, which may impact the marketing approvals and reimbursement for our product candidates. For example, there have been several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills and regulatory initiatives designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. In November 2015, the United States House of Representatives formed an Affordable Drug Pricing Task Force to advance legislation intended to control pharmaceutical drug costs and investigate pharmaceutical drug pricing, and the United States Senate has requested information from certain pharmaceutical companies in connection with an investigation into pharmaceutical drug pricing practices. If healthcare policies or reforms intended to curb healthcare costs are adopted or if we experience negative publicity with respect to pricing of our products or the pricing of pharmaceutical drugs generally, the prices that we charge for any approved products may be limited, our commercial opportunity may be limited and/or our revenues from sales of our products may be negatively impacted.\nCertain provisions of the ACA have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges, as well as efforts to repeal or replace them or to alter their interpretation or implementation. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 eliminated the tax-based shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Code, commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate,\u201d effective January 1, 2019. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 among other things, amended the Medicare statute, effective January 1, 2019, to reduce the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly known as the \u201cdonut hole,\u201d by raising the manufacturer discount under\nthe Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program to 70%. Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes and judicial challenges related to the ACA remain possible. It is unclear how the ACA and its implementation, as well as efforts to repeal or replace, or invalidate, the ACA, or portions thereof, will affect our business. It is possible that the ACA, as currently enacted or may be amended in the future, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, and new payment methodologies and in additional downward pressure on coverage and payment and the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products. Moreover, legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted in the United States or outside of the United States, or whether the FDA or CMS regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be.\nIf we participate in the MDRP and fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under that or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIf we participate in the MDRP, we will have certain price reporting obligations to the MDRP, and we may have obligations to report average sales price ASP figures to the Medicare program. Under the MDRP, we would be required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for our drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Those rebates would be based on pricing data reported by us on a monthly and quarterly basis to CMS. These data would include AMP and, in the case of innovator products, the best price for each drug which, in general, represents the lowest price available from the manufacturer to any entity in the United States in any pricing structure, calculated to include all sales and associated rebates, discounts and other price concessions.\nFederal law also requires that a company that participates in the MDRP report ASP information each quarter to CMS for certain categories of drugs that are paid under Part B of the Medicare program. Manufacturers calculate ASP based on a statutorily defined formula and interpretations of the statute by CMS. CMS uses these submissions to determine payment rates for drugs under Medicare Part B and the resulting Medicare payment rate.\nFederal law requires that any company that participates in the MDRP also participate in the Public Health Service\u2019s 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer\u2019s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B drug pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B \u201cceiling price\u201d for the manufacturer\u2019s covered outpatient drugs. The HRSA, which administers the 340B drug pricing program, issued a final regulation regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities, which became effective on January 1, 2019. HRSA also has implemented a ceiling price reporting requirement, pursuant to which manufacturers must report the 340B ceiling prices for their covered outpatient drugs to HRSA on a quarterly basis.\nIn addition, in order to be eligible to have its products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, a manufacturer also must participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs FSS pricing program, established by Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992. Under this program, the manufacturer is obligated to make its \u201ccovered drugs\u201d (biologics or innovator drugs) available for procurement on an FSS contract and charge a price to four federal agencies - Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense, Public Health Service and Coast Guard - that is no higher than the statutory federal ceiling price. The requirements under the 340B and FSS programs could reduce the revenue we may generate from any products that are commercialized in the future and could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nPricing and rebate calculations vary among products and programs. The calculations are complex and are often subject to interpretation by manufacturers, governmental or regulatory agencies, and the courts. The Medicaid rebate amount for each covered outpatient drug is computed each quarter based on the manufacturer\u2019s submission to CMS of its current AMP and, in the case of innovator products, best price figures, for the quarter. If we participate in the MDRP and become aware that our reporting for a prior quarter was incorrect, or has changed, we will be obligated to resubmit the corrected data for a period not to exceed twelve quarters from the quarter in which the data originally were due. Such restatements and recalculations would increase our costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing the MDRP. Any corrections to our rebate calculations could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the nature of the correction. Price recalculations also may affect the ceiling price at which we would be required to offer our products to certain covered entities, such as safety-net providers, under the 340B drug pricing program, and we may be obligated to issue refunds to covered entities.\nIf we participate in the MDRP or our products are covered under Medicare Part B, we will be liable for errors associated with our submission of pricing data. We cannot assure you that our submissions, if we participate in these programs, will not be found by CMS to be incomplete or incorrect. In addition to retroactive rebates and the potential for 340B program refunds, if we are found to have knowingly submitted false AMP, ASP or best price information to the government, we may be liable for civil monetary penalties per item of false information. If we are found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of our ASP, the Medicare statute provides for civil monetary penalties for each misrepresentation for each day in which the misrepresentation was applied. Civil monetary penalties also can be applied if we are found to have intentionally charged 340B covered entities more than the statutorily mandated ceiling price. Our failure to submit monthly/quarterly AMP, ASP and best price data on a timely basis could result in a civil monetary penalty per day for each day the information is late beyond the due date. Such failure also could be grounds for CMS to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, pursuant to which we would participate in the Medicaid program. In the event that CMS terminates our rebate agreement, federal payments may not be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs that we are able to successfully commercialize.\nLaws and regulations governing any international operations we may have in the future may preclude us from developing, manufacturing and selling certain products outside of the United States and require us to develop and implement costly compliance programs.\nIf we expand our operations outside of the United States, we must dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate. The FCPA prohibits any United States individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.\nCompliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.\nVarious laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain non-United States nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence outside of the United States, it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.\nThe failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting. The SEC also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on United States exchanges for violations of the FCPA\u2019s accounting provisions.\nThe consequences of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the E.U. may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.\nIn June 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom elected to withdraw from the E.U. in a national referendum. In March 2017, the government of the United Kingdom formally initiated the withdrawal procedure. The United Kingdom left the E.U. on January 31, 2020 and is no longer an E.U. Member State. The United Kingdom and the E.U. have reached an agreement which will govern the United Kingdom's relationship with the E.U. until the end of 2020. It is uncertain low the legal relationship between the United Kingdom and the E.U. will be governed after 2020. The legal frameworks and regulatory requirements applicable to medicinal products may diverge and separate marketing authorizations and other regulatory approvals may be required to place medicinal products on the market and to manufacture, distribute, import and export medicinal products in the United Kingdom and in the E.U. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. Any of these factors could significantly increase the complexity of our activities in the E.U. and in the United Kingdom, could depress our economic activity and restrict our access to capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and reduce the price of our securities.\nIf we or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur significant costs.\nWe and our third-party manufacturers are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nFurther, with respect to the operations of our third-party contract manufacturers, it is possible that if they fail to operate in compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or properly dispose of wastes associated with our products, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, suffer reputational harm or experience a disruption in the manufacture and supply of our product candidates or products.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could cause significant liability for us and harm our reputation.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct, including intentional failure to comply with FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable non-United States regulatory authorities, including Health Canada, failure to provide accurate information to the FDA or comparable non-United States regulatory authorities, including Health Canada or the competent authorities of the E.U. Member States, failure to comply with manufacturing standards we have established, failure to comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable non-United States regulatory authorities, and failure to report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws, standards or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nOur future success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nOur future growth and success depend on our ability to recruit, retain, manage and motivate our employees. The loss of any member of our senior management team or the inability to hire or retain experienced management personnel could compromise our ability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results. Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success. The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities\nthat may limit their availability to us. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be limited.\nWe will need to grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had 25 full-time employees and no part-time employees, ten hold Ph.D. degrees and one is a veterinary doctor. This number consists of eight employees engaged in administration, five employees engaged in clinical and regulatory activities, five employees engaged in research and development, five employees engaged in operations (three in manufacturing and two in facility/engineering) and two employees engaged in quality and support. Two of our employees are located in our corporate headquarters in Boston, twelve of our employees are located in our Winnipeg facility, and eleven of our employees are located in our Philadelphia office. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, or as a result of any future acquisitions, we will need additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other resources. Our management, personnel and systems that are currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including:\n\u2022\nmanaging our clinical trials effectively;\n\u2022\nidentifying, recruiting, maintaining, motivating and integrating additional employees;\n\u2022\nmanaging our internal development efforts effectively while complying with our contractual obligations to licensors, licensees, contractors and other third parties;\n\u2022\nimproving our managerial, development, operational and finance systems; and\n\u2022\nexpanding our facilities.\nAs our operations expand, we will need to manage additional relationships with various strategic partners, suppliers and other third parties. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize Vicinium, if approved, and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth. To that end, we must be able to effectively manage our development efforts and clinical trials and hire, train and integrate additional management, administrative and sales and marketing personnel. Our failure to accomplish any of these tasks could prevent us from successfully growing our company.\nWe may acquire other assets or businesses, or form collaborations or make investments in other companies or technologies that could harm our operating results, dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership, incur debt or cause us to incur significant expense.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of assets or businesses, or strategic alliances and collaborations, to expand our existing technologies and operations. We may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction, any of which could have a detrimental effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and if we make any acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into our existing business. We may incur debt or assume unknown or contingent liabilities in connection therewith. Integration of an acquired company or assets may also disrupt ongoing operations, require the hiring of additional personnel and the implementation of additional internal systems and infrastructure, especially the acquisition of commercial assets, and require management resources that would otherwise focus on developing our existing business. We may not be able to find suitable collaboration partners or identify other investment opportunities, and we may experience losses related to any such investments.\nTo finance any acquisitions or collaborations, we may choose to issue debt or shares of our common stock as consideration. Any such issuance of shares would dilute the ownership of our stockholders. If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other assets or companies or fund a transaction using our stock as consideration. Alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional capital for acquisitions through public or private financings. Additional capital may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\nIf we expand our development and regulatory capabilities or implement sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nTo manage future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources and the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with such growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nWe rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cyber security incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of third parties with which we contract are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. System failures, accidents or security breaches could cause interruptions in our operations and could result in a material disruption of our clinical and commercialization activities and business operations, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. The loss of clinical trial data could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and our product research, development and commercialization efforts could be delayed.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \"Certificate of Incorporation\") and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors such that only one of three classes of directors is elected each year;\n\u2022\nallow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nlimit the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from our board of directors;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our board of directors;\n\u2022\nrequire that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u2022\nlimit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal specified provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\"DGCL\"), which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nIf we are unable to regain compliance with the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Global Market, our common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and could make it more difficult for you to sell your shares.\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market, and we are therefore subject to its continued listing requirements, including requirements with respect to the market value of publicly-held shares, market value of listed shares, minimum bid price per share, and minimum stockholders' equity, among others, and requirements relating to board and committee independence. If we fail to satisfy one or more of the requirements, we may be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market.\nOn March 2, 2020, we received notice (the \"Notice\") from the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\"Nasdaq\") that we are not currently in compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1). The Notice indicated that, consistent with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have until August 31, 2020 to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement by having the closing bid price of our common stock meet or exceed $1.00 per share for at least ten consecutive business days. The notification had no immediate effect on the\nlisting of our common stock, and our common stock will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol \u201cSESN\u201d at this time.\nIf we do not regain compliance by August 31, 2020, we may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day grace period if we meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares ($1.0 million) and all other Nasdaq initial listing standards which require, among other things, that we have at least $5.0 million of stockholders\u2019 equity or at least $4.0 million of stockholders\u2019 equity and $50.0 million market value of listed shares. If we fail to regain compliance during the applicable period, we will receive notification from Nasdaq that our common stock is subject to delisting. At that time, we may then appeal the delisting determination to a Hearings Panel. Such notification will have no immediate effect on our listing on the Nasdaq Global Market, nor will it have an immediate effect on the trading of our common stock pending such hearing. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to regain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s minimum bid price requirement. If we regain compliance with the Nasdaq\u2019s minimum bid price requirement, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements for the Nasdaq Global Market or that our common stock will not be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market in the future. In addition, we may be unable to meet other applicable listing requirements of the Nasdaq Global Market, including maintaining minimum levels of stockholders\u2019 equity or market values of our common stock in which case, our common stock could be delisted notwithstanding our ability to demonstrate compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.\nDelisting from the Nasdaq Global Market may adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities, may significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and may negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. Delisting also could have other negative results, including the potential loss of employee confidence, the loss of institutional investors or interest in business development opportunities.\nIf we are delisted from Nasdaq and we are not able to list our common stock on another exchange, our common stock could be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or in the \u201cpink sheets.\u201d As a result, we could face significant adverse consequences including, among others:\n\u2022\na limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u2022\na determination that our common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\u2022\na limited amount of news and little or no analyst coverage for us;\n\u2022\nwe would no longer qualify for exemptions from state securities registration requirements, which may require us to comply with applicable state securities laws; and\n\u2022\na decreased ability to issue additional securities (including pursuant to short-form Registration Statements on Form S-3) or obtain additional financing in the future.\nIf our common stock becomes subject to the penny stock rules, it would become more difficult to trade our shares.\nThe SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or authorized for quotation on certain automated quotation systems, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. If we do not retain our listing on the Nasdaq Global Market and if the price of our common stock is less than $5.00, our common stock may be deemed a penny stock. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document containing specified information. In addition, the penny stock rules require that before effecting any transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive (i) the purchaser\u2019s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement; (ii) a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks; and (iii) a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock, and therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling their shares.\nThe price of our common stock has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future, which could result in substantial losses for our stockholders.\nThe price of our common stock is highly volatile and may be affected by developments directly affecting our business, as well as by developments out of our control or not specific to us. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, in particular, and the stock market generally, are vulnerable to abrupt changes in investor sentiment. Prices of securities and trading volumes of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including ours, can swing dramatically in ways unrelated to, or that bear a disproportionate relationship to, our performance. The price of our common stock and their trading volumes may fluctuate based on a number of factors including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u2022\nresults of clinical trials of Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC or any other product candidate that we may develop;\n\u2022\nour ability to complete the BLA submission for Vicinium, whether or not the FDA will accept such submission and whether or not the FDA will approve Vicinium for marketing;\n\u2022\nif approved, the success of commercialization of Vicinium;\n\u2022\nresults of clinical trials of, or regulatory approvals for, product candidates of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe success of commercialization of our competitors;\n\u2022\nregulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nthe recruitment or departure of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u2022\nthe level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs;\n\u2022\nthe results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire or in-license additional products, product candidates or technologies, the costs of commercializing any such products and the costs of development of any such product candidates or technologies;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u2022\nthe other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company. We also may face securities class action litigation if we cannot obtain regulatory approvals for or if we otherwise fail to commercialize Vicinium for the treatment of high-risk NMIBC or any of our other product candidates. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could cause us to incur substantial costs to defend such claims and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares are eligible to be sold into the market, which could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nAs of February 29, 2020, we had outstanding 109,988,768 shares of common stock. Of these shares, 4,058,596 shares are restricted securities under Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (\"Securities Act\"). Any of our remaining shares that are not restricted securities under Rule 144 under the Securities Act may be resold in the public market without restriction unless purchased by our affiliates.\nMoreover, a holder of 3,582,328 shares of our common stock issued in connection with the acquisition of Viventia has the right, subject to specified conditions, to require us to file a registration statement covering such shares or to include such shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. We have filed registration statements on April 9, 2014, March 12, 2015, March 31, 2016, May 5, 2017, May 16, 2018 (as amended on August 10, 2018), May 21, 2019 and November 14, 2019 registering all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans or outside of our equity compensation plans pursuant to inducement equity awards.\nAs of February 29, 2020, we had outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 9,468,484 shares of our common stock with a weighted-average exercise price of $1.30, of which options to purchase 2,245,002 shares were vested; warrants to purchase 20,410,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.47 per share; warrants to purchase 1,943,017 share of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.95 per share; warrants to purchase 486,687 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.55 per share; warrants to purchase 27,500 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $11.83 per share; and warrants to purchase 27,500 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $11.04 per share.\nShares issuable upon exercise of these options and warrants can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to volume, notice and manner of sale limitations applicable to affiliates.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had United States federal net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards of $160.1 million, state NOL carryforwards of $131.2 million and United States federal and state research and development credit (\"R&D credit\")\ncarryforwards of $2.2 million and $0.9 million, respectively. $118.9 million of the United States federal NOL carryforwards and $131.2 million of the state NOL carryforwards expire beginning 2030 through 2039. $41.2 million of the United States federal NOL carryforwards will be carried forward indefinitely. The United States federal and state R&D credit carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in 2027 through 2039, if not utilized. Utilization of these NOL and R&D credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial limitation under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code and comparable provisions of state, local and foreign tax laws due to changes in ownership of our company that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. Under Section 382 of the Code and comparable provisions of state, local and foreign tax laws, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change by value in its equity ownership over a three year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research and development tax credits, to reduce its post-change income may be limited. We have determined that it is more likely than not that our NOL and R&D credit carryforward amounts disclosed are subject to a material limitation under Section 382. We may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we generate taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOL and R&D credit carryforwards to reduce United States federal and state taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could result in increased future tax liability to us.\nWe may record impairment charges, which would adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.\nWe have recorded a material amount of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet in connection with our acquisition of Viventia. We review our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other.\nOne potential indicator of goodwill impairment is whether the fair value of our equity, as measured by our market capitalization, is below the net book value of our equity. Whether our market capitalization triggers an impairment charge in any future period will depend on the underlying reasons for the decline in stock price, the significance of the decline and the length of time the stock price has been trading at such prices.\nIn addition, the determination as to whether our indefinite-lived intangible assets related to Vicinium rights are impaired is heavily dependent on the results of our ongoing clinical trial, as well as other factors, such as the potential market for Vicinium, if approved.\nIn the event that we determine in a future period that impairment exists for any reason, we would record an impairment charge, which could be material and which would reduce the underlying asset\u2019s value in the period such determination is made, which would adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.\nWe incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management now is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices.\nAs a public company, and particularly now that we are no longer an emerging growth company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Global Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, which in turn could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors.\nWe cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. These rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.\nWe are no longer an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 and, as a result, can no longer rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements which are available to emerging growth companies. Among other things, we are now required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\"SOX 404(b)\").\nWe were previously required to furnish only a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. We are now required to also include, beginning with this Annual Report on Form 10-K and included elsewhere herein, an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with SOX 404(b), we completed a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which was both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially\nengage outside consultants and adopt detailed work plans to continue to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nWe are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements or insufficient disclosures due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be our stockholders\u2019 sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid, and for the foreseeable future do not expect to declare or pay, cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be our stockholders\u2019 sole source of gain.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for shares of our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. Although we have obtained analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade shares of our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 14452, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "SESN"}
