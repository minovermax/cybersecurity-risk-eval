{"cik": "932021", "company": "GLOBAL TECHNOLOGIES LTD", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-12-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below and other information in this prospectus, including the financial statements and related notes that appear at the end of this prospectus, before deciding to invest in our securities. These risks should be considered in conjunction with any other information included herein, including in conjunction with forward-looking statements made herein. If any of the following risks actually occur, they could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or prospects. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nRisks Relating to Our Company\nWe have incurred significant losses and anticipate future losses.\nAs of June 30, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $160,937,361 and a stockholders\u2019 deficit of approximately $1,489,010.\nFuture losses are likely to occur as, until we are able to merge with another entity with experienced management and opportunities for growth in return for shares of our common stock to create value for our shareholders as we have no sources of income to meet our operating expenses. As a result of these, among other factors, we received from our registered independent public accountants in their report for the financial statements for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, an explanatory paragraph stating that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur existing financial resources are insufficient to meet our ongoing operating expenses.\nWe have no sources of income at this time and no existing cash balances to meet our ongoing operating expenses. In the short term, unless we are able to raise additional debt and/or equity we shall be unable to meet our ongoing operating expenses. On a longer-term basis, we intend to raise the debt and/or equity to meet our ongoing operating expenses and merge with another entity with experienced management and opportunities for growth in return for shares of our common stock to create value for our shareholders. There can be no assurance that this series of events will be successfully completed.\nScarcity of, and competition for, business opportunities and combinations.\nWe believe we are an insignificant participant among the firms which engage in the acquisition of business opportunities. There are many established venture capital and financial concerns that have significantly greater financial and personnel resources and technical expertise than we have. Nearly all such entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than us and, consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. Moreover, we will also compete in seeking merger or acquisition candidates with numerous other small public companies. In view of our limited financial resources and limited management availability, we will continue to be at a significant competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.\nWe may be negatively affected by adverse general economic conditions.\nCurrent conditions in domestic and global economies are extremely uncertain. Adverse changes may occur as a result of softening global economies, wavering consumer confidence caused by the threat of terrorism and war, and other factors capable of affecting economic conditions. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nBecause our principal shareholder controls our activities, he may cause us to act in a manner that is most beneficial to himself and not to other shareholders which could cause us not to take actions that outside investors might view favorably.\nOur principal shareholder, our sole officer and director, has voting authority for ninety six percent (96%) of our outstanding common stock. As a result, he effectively controls all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers and related party transaction. These insiders also have the ability to delay or perhaps even block, by their ownership of our stock, an unsolicited tender offer. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of our company that you might view favorably.\nOur director may have conflicts of interest which may not be resolved favorably to us.\nCertain conflicts of interest may exist between our sole director and us. Our sole Director has other business interests to which he devotes his attention and may be expected to continue to do so although management time should be devoted to our business. As a result, conflicts of interest may arise that can be resolved only through exercise of such judgment as is consistent with fiduciary duties to us. See \u201cDirectors and Executive Officers\u201d (page 30 below), and \u201cConflicts of Interest.\u201d (page 31 below).\nWe may depend upon outside advisors; who may not be available on reasonable terms and as needed.\nTo supplement the business experience of our officers and directors, we may be required to employ accountants, technical experts, appraisers, attorneys, or other consultants or advisors. Our Board without any input from stockholders will make the selection of any such advisors. Furthermore, it is anticipated that such persons may be engaged on an \u201cas needed\u201d basis without a continuing fiduciary or other obligation to us. In the event we consider it necessary to hire outside advisors, we may elect to hire persons who are affiliates, if they are able to provide the required services.\nWe may not be able to meet the filing and internal control reporting requirements imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which may result in a decline in the price of our common shares and an inability to obtain future financing.\nAs directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as amended by SEC Release No. 33-8934 on June 26, 2008, the SEC adopted rules requiring each public company to include a report of management on the company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting in its annual reports. In addition, the independent registered public accounting firm auditing a company\u2019s financial statements may have to also attest to and report on management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of the company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting. We may be required to include a report of management on its internal control over financial reporting. The internal control report must include a statement\n\u25cf Of management\u2019s responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over its financial reporting;\n\u25cf Of management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of year-end; and\n\u25cf Of the framework used by management to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nFurthermore, our independent registered public accounting firm may be required to file its attestation on whether it believes that we have maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting.\nWhile we expect to expend significant resources in developing the necessary documentation and testing procedures required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, there is a risk that we may not be able to comply timely with all of the requirements imposed by this rule. In the event that we are unable to receive a positive attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm with respect to our internal controls, investors and others may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and our stock price and ability to obtain equity or debt financing as needed could suffer.\nIn addition, in the event that our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to rely on our internal controls in connection with its audit of our financial statements, and in the further event that it is unable to devise alternative procedures in order to satisfy itself as to the material accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures, it is possible that we would be unable to file our Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC, which could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to secure additional financing as needed.\nReporting requirements under the Exchange Act and compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including establishing and maintaining acceptable internal controls over financial reporting, are costly and may increase substantially.\nThe rules and regulations of the SEC require a public company to prepare and file periodic reports under the Exchange Act, which will require that the Company engage legal, accounting, auditing and other professional services. The engagement of such services is costly. Additionally, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) requires, among other things, that we design, implement and maintain adequate internal controls and procedures over financial reporting. The costs of complying with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the limited technically qualified personnel we have may make it difficult for us to design, implement and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting. In the event that we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may not be able to produce reliable financial reports or report fraud, which may harm our overall financial condition and result in loss of investor confidence and a decline in our share price.\nAs a public company, we will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Despite recent reforms made possible by the JOBS Act, compliance with these rules and regulations will nonetheless increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and operating results.\nWe are working with our legal, accounting and financial advisors to identify those areas in which changes should be made to our financial and management control systems to manage our growth and our obligations as a public company. These areas include corporate governance, corporate control, disclosure controls and procedures and financial reporting and accounting systems. We have made, and will continue to make, changes in these and other areas. However, we anticipate that the expenses that will be required in order to adequately prepare for being a public company could be material. We estimate that the aggregate cost of increased legal services; accounting and audit functions; personnel, such as a chief financial officer familiar with the obligations of public company reporting; consultants to design and implement internal controls; and financial printing alone will be a few hundred thousand dollars per year and could be several hundred thousand dollars per year. In addition, if and when we retain independent directors and/or additional members of senior management, we may incur additional expenses related to director compensation and/or premiums for directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, the costs of which we cannot estimate at this time. We may also incur additional expenses associated with investor relations and similar functions, the cost of which we also cannot estimate at this time. However, these additional expenses individually, or in the aggregate, may also be material.\nIn addition, being a public company could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nThe increased costs associated with operating as a public company may decrease our net income or increase our net loss and may cause us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our products or services to offset the effect of such increased costs. Additionally, if these requirements divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have material weakness in our controls and procedures.\nWe have conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in \u201cInternal Control Integrated Framework\u201d issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations for the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d) and published in 2013, and subsequent guidance prepared by COSO specifically for smaller public companies. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June 30, 2020 and 2019 for the reasons discussed below:\nA significant deficiency is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, that adversely affects the entity\u2019s ability to initiate, authorize, record, process, or report financial data reliably in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of the entity\u2019s financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected by the entity\u2019s internal control.\nA material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nManagement identified the following material weakness and significant deficiencies in its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020:\n\u25cf The Company did not maintain effective controls over certain aspects of the financial reporting process because we lacked personnel with accounting expertise and an adequate supervisory review structure that is commensurate with our financial reporting requirements.\n\u25cf Material Weakness - Inadequate segregation of duties.\nThe management of the Company believes that these material weaknesses will remain until such time that the Company has the resources to increase the number of personnel committed to the performance of its financial duties that such weaknesses can be specifically addressed. This will include, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf Hiring of additional personnel to adequately segregate financial reporting duties.\n\u25cf The retention of outside consultants to review our controls and procedures\nGeneral Business Risks\nConflicts of interest may arise from other business activities of our directors and officers.\nOur sole officer and director, Jimmy Wayne Anderson, currently serves in the role as President and Chairman of another publicly traded entity, Sylios Corp (a fully-reporting company \u201cUNGS\u201d on the OTC Markets \u201cPINK\u201d). Mr. Anderson also serves as the President and Chairman of AMDAQ Corp, a spin-off of Sylios Corp. As such, Mr. Anderson may not be able to dedicate the required time to the Company to further its operations.\nWe are highly dependent on the services of key executives, the loss of whom could materially harm our business and our strategic direction. If we lose key management or significant personnel, cannot recruit qualified employees, directors, officers, or other personnel or experience increases in our compensation costs, our business may materially suffer.\nWe are highly dependent on our management team, specifically Jimmy Wayne Anderson, who we currently anticipate will be able to devote 10-15 hours per week to the Company\u2019s operations. If we lose key employees, our business may suffer. Furthermore, our future success will also depend in part on the continued service of our management personnel and our ability to identify, hire, and retain additional key personnel. We do not carry \u201ckey-man\u201d life insurance on the lives of any of our executives, employees or advisors. We experience intense competition for qualified personnel and may be unable to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development of our business. Because of this competition, our compensation costs may increase significantly.\nWe will need to raise additional capital to continue operations over the coming year.\nWe anticipate the need to raise approximately $1,000,000 in capital to fund our operations through December 31, 2021. We expect to use these cash proceeds, primarily to identify new business opportunities and possible acquisitions. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to raise these required funds or generate sufficient revenue to remain operational.\nWe may be unable to manage growth, which may impact our potential profitability.\nSuccessful implementation of our business strategy requires us to manage our growth. Growth could place an increasing strain on our management and financial resources. To manage growth effectively, we will need to:\n\u25cf Establish definitive business strategies, goals and objectives;\n\u25cf Maintain a system of management controls; and\n\u25cf Attract and retain qualified personnel, as well as, develop, train and manage management-level and other employees.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed, and our stock price may decline.\nOur lack of adequate D&O insurance may also make it difficult for us to retain and attract talented and skilled directors and officers.\nWe may in the future be subject to additional litigation, including potential class action and stockholder derivative actions. Risks associated with legal liability are difficult to assess and quantify, and their existence and magnitude can remain unknown for significant periods of time. To date, we have not obtained directors and officers liability (\u201cD&O\u201d) insurance. While neither Delaware law nor our Articles of Incorporation or bylaws require us to indemnify or advance expenses to our officers and directors involved in such a legal action, we have entered into an indemnification agreement with our President and intend to enter into similar agreements with other officers and directors in the future. Without adequate D&O insurance, the amounts we would pay to indemnify our officers and directors should they be subject to legal action based on their service to the Company could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Furthermore, our lack of adequate D&O insurance may make it difficult for us to retain and attract talented and skilled directors and officers, which could adversely affect our business.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting, the reputational effects could materially adversely affect our business.\nUnder the provisions of Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended by the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to perform an evaluation of Internal Control over Financial Reporting (Internal Controls) and to report on our evaluation in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our Internal Controls constitute a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In the event we discover material weakness in our internal controls and our remediation of such reported material weakness is ineffective, or if in the future we are unable to maintain effective Internal Controls, additional resulting material restatements could occur, regulatory actions could be taken, and a resulting loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements could occur.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses to meet our reporting obligations as a public company. In addition, failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in our financial reporting and could harm our ability to manage our expenses.\nWe estimate that it will cost approximately $50,000 annually to maintain the proper management and financial controls for our filings required as a public reporting company. In addition, if we do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis, which could cause a decline in our stock price and adversely affect our ability to raise capital.\nIf the registration of our common stock is revoked in the future, our business opportunities will cease to exist.\nIn the event our securities registration was to be revoked, we would not have the ability to raise money through the issuance of shares and would lose the ability to continue the business plan set out in this filing. Common stock issued and outstanding at that time would no longer be tradable.\nOur business operations have been and may continue to be materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of the novel respiratory illness coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d).\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the novel respiratory illness COVID-19 a pandemic. The new strain of COVID-19 is considered to be highly contagious and poses a serious public health threat.\nAny outbreak of such epidemic illness or other adverse public health developments may materially and adversely affect the global economy, our markets and our business.\nWe cannot foresee whether the outbreak of COVID-19 will be effectively contained, nor can we predict the severity and duration of its impact. If the outbreak of COVID-19 is not effectively and timely controlled, our business operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected as a result of the deteriorating market outlook for retail and online sales, the slowdown in regional and national economic growth, weakened liquidity and financial condition of our customers or other factors that we cannot foresee. Any of these factors and other factors beyond our control could have an adverse effect on the overall business environment, cause uncertainties in the regions where we conduct business, cause our business to suffer in ways that we cannot predict and materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carry-forwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nWe have incurred substantial losses during our history. To the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses, unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carry-forwards, or NOLs, and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carry-forwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\nRisks Associated with Our Subsidiary, HMNRTH, LLC\nAll strains of cannabis other than hemp remain illegal under Federal law.\nDespite the development of a legal cannabis industry under the laws of certain states and the legalization of hemp under the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, the state laws legalizing medical and adult cannabis use are in conflict with the Federal Controlled Substances Act, which classifies cannabis as a \u201cSchedule-I\u201d controlled substance and makes cannabis use and possession illegal on a national level. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that the Federal government has the right to regulate and criminalize cannabis, even for medical purposes, and thus Federal law criminalizing the use of cannabis preempts state laws that legalize its use. However, the Obama Administration determined that it is not an efficient use of resources to direct Federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state laws allowing the use and distribution of medical and recreational cannabis. There is no guarantee that the current or any future Administration will not change the Federal government\u2019s stated policy regarding the low-priority enforcement of Federal laws in states where cannabis has been legalized. Any such change in the Federal government\u2019s enforcement of Federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us and our shareholders.\nWe recently entered the CBD Market and as a result, we are subject to numerous potential regulatory matters, which could negatively impact our operations.\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) which enforces the controlled substances laws of the United States has issued various rules and announcements concerning various items considered to be marijuana extracts which may encompass Cannabinoids. The uncertainty involves the extent to which the DEA will try to restrict the marketing or distribution of hemp finished/CBD products which we manufacture and distribute. If the DEA or other government agency were to take any action concerning our CBD products, it would have a negative impact on our revenues and financial condition.\nBecause we are subject to numerous laws and regulations, we could incur substantial costs.\nThe manufacture, labeling and distribution of our products is regulated by various federal, state and local agencies. These governmental authorities may commence regulatory or legal proceedings, which could restrict the permissible scope of our product claims or the ability to sell our products in the future. The FDA regulates our nutraceutical and wellness products to ensure that the products are not adulterated or misbranded.\nWe are subject to additional regulation as a result of our CBD products. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that we may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nFailure to comply with FDA requirements may result in, among other things, injunctions, product withdrawals, recalls, product seizures, fines and criminal prosecutions. Our advertising is subject to regulation by the FTC under the FTCA. Additionally, some states also permit advertising and labeling laws to be enforced by private attorney generals, who may seek relief for consumers, seek class action certifications, seek class wide damages and product recalls of products sold by us. Any actions against us by governmental authorities or private litigants could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLaws and regulations affecting the medical marijuana industry are constantly changing, which could detrimentally affect our proposed operations.\nLocal, state and federal medical marijuana laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter our business plan. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, it is possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our proposed business. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on our business.\nUntil we have developed and launched our products at commercial levels, there is uncertainty of market acceptance and the efficacy of the commercialization strategy.\nWhile we have launched the sale of our CBD products on our ecommerce website, natural, hemp-based consumer products are new to the marketplace and it is not yet determined whether such products will gain consumer acceptance. Until we have consistent, proven sales, there is uncertainty of product acceptance in the intended markets and our ability to commercialize our products. As with any transformational product, there will be a time before customers embrace the product and recognize its full value. If there are no, or only low levels of, product acceptance and sales, we may have to alter our business plan. As is typical of any new business concept, demand and market acceptance for newly introduced products and services is subject to great uncertainty. Achieving market acceptance will require us to undertake substantial marketing efforts and to make significant expenditures to create awareness of and demand for our products. We have limited marketing experience and limited financial, personnel and other resources to undertake extensive marketing activities. Our efforts will be subject to all of the risks associated with the commercialization of new products, including unanticipated delays, expenses and the evolution of industry standards. There can be no assurance that markets for our products will not be limited, or that our strategies will result in successful product commercialization or in initial or continued market acceptance for our products.\nDue to controversy over the cannabis plant within the United States, we face challenges getting our products into stores.\nSome of our products are intended for ingestion purposes. There are potential significant health benefits to consuming hemp-based products, however, all products derived from the cannabis plant are controversial. Our products contain only trace amounts of THC and are below the legal limit for ingestion within the U.S. However, we anticipate that we may face scrutiny and experience resistance in getting our products into stores due to hesitation by food chains to carry any product even affiliated with the cannabis plant.\nWe face substantial risk of product liability claims and potential adverse product publicity.\nLike any other retailer, distributor or manufacturer of products that are designed to be ingested, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in injury. In the event we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification, product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company is not currently a named defendant in any product liability lawsuit; however, other manufacturers and distributors of nutritional supplements currently are or have been named as defendants in such lawsuits. The successful assertion or settlement of any uninsured claim, a significant number of insured claims, or a claim exceeding the Company\u2019s insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nGovernment regulation of cannabis and hemp is constantly evolving, and unfavorable developments could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nAny changes in laws or regulations relating to cannabis and hemp could adversely affect our business, results of operations and our business prospects.\nRisks Associated with Our Subsidiary, Markets on Main, LLC\nAn inability to develop and introduce products in a timely and cost-effective manner may damage our business.\nOur sales and profitability depend on our ability to bring products to market to meet customer demands and before consumers begin to lose interest in a given property. There is no guarantee that we will be able to manufacture, source and ship new or continuing products in a timely manner and on a cost-effective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands. This risk is heightened by our customers\u2019 increasingly compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business. Moreover, unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process, significant increases in the planned cost of development, manufacturing delays or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products and new brands may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated, may reduce or eliminate the profitability of such products or, in some situations, may cause a product or new brand introduction to be discontinued.\nOur success will depend on the reliability and performance of third-party distributors, manufacturers and suppliers.\nWe compete with other companies for the production capacity of third-party suppliers for components. Certain of these competing companies have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have, and we may be at a competitive disadvantage in seeking to procure production capacity. Our inability to contract with third-party manufacturers and suppliers to provide a sufficient supply of our products on acceptable terms and on a timely basis could negatively impact our relationships with existing customers and cause us to lose revenue-generating opportunities with potential customers. We also rely on operators and distributors to market and distribute our products. If our operators or distributors are unsuccessful, we may miss revenue-generating opportunities that might otherwise have been recognized.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology, and potential cyberattacks, security problems or other disruption and expanding social media vehicles present new risks.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, billing and operating data. We may purchase some of our information technology from vendors, on whom our systems will depend, and we rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential operator and other customer information. We depend upon the secure transmission of this information over public networks. Our networks and storage applications could be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or others through cyberattacks, which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, or by other means, or may be breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. In some cases, it will be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage they cause. Any significant breakdown, invasion, destruction, interruption or leakage of information from our systems could harm our reputation and business.\nIn addition, the use of social media could cause us to suffer brand damage or information leakage. Negative posts or comments about us on any social networking website could damage our or our brands\u2019 reputations. Employees or others might disclose non-public sensitive information relating to our business through external media channels, including through the use of social media. The continuing evolution of social media will present us with new challenges and risks.\nDefects in products we develop internally or for clients could reduce our revenue, increase our costs, burden our engineering and marketing resources, involve us in litigation and adversely affect us.\nOur success will depend on our ability to avoid, detect and correct defects in our products. We may not be able to maintain products that are free from defects. Although we have taken steps to prevent defects, our products could suffer such defects. The occurrence of such defects or malfunctions could result in physical harm to the patrons of our customers and the subsequent termination of agreements, cancellation of orders, product returns and diversion of our resources. Even if our customers do not suffer financial losses, customers may replace our products if they do not perform according to expectations. Any of these occurrences could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and/or loss of sales. In addition, the occurrence of defects in our products may give rise to claims for lost revenues and related litigation by our customers and may subject us to investigation or other disciplinary action by regulatory authorities that could include suspension or revocation of our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to successfully manage our future inventories.\nWe must maintain sufficient inventory levels to operate our business successfully, but we must also avoid accumulating excess inventory, which increases working capital needs and lowers gross margin. We must typically order our CBD products well in advance of the time these products will be offered for sale to our customers. As a result, it may be difficult to respond to changes in consumer preferences and market conditions, which, for pop culture products, can change rapidly. If we do not accurately anticipate the popularity of certain products, then we may not have sufficient inventory to meet demand. Alternatively, if demand or future sales do not reach forecasted levels, we could have excess inventory that we may need to hold for a long period of time, write down, sell at prices lower than expected or discard. If we are not successful in managing our inventory, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may also be negatively affected by changes in retailers\u2019 inventory policies and practices. As a result of the desire of retailers to more closely manage inventory levels, there is a growing trend to make purchases on a \u201cjust-in-time\u201d basis. This requires us to more closely anticipate demand and could require us to carry additional inventory. Policies and practices of individual retailers may adversely affect us as well, including those relating to access to and time on shelf space, price demands, payment terms and favoring the products of our competitors. Our retail customers make no binding long-term commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering purchase orders. Any retailer can therefore freely reduce its overall purchase of our products, including the number and variety of our products that it carries, and reduce the shelf space allotted for our products. If demand or future sales do not reach forecasted levels, we could have excess inventory that we may need to hold for a long period of time, write down, sell at prices lower than expected or discard. If we are not successful in managing our inventory, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAn inability to develop and introduce products in a timely and cost-effective manner may damage our business.\nOur sales and profitability for our CBD products depend on our ability to bring products to market to meet customer demands before consumers begin to lose interest in a given property. There is no guarantee that we will be able to source our manufacturing and ship new or continuing products in a timely manner or on a cost-effective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands. This risk is heightened by our customers\u2019 increasingly compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business. These time constraints may lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order to minimize their inventory risk. Moreover, unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process, significant increases in the planned cost of development, manufacturing or distribution delays or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products and new brands, or the related third party content, may cause the introduction date for new CBD products to be later than anticipated, may reduce or eliminate the profitability of such products or, in some situations, may cause a product or new brand introduction to be discontinued.\nRisk to Our Common Stock\nIf we fail to remain current on our reporting requirements, we could be removed from the OTC Bulletin Board which would limit the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities in the secondary market.\nCompanies trading on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board must be reporting issuers under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and must be current in their reports under Section 13, in order to maintain price quotation privileges on the OTC Bulletin Board. As a result, the market liquidity for our securities could be severely adversely affected by limiting the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the secondary market. In addition, we may be unable to get relisted on the OTC Bulletin Board, which may have an adverse material effect on the Company.\nRestrictions on the Use of Rule 144 by Shell Companies or Former Shell Companies\nRule 144 is not available for the resale of securities initially issued by shell companies (other than business combination related shell companies) or issuers that have been at any time previously a shell company. However, Rule 144 also includes an important exception to this prohibition if the following conditions are met:\n\u25cf the issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased to be a shell company;\n\u25cf the issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act;\n\u25cf the issuer of the securities has filed all Exchange Act reports and materials required to be filed, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than Current Reports on Form 8-K; and\n\u25cf at least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed current Form 10 type information with the SEC reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company.\nAt the present time, the Company is classified as a \u201cshell company\u201d under Rule 405 of the Securities Act. As such, all restricted securities presently held by the founders of the Company may not be resold in reliance on Rule 144 until: (i) the Company files Form 10 information with the SEC when it ceases to be a \u201cshell company\u201d; (ii) the Company has filed all reports as required by Section 13 and 15(d) of the Securities Act for 12 consecutive months; and (iii) one (1) year has elapsed from the time the Company files the current Form 10 type information with the SEC reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the future; any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting it at such time as the board of directors may consider relevant. Our current intention is to apply net earnings, if any, in the foreseeable future to increasing our capital base and development and marketing efforts. There can be no assurance that the Company will ever have sufficient earnings to declare and pay dividends to the holders of our common stock, and in any event, a decision to declare and pay dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if its stock price appreciates.\nAuthorization of preferred stock.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time to time by its Board of Directors. Accordingly, our Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting, or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of the common stock. On July 16, 2019, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors approved the designation of two new series of preferred stock, Series K Super Voting Preferred Stock and Series L Preferred Stock. On August 2, 2019, the Company issued three (3) shares of its Series K Super Voting Preferred Stock to its sole officer and director, Jimmy Wayne Anderson.\nOn September 2, 2019, the Company issued ten (10) shares of its Series L Preferred Stock to Sylios Corp, an entity controlled by the Company\u2019s sole officer and director. In the event of issuance of additional shares, the preferred stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company. At present, we have authorized 5,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock with 13 and 0 shares outstanding at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Please see NOTE I - CAPITAL STOCK for further information.\nThe market price for our common stock may be particularly volatile given our status as a relatively unknown company, with a limited operating history and lack of profits which could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price. You may be unable to sell your common stock at or above your purchase price, which may result in substantial losses to you.\nOur stock price may be particularly volatile when compared to the shares of larger, more established companies that trade on a national securities exchange and have large public floats. The volatility in our share price will be attributable to a number of factors. First, our common stock will be compared to the shares of such larger, more established companies, sporadically and thinly traded. As a consequence of this limited liquidity, the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our shareholders may disproportionately influence the price of those shares in either direction. The price for our shares could decline precipitously in the event that a large number of shares of our common stock are sold on the market without commensurate demand. Second, we are a speculative or \u201crisky\u201d investment due to our limited operating history and lack of profits to date, and uncertainty of future market acceptance for our potential products. As a consequence of this enhanced risk, more risk-adverse investors may, under the fear of losing all or most of their investment in the event of negative news or lack of progress, be more inclined to sell their shares on the market more quickly and at greater discounts than would be the case with the stock of a larger, more established company that trades on a national securities exchange and has a large public float. Many of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. We cannot make any predictions or projections as to what the prevailing market price for our common stock will be at any time. Moreover, the OTC Bulletin Board is not a liquid market in contrast to the major stock exchanges. We cannot assure you as to the liquidity or the future market prices of our common stock if a market does develop. If an active market for our common stock does not develop, the fair market value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected.\nExisting stockholders will experience significant dilution from our sale of shares under potential Securities Purchase Agreements.\nThe sale of shares pursuant to any Securities Purchase Agreements executed by the Company in the future will have a dilutive impact on our stockholders. As a result, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly, as we sell shares pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement. In addition, for any particular advance, we will need to issue a greater number of shares of common stock under the Securities Purchase Agreement as our stock price declines. If our stock price is lower, then our existing stockholders would experience greater dilution.\nThe Company May Issue Shares of Preferred Stock with Greater Rights than Common Stock.\nThe Company\u2019s charter authorizes the Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock and set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from holders of the Company\u2019s common stock. Any preferred stock that is issued may rank ahead of the Company\u2019s common stock in terms of dividends, priority and liquidation premiums and may have greater voting rights than the Company\u2019s common stock.\nBeing a Public Company Significantly Increases the Company\u2019s Administrative Costs.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and listing requirements subsequently adopted by the NYSE Amex in response to Sarbanes-Oxley, have required changes in corporate governance practices, internal control policies and audit committee practices of public companies. Although the Company is a relatively small public company, these rules, regulations, and requirements for the most part apply to the same extent as they apply to all major publicly traded companies. As a result, they have significantly increased the Company\u2019s legal, financial, compliance and administrative costs, and have made certain other activities more time consuming and costly, as well as requiring substantial time and attention of our senior management. The Company expects its continued compliance with these and future rules and regulations to continue to require significant resources. These rules and regulations also may make it more difficult and more expensive for the Company to obtain director and officer liability insurance in the future and could make it more difficult for it to attract and retain qualified members for the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, particularly to serve on its audit committee.\nOur shares are subject to the U.S. \u201cPenny Stock\u201d Rules and investors who purchase our shares may have difficulty re-selling their shares as the liquidity of the market for our shares may be adversely affected by the impact of the \u201cPenny Stock\u201d Rules.\nOur stock is subject to U.S. \u201cPenny Stock\u201d rules, which may make the stock more difficult to trade on the open market. Our common shares are not currently traded on the OTC Bulletin Board, but it is the Company\u2019s plan that the common shares be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. A \u201cpenny stock\u201d is generally defined by regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) as an equity security with a market price of less than US$5.00 per share. However, an equity security with a market price under US $5.00 will not be considered a penny stock if it fits within any of the following exceptions:\n(i) the equity security is listed on NASDAQ or a national securities exchange;\n(ii) the issuer of the equity security has been in continuous operation for less than three years, and either has (a) net tangible assets of at least US $5,000,000, or (b) average annual revenue of at least US $6,000,000; or\n(iii) the issuer of the equity security has been in continuous operation for more than three years and has net tangible assets of at least US $2,000,000.\nOur common stock does not currently fit into any of the above exceptions.\nIf an investor buys or sells a penny stock, SEC regulations require that the investor receive, prior to the transaction, a disclosure explaining the penny stock market and associated risks. Furthermore, trading in our common stock will be subject to Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act, which relates to non-NASDAQ and non-exchange listed securities. Under this rule, broker/dealers who recommend our securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors must make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to a transaction prior to sale. Securities are exempt from this rule if their market price is at least $5.00 per share. Since our common stock is currently deemed penny stock regulations, it may tend to reduce market liquidity of our common stock, because they limit the broker/dealers\u2019 ability to trade, and a purchaser\u2019s ability to sell, the stock in the secondary market.\nThe low price of our common stock has a negative effect on the amount and percentage of transaction costs paid by individual shareholders. The low price of our common stock also limits our ability to raise additional capital by issuing additional shares. There are several reasons for these effects. First, the internal policies of certain institutional investors prohibit the purchase of low-priced stocks. Second, many brokerage houses do not permit low-priced stocks to be used as collateral for margin accounts or to be purchased on margin. Third, some brokerage house policies and practices tend to discourage individual brokers from dealing in low-priced stocks. Finally, broker\u2019s commissions on low-priced stocks usually represent a higher percentage of the stock price than commissions on higher priced stocks. As a result, the Company\u2019s shareholders may pay transaction costs that are a higher percentage of their total share value than if our share price were substantially higher.\nBecause we can issue additional shares of common stock, purchasers of our common stock may incur immediate dilution and experience further dilution.\nWe are authorized to issue up to 14,991,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 12,189,293,609 shares of common stock are issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019. Our Board of Directors has the authority to cause us to issue additional shares of common stock and to determine the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares, without consent of any of our stockholders. Consequently, the stockholders may experience more dilution in their ownership of our stock in the future. Please see NOTE-I CAPITAL STOCK for further information.\nA reverse stock split may decrease the liquidity of the shares of our common stock.\nThe liquidity of the shares of our common stock may be affected adversely by a reverse stock split given the reduced number of shares that will be outstanding following a reverse stock split, especially if the market price of our common stock does not increase as a result of the reverse stock split.\nFollowing a reverse stock split, the resulting market price of our common stock may not attract new investors, including institutional investors, and may not satisfy the investing requirements of those investors. Consequently, the trading liquidity of our common stock may not improve.\nAlthough we believe that a higher market price of our common stock may help generate greater or broader investor interest, we cannot assure you that a reverse stock split will result in a share price that will attract new investors.\nYou may be diluted by conversions of the Company\u2019s convertible notes and future conversions of the Company\u2019s Series L Preferred Stock.\nAs of June 30, 2020, we had (i) outstanding Convertible Promissory Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $1,417,827, which are convertible for up to 24,906,204,762 shares of our Class A Common Stock based on a closing stock price of $0.0001 and inherit conversion features; (iii) 10 shares of Series L Preferred Stock outstanding, which are convertible into 714,285,714 shares of our Class A Common Stock based on a closing stock price of $0.0001 and the inherit conversion feature.\nThe conversion of the Convertible Promissory Notes and Series L Preferred Stock will result in further dilution of your investment. In addition, you may experience additional dilution if we issue common stock in the future. As a result of this dilution, you may receive significantly less in net tangible book value than the full purchase price you paid for the shares in the event of liquidation. As of the date of this filing, the Company does not have a sufficient number of authorized but unissued shares to issue in the event our noteholders and the holder of our Series L Preferred stock were to elect to convert into shares of our Class A Common Stock. The Company may be required to file an Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Class A Common Stock or to effect a reverse stock split to satisfy the requested conversions.\nIssuances of shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of common stock following this offering, will dilute your ownership interests and may adversely affect the future market price of our common stock.\nThe issuance of additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock could be dilutive to stockholders if they do not invest in future offerings. We may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public offerings in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s shares of common stock are quoted on the OTC Pink Sheet market, which limits the liquidity and price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s shares of Common Stock are traded on the OTC Pink Sheet market under the symbol \u201cGTLL.\u201d Quotation of the Company\u2019s securities on the OTC Pink Sheet market limits the liquidity and price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock more than if the Company\u2019s shares of Common Stock were listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market or a national exchange. There is currently no active trading market in the Company\u2019s Common Stock. There can be no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Company\u2019s Common Stock following a business combination. In the event that an active trading market commences, there can be no assurance as to the market price of the Company\u2019s shares of Common Stock, whether any trading market will provide liquidity to investors, or whether any trading market will be sustained.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our stock.\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (\u201cFINRA\u201d) has adopted rules requiring that, in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative or low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA has indicated its belief that there is a high probability that speculative or low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. If these FINRA requirements are applicable to us or our securities, they may make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that at least some of their customers buy our common stock, which may limit the ability of our stockholders to buy and sell our common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market for and price of our common stock.\nWe are classified as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company.\u201d Specifically, \u201csmaller reporting companies\u201d are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings; are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings.\nBecause directors and officers currently and for the foreseeable future will continue to control Global Technologies, it is not likely that you will be able to elect directors or have any say in the policies of the Company\nOur shareholders are not entitled to cumulative voting rights. Consequently, the election of directors and all other matters requiring shareholder approval will be decided by majority vote. The directors, officers and affiliates of Global Technologies beneficially own approximately 30% of our outstanding common stock either through direct ownership or through another class of capital stock that may be convertible into shares of our common stock. Due to such significant ownership position held by our insiders, new investors may not be able to effect a change in our business or management, and therefore, shareholders would have no recourse as a result of decisions made by management. Our President, Jimmy Wayne Anderson, owns 900,000,000 shares of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock and 3 shares of Series K Super Voting Preferred stock. Sylios Corp, an entity controlled by Mr. Anderson, owns 10 shares of Series L Preferred stock convertible into 714,285,714 at a stock price of $0.0001. Our President is also the control person for one of the entities, Around the Clock Partners, LP (\u201cATC\u201d), that holds a Convertible Promissory Note issued by the Company. If the entire Note, in the amount of $124,800, were converted into shares of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock, the Company would be required to issue 3,120,000,000 shares. As of the date of this filing, our President would have voting rights equal to 98,414,348,976 shares (900,000,000 shares of common, 48,757,174,488 votes through the issuance of the Company\u2019s Series L Preferred Stock and 48,757,174,488 votes through the issuance of the Company\u2019s Series K Preferred Stock for a total of 98,414,348,976 votes) out of a total of 109,703,642,585 votes available to vote on matters brought before shareholders, or 89.70%. This total excludes shares issuable upon the conversion of the Note held by ATC.\nCautionary Note\nWe have sought to identify what we believe to be the most significant risks to our business, but we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, any of such risks may be realized nor can we guarantee that we have identified all possible risks that might arise. Investors should carefully consider all of such risk factors before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock.", "PERMNO": 81486, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "GTLL"}
