{"cik": "945114", "company": "SYSTEMAX INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThere are a number of factors and variables described below that may affect our future results of operations and financial condition. Other factors of which we are currently not aware or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our results of operations and financial position.\nRisks Related to the Economy and Our Industries\n\u00b7 General economic conditions, such as decreased consumer confidence and spending and reductions in manufacturing capacity have and could continue to result in our failure to achieve our historical sales growth rates and profit levels.\nCurrent economic conditions may cause the loss of consumer confidence in the Company\u2019s domestic and international markets which we believe resulted in a decrease of spending in the categories of products we sell in 2015, 2014 and 2013, which mostly impacted our now discontinued NATG business and to some extent our EMEA business. With conditions in the EMEA market for technology products remaining highly competitive, reductions in our selling prices, as we have experienced in recent years, have adversely affected our revenue and profits and could continue to do so in the future. It is also possible that as manufacturers react to the marketplace they may reduce manufacturing capacity or allocations to their customers creating shortages of product. Both we and our customers are subject to global political, economic and market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, energy costs, the impact of natural disasters, military action and the threat of terrorism. Our consolidated results of operations are directly affected by economic conditions in North America and Europe. We may experience a decline in sales as a result of poor economic conditions and the lack of visibility relating to future orders, which occurred in 2013 and 2014 in the discontinued NATG business and to some extent in our EMEA business between 2014 and 2015. Our results of operations depend upon, among other things, our ability to maintain and increase sales volumes with existing customers, our ability to limit price reductions and maintain our margins, our ability to attract new customers and the financial condition of our customers. A decline in the economy that adversely affects our customers, causing them to limit or defer their spending, would likely adversely affect our sales, prices and profitability as well, which occurred in 2013 and 2014 in the discontinued NATG business and to some extent in our EMEA business between 2014 and 2015. We cannot predict with any certainty whether we will be able to maintain or improve upon historical sales volumes with existing customers, or whether we will be able to attract new customers.\nIn response to economic and market conditions, from time to time we have undertaken initiatives to reduce our cost structure where appropriate, as occurred in the discontinued NATG business and in certain EMEA operations. These initiatives, as well as any future workforce and facilities reductions, may not be sufficient to meet current and future changes in economic and market conditions and allow us to continue to achieve the growth rates and re-attain the levels of profitability we experienced prior to the recent market downturns. In addition, costs actually incurred in connection with our restructuring actions may be higher than our estimates of such costs and/or may not lead to the anticipated cost savings.\nSee Operating History and Recent Restructuring of Our Business for a discussion of the closing of our NATG business in 2015.\n\u00b7 The markets for our products and services are extremely competitive and if we are unable to successfully respond to our competitors\u2019 strategies our sales and gross margins will be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors. The markets for our products and services are intensely competitive and subject to constant technological change. The adverse impact of the boom in mobile device sales on PC and laptop sales, demonstrate how rapid technological change can significantly affect the markets for the products we sell, as occurred in our discontinued NATG business. We expect this competition and technological change to further intensify in the future. Competitive factors include price, availability, service and support. Our ecommerce business faces pressure from competing with large, expanding ecommerce retailers. Many of our competitors are larger companies with greater financial, marketing and product development resources than ours. The market for the sale of industrial products in North America is highly fragmented and is characterized by multiple distribution channels such as small dealerships, direct mail distribution, internet-based resellers, large warehouse stores and retail outlets. We face competition from large diversified MRO distributors such as Grainger Inc., MSC Industrial Direct Inc., Fastenal Inc., and other large retailers, including ecommerce retailers such as Amazon.We also face competition from manufacturers\u2019 own sales representatives, who sell industrial equipment directly to customers, and from regional or local distributors. In addition, new competitors may enter our markets. This may place us at a disadvantage in responding to competitors\u2019 pricing strategies, technological advances and other initiatives, resulting in our inability to increase our revenues or maintain our gross margins in the future.\nIn most cases our products compete directly with those offered by other manufacturers and distributors. If any of our competitors were to develop products or services that are more cost-effective or technically superior, demand for our product offerings could decrease.\nOur gross margins are also dependent on the mix of products we sell and could be adversely affected by a continuation of our customers\u2019 shift to lower-priced products.\n\u00b7 Sales tax laws may be changed or interpreted differently which could result in ecommerce and direct mail retailers having to collect sales taxes in states where the current laws do not require us to do so. This could reduce demand for our products in such states and could result in us having substantial tax liabilities for past sales.\nOur United States subsidiaries collect and remit sales tax in states in which the subsidiaries have physical presence or in which we believe sufficient nexus exists which obligates us to collect sales tax. Other states may, from time to time, claim that we have state-related activities constituting physical nexus to require such collection. Additionally, many other states seek to impose sales tax collection or reporting obligations on companies that sell goods to customers in their state, or directly to the state and its political subdivisions, regardless of physical presence. Such efforts by states have increased recently, as states seek to raise revenues without increasing the income tax burden on residents. We rely on United States Supreme Court decisions which hold that, without Congressional authority, a state may not enforce a sales tax collection obligation on a company that has no physical presence in the state and whose only contacts with the state are through the use of interstate commerce such as the mailing of catalogs into the state and the delivery of goods by mail or common carrier. We cannot predict whether the nature or level of contacts we have with a particular state will be deemed enough to require us to collect sales tax in that state nor can we be assured that Congress or individual states will not approve legislation authorizing states to impose tax collection or reporting obligations on all e-commerce and/or direct mail transactions. A successful assertion by one or more states that we should collect sales tax on the sale of merchandise could result in substantial tax liabilities related to past sales and would result in considerable administrative burdens and costs for us and may reduce demand for our products from customers in such states when we charge customers for such taxes. See Legal Proceedings.\n\u00b7 Events such as acts of war or terrorism, natural disasters, changes in law, or large losses could adversely affect our insurance coverage and insurance expense, resulting in an adverse affect on our profitability and financial condition.\nWe insure for certain property and casualty risks consisting primarily of physical loss to property, business interruptions resulting from property losses, worker\u2019s compensation, comprehensive general liability, and auto liability. Insurance coverage is obtained for catastrophic property and casualty exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract. Although we believe that our insurance coverage is reasonable, significant events such as acts of war and terrorism, economic conditions, judicial decisions, legislation, natural disasters and large losses could materially affect our insurance obligations and future expense.\nRisks Related to Our Company\n\u00b7 We rely to a great extent on our information and telecommunications systems, and significant system failures or outages, or our failure to properly evaluate, upgrade or replace our systems, or the failure of our security/safety measures to protect our systems and websites, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe rely on a variety of information and telecommunications systems in our operations. Our success is dependent in large part on the accuracy and proper use of our information systems, including our telecommunications systems. To manage our growth, we continually evaluate the adequacy of our existing systems and procedures, and we have been engaged in transitioning key features of our current information and operating systems to a new platform we have developed specifically for our needs; delays or operational problems in effectively implementing the transition could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We have experienced some delays and operational problems in implementing new IT systems which have impacted timely transition to the new platform. We anticipate that we will regularly need to make capital expenditures to upgrade and modify our management information systems, including software and hardware, as we grow and the needs of our business change. The occurrence of a significant system failure, electrical or telecommunications outages or our failure to expand or successfully implement new systems could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur information systems networks, including our websites, and applications could be adversely affected by viruses or worms and may be vulnerable to malicious acts such as hacking. The availability and efficiency of sales via our websites could also be adversely affected by \u201cdenial of service\u201d attacks and other unfair competitive practices. Although we take preventive measures, these procedures may not be sufficient to avoid harm to our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\u00b7 We have exited our NATG business and could incur costs in excess of our estimated exit expenses.\nIn response to significant market pressures described above under the heading Operating History and Recent Restructuring of Our Business, the Company negotiated the sale of certain assets and liabilities of the NATG business to PCM. The sale transaction closed on December 1, 2015, though delivery of certain IT, website and other related assets was deferred to and completed in February 2016. As of this filing, the Company has completed most of the NATG wind down activities, including selling its remaining inventory, closing the two remaining TigerDirect retail stores, and closing its remaining NATG distribution center. Employee reductions were primarily completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 and currently approximately 30 employees remain at the Miami office. The Company expects that additional NATG wind-down costs incurred during 2016 or later will aggregate between $15 and $25 million, which will be presented in discontinued operations.\nThere can be no assurance the Company will be able to timely exit its existing lease commitments at expected costs levels. Failure to achieve these expectations will result in increased cash exit costs for the Company and could have a material adverse effect on its operating results.\n\u00b7 We have recently completed two acquisitions; our operations will be impacted by our ability to timely and efficiently transition and integrate those acquisitions with the rest of our business in the US and EMEA.\nThere are significant risks and uncertainties associated with effecting acquisition transactions, particularly in integrating and managing the combined operations, technologies, technology platforms and products of the acquired companies and realizing the anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner. Our failure to do so could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems. Integration efforts also may divert management attention and resources.\nWe have made two acquisitions in the past twenty four months, and there is a risk that integration difficulties or a significant decline in revenues of the acquired business may cause us not to realize expected benefits from the transactions and may affect our results. The success of these acquisitions depends on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the acquired businesses with our existing business, including growing the revenues of the acquired businesses through cross selling and other initiatives. We may not be able to achieve these objectives, in whole or in part, or be able to do so in a timely manner. Furthermore, the acquired businesses are, and will in the short term continue to be, engaged in transitioning their businesses from the existing IT platforms on which they operate (and which are licensed from the sellers of those businesses under standard transition services agreements) to our IT platforms. This transition is complicated and affects many inter-related business functions; if we are unable to timely and effectively affect the IT transition aspect of the integration, or fail to do so without disruption, the acquired businesses operations and our results would be materially adversely affected. The integration process, and the issues that can arise, can be complex and unforeseen operating challenges or unbudgeted situations can occur. Additional risks in acquisition transactions may include our inability to timely and effectively integrate the acquired company\u2019s accounting, human resource, and other administrative systems, and coordination of product, sales and marketing functions. In the case of foreign acquisitions, such as the acquisition of SCC/Misco Solutions, we will need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. Subject to certain exceptions, generally we will be responsible for the liabilities and obligations of the acquired businesses incurred or occurring prior to acquisition, including contingent liabilities. In this regard, we rely heavily on the representations and warranties provided to us by the sellers of acquired companies, including as they relate to compliance with laws and contractual requirements. If any of these representations and warranties is inaccurate or breached, such inaccuracy or breach could result in costly litigation and assessment of liability for which there may not be adequate recourse against such sellers, in part due to contractual time limitations and limitations of liability.\nIn addition difficulties in integrating acquired companies systems, controls, policies and procedures to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 may occur. Finally, potential accounting charges to the extent intangibles recorded in connection with an acquisition, such as goodwill, trademarks, customer relationships or intellectual property, are later determined to be impaired and written down in value.\n\u00b7 The establishment and integration of our shared service center in Hungary exposes us to various technology, regulatory and economic risks.\nWe opened our shared services center in Budapest, Hungary during the second quarter of 2013 to facilitate the continued growth of our EMEA business through operational efficiencies and enhanced internal processes. This facility provides administrative and back office services for the existing European business. As an incentive to locate in Hungary, the Hungarian Investment and Trade Agency (\u201cHITA\u201d) agreed to reimburse the Company for approximately 8% of payroll costs, up to a maximum of approximately $3.1 million, for the first 505 employees hired at the shared service center. The reimbursement is limited to the first twenty four months of employment for employees hired by December 2015 (or such lower number of employees as is negotiated with HITA) with all such reimbursements being completed by December 2017. In return for this incentive, the Company has committed to maintaining certain employment levels through 2020. The ongoing commitment is for less than 505 employees and accordingly the payroll cost reimbursement will be proportionally less. Failure by the Company to maintain these employment levels will result in the repayment of a portion or all of the related reimbursements we may receive with interest.\nOur efforts to operate our European business in a more centralized manner, rather than on an individual country by country basis, requires us to implement changes in our business processes, eliminate redundancies, relocate and/or hire new personnel, transition our information management systems, and integrate the new operation into our existing business seamlessly and without disruption to our operations, customers and vendors. However, delays or operational problems in transitioning our information management systems, a lower than expected impact of the facility on the Company\u2019s European operations, costs and capital expenditures, the ability to timely hire and train new employees in Hungary, and delays, impediments or other problems associated with its establishment could have a material adverse effect on our European operations and our results of operations.\n\u00b7 We rely on third party suppliers for most of our products and services. The loss or interruption of these relationships could impact our sales volumes, the levels of inventory we must carry, and/or result in sales delays and/or higher inventory costs from new suppliers. Co-operative advertising and other sales incentives provided by our suppliers have decreased and could decrease further in the future thereby increasing our expenses and adversely affecting our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe purchase a substantial portion of our products from major distributors and directly from large manufacturers who may deliver those products directly to our customers. These relationships enable us to make available to our customers a wide selection of products without having to maintain large amounts of inventory. The termination or interruption of our relationships with any of these suppliers could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe purchase a number of our products from vendors outside of the United States. Difficulties encountered by one or several of these suppliers could halt or disrupt production and delay completion or cause the cancellation of our orders. Delays or interruptions in the transportation network could result in loss or delay of timely receipt of product required to fulfill customer orders. Our ability to find qualified vendors who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S. Political or financial instability, merchandise quality issues, product safety concerns, trade restrictions, work stoppages, tariffs, foreign currency exchange rates, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, civil unrest, outbreaks of pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other issues affecting our vendors could materially adversely affect our revenue and gross profit.\nMany product suppliers provide us with co-operative advertising support in exchange for featuring their products in our catalogs and on our internet sites. Certain suppliers provide us with other incentives such as rebates, reimbursements, payment discounts, price protection and other similar arrangements. These incentives are offset against cost of goods sold or selling, general and administrative expenses, as applicable. The level of co-operative advertising support and other incentives received from suppliers has declined and may decline further in the future, increasing our cost of goods sold or selling, general and administrative expenses and have an adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows.\n\u00b7 Goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired resulting in a charge to earnings.\nThe Company has made acquisitions in the past of other businesses and these acquisitions resulted in the recording of significant intangible assets and/or goodwill. We are required to test goodwill and intangible assets annually to determine if the carrying values of these assets are impaired or on a more frequent basis if indicators of impairment exist. If any of our goodwill or intangible assets are determined to be impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the period during which the impairment is discovered. Previously, impairment charges on goodwill and intangible assets occurred in 2014 and 2013 for the NATG business. No impairment charges have occurred in IPG and EMEA. Although the carrying amounts of intangible assets and goodwill are relatively small as of December 31, 2015, to the extent the Company makes acquisitions in the future there could again be material amounts of such assets recorded and subject to future impairment testing.\n\u00b7 Our substantial international operations are subject to risks such as fluctuations in currency rates (which can adversely impact foreign revenues and profits when translated to US Dollars), foreign regulatory requirements, political uncertainty and the management of our growing international operations.\nWe operate internationally and as a result, we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally, such as risks related to the differing legal, political and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions. Risks inherent to operating internationally include:\n\u00b7 Changes in a country\u2019s economic or political conditions\n\u00b7 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates\n\u00b7 Difficulties with staffing and managing international operations\n\u00b7 Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements\n\u00b7 Changes in transportation and shipping costs\n\u00b7 Enforcement of intellectual property rights\nThe functional currencies of our businesses outside of the U.S. are the local currencies. Changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the U.S. Dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets, liabilities, net sales, cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange gains or losses. The primary currencies to which we have exposure are the European Union Euro, Canadian Dollar, British Pound Sterling, and the U.S. Dollar. Exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. Dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future. Our operating results and profitability may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks. For example, we currently have operations located in numerous countries outside the United States, and non-U.S. sales accounted for approximately 63.5% of our net sales from continuing operations during 2015. To the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, our foreign revenues and profits will be reduced when translated into U.S. dollars.\n\u00b7 We are exposed to various inventory risks, such as being unable to profitably resell excess or obsolete inventory and/or the loss of product return rights and price protection from our vendors; such events could lower our gross margins or result in inventory write-downs that would reduce reported future earnings.\nOur inventory is subject to risk due to technological change and changes in market demand for particular products. If we fail to manage our inventory of older products we may have excess or obsolete inventory. We may have limited rights to return purchases to certain suppliers and we may not be able to obtain price protection on these items. The elimination of purchase return privileges and lack of availability of price protection could lower our gross margin or result in inventory write-downs.\nWe also take advantage of attractive product pricing by making opportunistic bulk inventory purchases; any resulting excess and/or obsolete inventory that we are not able to re-sell could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Any inability to make such bulk inventory purchases may significantly impact our sales and profitability.\n\u00b7 We depend on bank credit facilities to address our working capital and cash flow needs from time to time, and if we are unable to renew or replace these facilities, or borrowing capacity were to be reduced our liquidity and capital resources may be adversely affected.\nWe require significant levels of capital in our business to finance accounts receivable and inventory. We maintain credit facilities in the United States to finance increases in our working capital if available cash is insufficient. The amount of credit available to us at any point in time may be adversely affected by the quality or value of the assets collateralizing these credit lines. In addition, in recent years global financial markets have experienced diminished liquidity and lending constraints. Our ability to obtain future and/or increased financing to satisfy our requirements as our business expands could be adversely affected by economic and market conditions, credit availability and lender perception of our Company and industry. Although our current credit facility expires in October 2016, we currently have no reason to believe that we will not be able to renew or replace our facilities when they reach maturity.\n\u00b7 If we fail to observe certain restrictions and covenants under our credit facilities the lenders could refuse to waive such default, terminate the credit facility and demand immediate repayment, which would adversely affect our cash position and materially adversely affect our operations.\nOur United States revolving credit agreement contains covenants restricting or limiting our ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7 incur additional debt\n\u00b7 create or permit liens on assets\n\u00b7 make capital expenditures or investments\n\u00b7 pay dividends\nIf we fail to comply with the covenants and other requirements set forth in the credit agreement, we would be in default and would need to negotiate a waiver agreement with the lenders. Failure to agree on such a waiver could result in the lenders terminating the credit agreement and demanding repayment of any outstanding borrowings, which could adversely affect our cash position and adversely affect the availability of financing to us, which could materially impact our operations.\n\u00b7 Our European employees are represented by unions or workers\u2019 councils or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the U.S.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 1,700 employees located in Europe and Asia. We have workers\u2019 councils representing the employees of our France, Germany, and Netherlands operations, and trade unions representing our employees in Italy and Sweden and elected employee representatives for our employees in the United Kingdom and Spain. Most of these European employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the U.S. Such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements. For example, most of our employees in Europe are represented by unions or workers\u2019 councils that must approve certain changes in conditions of employment, including salaries and benefits and staff changes, and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce. Although we believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees, a strike, work stoppage or slowdown by our employees or significant dispute with our employees could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs.\n\u00b7 The failure to timely and satisfactorily process manufacturers\u2019 and our own rebate programs could negatively impact our customer satisfaction levels.\nSimilar to other companies in the technology products industry, we advertise manufacturers\u2019 mail-in rebates on many products we sell and, in some cases, offer our own rebates. These rebates are processed through third party vendors and in house. If these rebates are not processed in a timely and satisfactory manner by either third party vendors or our in house operations, our reputation in the marketplace could be negatively impacted.\n\u00b7 We may be unable to reduce prices in reaction to competitive pressures, or implement cost reductions or new product line expansion to address gross profit and operating margin pressures; failure to mitigate these pressures could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nThe B2B computer, service solutions and electronics industry in which EMEA participates is highly price competitive and gross profit margins are narrow and variable. The Company\u2019s ability to further reduce prices in reaction to competitive pressure is limited. Additionally, gross margins and operating margins are affected by changes in factors such as vendor pricing, vendor rebate and/or price protection programs, product return rights, and product mix. In 2015 pricing pressure continued to be prevalent in the markets we serve and we expect this to continue. We may not be able to mitigate these pricing pressures and resultant declines in sales and gross profit margin with cost reductions in other areas or expansion into new product lines. If we are unable to proportionately mitigate these conditions our operating results and financial condition may suffer.\n\u00b7 We would be exposed to liability, including substantial fines and penalties and, in extreme cases, loss of our ability to accept credit cards, in the event our privacy and data security policies and procedures are inadequate to prevent security breaches of our consumer personal information and credit card information records.\nIn processing our sales orders we often collect personal information and credit card information from our customers. The Company has privacy and data security policies in place which are designed to prevent security breaches, however, if a third party or a rogue employee or employees are able to bypass our network security, \u201chack into\u201d our systems or otherwise compromise our customers\u2019 personal information or credit card information, we could be subject to liability. This liability may include claims for identity theft, unauthorized purchases and claims alleging misrepresentation of our privacy and data security practices or other related claims. While the Company believes it conforms to appropriate Payment Card Industry (\u201cPCI\u201d) security standards where necessary for its various businesses, any breach involving the loss of credit card information may lead to PCI related fines in the millions of dollars. In the event of a severe breach, credit card providers may prevent our accepting of credit cards. Any such liability related to the aforementioned risks could lead to reduced profitability and damage our brand(s) and/or reputation.\n\u00b7 Failure to protect the integrity, security and use of our customers\u2019 information could expose us to litigation and materially damage our standing with our customers.\nThe use of individually identifiable consumer data is regulated at the state, federal and international levels and we incur costs associated with information security - such as increased investment in technology and the costs of compliance with consumer protection laws. Additionally, our internet operations and website sales depends upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including the use of cashless payments. While we have taken significant steps to protect customer and confidential information, there can be no assurance that advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, the efforts of \u201chackers\u201d and cyber criminals or other developments will prevent the compromise of our customer transaction processing capabilities and our customers\u2019 personal data. If any such compromise of our security were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results and financial condition and could subject us to litigation.\n\u00b7 Sales to individual customers expose us to credit card fraud, which impacts our operations. If we fail to adequately protect ourselves from credit card fraud, our operations could be adversely impacted.\nFailure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions could increase our expenses. Increased sales to individual consumers, which are more likely to be paid for using a credit card, increases our exposure to fraud. We employ technology solutions to help us detect the fraudulent use of credit card information. However, if we are unable to detect or control credit card fraud, we may suffer losses as a result of orders placed with fraudulent credit card data, which could adversely affect our business.\n\u00b7 Our business is dependent on certain key personnel.\nOur business depends largely on the efforts and abilities of certain key senior management. The loss of the services of one or more of such key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\n\u00b7 We are subject to litigation risk due to the nature of our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. These may relate to, for example, patent, trademark or other intellectual property matters, employment law matters, states sales tax claims on internet/ecommerce transactions, product liability, commercial disputes, consumer sales practices, or other matters. In addition, as a public company we could from time to time face claims relating to corporate or securities law matters. The defense and/or outcome of such lawsuits or proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business. See \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d.\nFollowing the previously reported independent investigation of Gilbert Fiorentino and Carl Fiorentino by our Audit Committee in 2011 (in response to a whistleblower report) for a variety of improper acts, the subsequent termination of their employment and the entering into by Gilbert Fiorentino of a settlement agreement with the SEC, on November 20, 2014 the United States Attorney\u2019s Office (\u201cUSAO\u201d) for the Southern District of Florida announced that Gilbert Fiorentino and Carl Fiorentino had been charged with mail fraud, wire fraud and money laundering in connection with a scheme to defraud TigerDirect and Systemax. Specifically, the charges set forth a scheme to obtain kickbacks and other benefits, and to conceal this illicit income from the IRS, all while Gilbert Fiorentino and Carl Fiorentino were employed as senior executives at the Company\u2019s North America Technology Products business. On December 2, 2014, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office announced that Gilbert Fiorentino and Carl Fiorentino had pled guilty to various charges, and on March 3, 2015, Gilbert Fiorentino and Carl Fiorentino were sentenced to sixty and eighty months imprisonments, respectively. Following completion of their sentences, each is to be placed on supervised release for a period of thirty-six months. On March 1, 2016, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida awarded the Company approximately $36 million in restitution from Gilbert and Carl Fiorentino, which the Company will utilize all available means to collect.\nThe Company's Audit Committee, with the assistance of independent outside counsel, has been cooperating with a request by the USAO that it assist the USAO\u2019s investigation into allegations arising from the Fiorentino investigation regarding possible executive officer conflicts of interest and internal controls and books and records violations. The Company\u2019s Audit Committee, along with the Audit Committee\u2019s independent outside counsel, conducted an investigation of the allegations and its counsel presented the Audit Committee\u2019s findings to the USAO in July 2015. The Company has been advised that the Audit Committee investigation has found no evidence of executive officer conflicts of interest, and no material evidence of internal controls violations or books and records violations. The Audit Committee considers its investigation to be closed at this time and the Company has been advised there has been no further contact from the USAO. Notwithstanding, it is not possible at this time to predict if or when the USAO will conclude its investigation; what subject(s) will be investigated; what actions, if any, may be taken by the government as a result of its investigation; or whether any of these matters will have a material adverse impact on the Company.\n\u00b7 Our profitability can be adversely affected by changes in our income tax exposure due to changes in tax rates or laws, changes in our effective tax rate due to changes in the mix of earnings among different countries, restrictions on utilization of tax benefits and changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nChanges in our income tax expense due to changes in the mix of U.S. and non-U.S. revenues and profitability, changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate has been in the past and could be in the future adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, restrictions on utilization of tax benefits, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or by material audit assessments. The carrying value of our deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in those jurisdictions. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audit in our various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a tax authority could affect our profitability.\n\u00b7 Changes in accounting standards or practices, as well as new accounting pronouncements or interpretations, may require us to account for and report our financial results in a different manner in the future, which may be less favorable than the manner used historically.\nA change in accounting standards or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results of operations. New accounting pronouncements and interpretations of existing accounting rules and practices have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules may adversely affect our reported financial results.\n\u00b7 Concentration of Ownership and Control Limits Stockholders Ability to Influence Corporate Actions\nRichard Leeds, Robert Leeds, and Bruce Leeds (each are brothers and directors and executive officers of the Company), together with trusts for the benefit of certain members of their respective families and other entities controlled by them, control approximately 68.6% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Due to such holdings, the Leeds brothers together with these trusts and entities are able to determine the outcome of virtually all matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, the appointment of management, amendment of our articles of incorporation, significant corporate transactions (such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets), the payments of dividends on our common stock and the entering into of extraordinary transactions. Further, as a \"controlled company\" under NYSE rules, the Company has elected to opt-out of certain New York Stock Exchange listing standards that, among other things, require listed companies to have a majority of independent directors on their board; the Company does however currently have an independent Audit, Compensation Committee and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committees.\n\u00b7 Risk of Thin Trading and Volatility of our Common Stock Could Impact Stockholder Value\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NYSE and is thinly traded.
