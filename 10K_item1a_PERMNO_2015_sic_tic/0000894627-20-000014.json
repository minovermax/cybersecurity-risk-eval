{"cik": "894627", "company": "VAALCO ENERGY INC /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business faces many risks. You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report. If any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Any risks discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report and in our other SEC filings could also have a material impact on our business, financial position or results of operations. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we consider immaterial based on information currently available to us may also materially adversely affect us.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nCrude oil and natural gas prices are highly volatile, and a return to a very depressed price regime for a prolonged period of time will negatively affect our financial results.\nOur revenues, cash flow, profitability, crude oil and natural gas reserves value and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for crude oil and natural gas. Our ability to enter into debt financing arrangements and to obtain additional capital on reasonable terms is also substantially dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices. Historically, world-wide crude oil and natural gas prices and markets have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. During 2017, the spot price per Bbl of Brent crude oil ranged from a high of $67 to a low of $44. During 2018, the spot price per Bbl of Brent crude oil ranged from a high of $86 to a low of $51. During 2019, the spot price per Bbl of Brent crude oil ranged from a high of $75 to a low of $53. The average price at which we sold our crude oil in 2019 was $65.20 per Bbl as compared to $70.32 per Bbl in 2018 and $52.58 per Bbl in 2017. In early March 2020, crude oil prices declined to below $40 per barrel for Brent crude as a result of market concerns about the ability of OPEC and Russia to agree on a perceived need to implement further production cuts in response to weaker worldwide demand. VAALCO intends to manage both operating expenses as well as capital expenditure levels in view of the existing and expected pricing environment. In addition, the Company continues to evaluate all uses of cash and whether to pursue growth opportunities in light of ongoing economic conditions.\nBecause the crude oil price we are required to use by the SEC to estimate our future net cash flows is the average of the first day of the month price over the 12 months prior to the date of determination of future net cash flows, the full effect of increasing or falling prices may not be reflected in our estimated net cash flows for several quarters. We review the carrying value of our properties on a quarterly basis and once incurred, a write-down in the carrying value of our properties is not reversible at a later date, even if crude oil and natural gas prices increase.\nPrices for crude oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for crude oil and natural gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, increases in supplies from U.S. shale production, international political conditions, including uprisings and political unrest in the Middle East and Africa, the domestic and foreign supply of crude oil and natural gas, actions by OPEC member countries and other state-controlled oil companies to agree upon and maintain crude oil price and production controls, the\nlevel of consumer demand that is impacted by economic growth rates, weather conditions, domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes, the price and availability of alternative fuels, technological advances affecting energy consumption, the health of international economic and credit markets, changes in the level of demand resulting from global or national health epidemics and concerns, such as the recent coronavirus and general economic conditions. In addition, various factors, including the effect of federal, state and foreign regulation of production and transportation, general economic conditions, changes in supply due to drilling by other producers and changes in demand may adversely affect our ability to market our crude oil and natural gas production. Moreover, our commodity price hedging arrangements may not fully mitigate the effects volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices and may also curtail benefits from future increases in commodity prices.\nIn the event of depressed crude oil and natural gas prices, there is the risk that, among other things:\n\uf0b7our revenues, cash flows and profitability may decline substantially, which could also indirectly impact expected production by reducing the amount of funds available to engage in exploration, drilling and production;\n\uf0b7third parties\u2019 confidence in our commercial or financial ability to explore and produce crude oil and natural gas could erode, which could impact our ability to execute on our business strategy;\n\uf0b7it may become more difficult to retain, attract or replace key employees; and\n\uf0b7our suppliers, hedge counterparties, vendors and service providers could renegotiate the terms of our arrangements, terminate their relationship with us or require financial assurances from us.\nThe occurrence of certain of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUnless we are able to replace the proved reserve quantities that we have produced through acquiring or developing additional reserves, our cash flows and production will decrease over time.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had no PUDS. As discussed above in \u201cItem 1. Business - Segment and Geographic Information - Gabon Segment\u201d, we commenced our 2019/2020 drilling program during September 2019.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional crude oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. In general, production from crude oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted, with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics. Our ability to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our asset base of crude oil and natural gas reserves would be limited to the extent cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable. We may not be successful in exploring for, developing or acquiring additional reserves. Except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our estimated net proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are produced.\nThere can be no assurance that our development and exploration projects and acquisition activities will result in significant additional reserves or that we will have continuing success drilling productive wells at economic finding costs. The drilling of crude oil and natural gas wells involves a high degree of risk, especially the risk of dry holes or of wells that are not sufficiently productive to provide an economic return on the capital expended to drill the wells. Additionally, seismic and other technology does not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude oil or natural gas is present or economically producible. Our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including declines in crude oil or natural gas prices and/or prolonged periods of historically low crude oil and natural gas prices, weather conditions, political instability, availability of capital, economic/currency imbalances, compliance with governmental requirements, receipt of additional seismic data or the reprocessing of existing data, failure of wells drilled in similar formations, equipment failures (such as ESPs), delays in the delivery of equipment and availability of drilling rigs. If we are unable to increase our proved quantities, there will likely be a material impact on our cash flows, business and operations.\nAll of the value of our production and reserves is concentrated in a single block offshore Gabon, and any production problems or reductions in reserve estimates related to this property would adversely impact our business.\nThe Etame Marin block consists of five fields with 13 producing wells; however, one is currently temporarily shut-in pending workovers. Production from these fields constituted 100% of our total production for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, at December 31, 2019, 100% of our total reserves were attributable to these fields. If mechanical problems, storms or other events curtailed a substantial portion of this production, or if the actual reserves associated with this producing property are less than our estimated reserves, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nBecause our properties are concentrated in the same geographic area, many of our rights under the Etame PSC will be affected by the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than with respect to companies that have a more diversified portfolio of licenses and properties located across diverse geographic areas.\nExploring for, developing, or acquiring reserves is capital intensive and uncertain.\nWe may not be able to economically find, develop, or acquire additional reserves, or may not be able to make the necessary capital investments to develop our reserves, if our cash flows from operations decline or external sources of capital become limited or unavailable. Drilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be\nencountered. There can be no assurance that new wells drilled by us will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment. Drilling for crude oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells, but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues to return a profit after drilling, operating and other costs. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain and cost overruns are common. In particular, offshore drilling and development operations require highly capital-intensive techniques.\nOur drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including weather conditions, equipment failures or accidents, elevated pressure or irregularities in geologic formations, compliance with governmental requirements and shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment and services. If we are unable to continue drilling operations and we do not replace the reserves we produce or acquire additional reserves, our reserves revenues and cash flow will decrease over time, which could have a material effect on our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur business requires significant capital expenditures, and we may not be able to obtain needed capital or financing to fund our exploration and development activities or potential acquisitions on satisfactory terms or at all.\nOur exploration and development activities as well as our active pursuit of complementary opportunistic acquisitions are capital intensive. To replace and grow our reserves, we must make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition, exploitation, development, exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas reserves. Historically, we have financed these expenditures primarily with cash flow from operations, debt, asset sales, and private sales of equity. We are the operator of the Etame Marin block offshore Gabon, and are thus responsible for contracting on behalf of all the remaining parties participating in the project. We rely on the timely payment of cash calls by our joint owners to pay for 66.43% of the offshore Gabon budget. With respect to Block P, the EG MMH approved our appointment as technical operator on November 12, 2019. Since we have been appointed, we will rely on the timely payment of cash calls by our joint owners to pay for 61% of the Equatorial Guinea budget. The continued economic health of our joint owners could be adversely affected by low crude oil prices, thereby adversely affecting their ability to make timely payment of cash calls.\nIf low crude oil and natural gas prices, operating difficulties or declines in reserves result in our revenues being less than expected or limit our ability to enter into debt financing arrangements, or our joint owners fail to pay their share of project costs, we may be unable to obtain or expend the capital necessary to undertake or complete future drilling programs or to acquire additional reserves.\nWe do not currently have any commitments for future external funding for capital expenditures or acquisitions beyond cash generated from operating activities. Our ability to secure additional or replacement financing is currently limited. We cannot assure you that additional debt or equity financing or cash generated by operations will be available to meet our capital requirements and fund acquisitions. We may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. Even if we succeed in selling additional equity securities to raise funds, at such time the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders would be diluted, and new investors may demand rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing shareholders. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, the financing may involve covenants that restrict our business activities or our ability to make future acquisitions. If cash generated by operations or cash available under any financing sources is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to the development of our properties or prevent us from consummating acquisitions of additional reserves. Such a curtailment in operations or activities could lead to a decline in our estimated net proved reserves, and would likely materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf crude oil and natural gas prices decline materially, we may be required to take write-downs in the value of our crude oil and natural gas properties.\nThe estimated future net revenues attributable to our net proved reserves are prepared in accordance with current SEC guidelines and are not intended to reflect the fair market value of our reserves. In accordance with the rules of the SEC, our reserve estimates are prepared using the average price received for crude oil and natural gas based on closing prices of the average of the first day of the month price over the twelve-month period prior to the end of the reporting period. During 2019, 2018 and 2017, no impairments were necessary with respect to the Etame Marin block. Material declines in crude oil prices will cause the estimated quantities and present values of our reserves to be reduced, which may necessitate write-downs. Material declines in crude oil prices could also cause a decline in the estimated fair value and/or the economic viability of projects associated with our undeveloped leasehold costs for the Etame Marin block and the Equatorial Guinea Block P resulting in write-downs of these costs. In early March 2020, crude oil prices declined to below $40 per barrel for Brent crude as a result of market concerns about the ability of OPEC and Russia to agree on a perceived need to implement further production cuts in response to weaker worldwide demand. If at March 31, 2020 prices remain at this level or decline further, we may be required to take write-downs in the value of our crude oil and natural gas properties.\nOur offshore operations involve special risks that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOffshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks specific to the marine environment. Our production facilities are subject to hazards such as capsizing, sinking, grounding, collision and damage from severe weather conditions. The relatively deep offshore drilling conducted by us involves increased drilling risks of high pressures and mechanical difficulties, including stuck pipe, collapsed casing and separated cable. The impact that any of these risks may have upon us is increased due to the low number of producing properties we own. We could incur substantial expenses that could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration, development or license acquisitions, or result in loss of equipment and license interests.\nExploration and development operations offshore Africa often lack the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in other regions. As a result, a significant amount of time may elapse between an offshore discovery and the marketing of the associated crude oil and natural gas, increasing both the financial and operational risks involved with these operations. Offshore drilling operations generally require more time and more advanced drilling technologies, involving a higher risk of equipment failure and usually higher drilling costs. In addition, there may be production risks for which we are currently unaware. For example, the production of hydrogen sulfide at certain of our Etame Marin block wells create unexpected production losses and delays in our development plans; see \u201cItem 1. Business - Segment and Geographic Information - Hydrogen Sulfide Impact.\u201d The development of new subsea infrastructure and use of floating production systems to transport crude oil from producing wells, may require substantial time for installation or encounter mechanical difficulties and equipment failures that could result in loss of production, significant liabilities, cost overruns or delays.\nIn addition, in the event of a well control incident, containment and, potentially, cleanup activities for offshore drilling are costly. The resulting regulatory costs or penalties, and the results of third party lawsuits, as well as associated legal and support expenses, including costs to address negative publicity, could well exceed the actual costs of containment and cleanup. As a result, a well control incident could result in substantial liabilities for us, and have a significant negative impact on our earnings, cash flows, liquidity, financial position, and stock price.\nWe have less control over our investments in foreign properties than we would have with respect to domestic investments, and added risk in foreign countries may affect our foreign investments.\nOur international assets and operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties, including, among other things, the risks of war, expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts, taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions, changing political conditions, international monetary fluctuations, currency controls, decisions of international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, CEMAC and the Banking Commission of Central Africa, changes in laws and regulations relating to banking institutions and deposit accounts, requirements to hold funds in government-owned banks and the risk of foreign banking institution failure, possible changes in government personnel, the development of new administrative policies, practices and political conditions that may affect the enforcement or administration of laws and regulations, adoption of new or amendments to regulatory regimes for foreign investment, uncertainties as to whether the laws and regulations will be applicable in any particular circumstance, uncertainty as to whether VAALCO will be able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the applicable governing authorities, compliance with governmental or contractual requirements and foreign governmental regulations that favor or require the awarding of drilling contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction.\nFor example, the Gabonese government\u2019s oil company may seek to participate in crude oil and natural gas projects in a manner that could be dilutive to the interest of current license holders and the Gabonese government is under pressure from the Gabonese labor union to require companies to hire a higher percentage of Gabonese citizens. In 2016, the government of Gabon conducted an audit of our operations in Gabon, covering the years 2013 through 2014. We received the findings from this audit and responded to the audit findings in January 2017. Since providing our response, there have been changes in the Gabonese officials responsible for the audit. We are working with the current representatives to resolve the audit findings. While we do not anticipate that the assessments related to this audit will have significant, if any, negative impact on our reported earnings or cash flows, we can make no assurances that this will be the case. In addition, if a dispute arises with our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons, especially foreign crude oil ministries and national oil companies, to the jurisdiction of the U.S.\nAs part of securing the first of two five-year extensions to the Etame PSC, we agreed to a cash funding arrangement for the eventual abandonment of all offshore wells, platforms and facilities on the Etame Marin block. On March 5, 2019, in accordance with certain foreign currency regulatory requirements, the Gabonese branch of the international commercial bank holding the abandonment funds in a U.S. dollar denominated account transferred the funds to the CEMAC, of which Gabon is one of the six member states. The U.S. dollars were converted to local currency with a credit back to the Gabonese branch. The Etame PSC provides these payments must be denominated in U.S. dollars and the CEMAC regulations provide for establishment of a U.S. dollar account with the Central Bank. Although we have requested establishment of such account, the Central Bank has not complied with our requests. As a result, we were not able to make the annual abandonment funding payment in 2019. Pursuant to Amendment No. 5 to the Etame PSC, in the event that the Gabonese bank fails for any reason to reimburse all of the principal and interest due, we shall no longer be held liable for the resulting shortfall in funding the obligation to remediate the sites. For additional information, see \u201c-Our results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates and regulations.\u201d\nPrivate ownership of crude oil and natural gas reserves under crude oil and natural gas leases in the U.S. differs distinctly from our rights in foreign reserves where the state generally retains ownership of the minerals, and in many cases participates in, the exploration and production of hydrocarbon reserves. Accordingly, operations outside the U.S. may be materially affected by host governments through royalty payments, export taxes and regulations, surcharges, value added taxes, production bonuses and other charges.\nFor instance, the terms of the Etame PSC include provisions for, among other things, payments to the government of Gabon for a 13% royalty interest based on crude oil production at published prices and payments for a shared portion of \u201cprofit oil\u201d, based on daily production rates, which such \u201cprofit oil\u201d can be taken in-kind through taking crude oil barrels rather than making cash payments.\nAll of our proved reserves are related to the Etame Marin block located offshore Gabon. We have operated in Gabon since 1995 and believe we have good relations with the current Gabonese government. However, there can be no assurance that present or future administrations or governmental regulations in Gabon will not materially adversely affect our operations or cash flows.\nAcquisitions and divestitures of properties and businesses may subject us to additional risks and uncertainties, including that acquired assets may not produce as projected, may subject us to additional liabilities and may not be successfully integrated with our business. In addition, any sales or divestments of properties we make may result in certain liabilities that we are required to retain under the terms of such sales or divestments.\nOne of our growth strategies is to capitalize on opportunistic acquisitions of crude oil and natural gas reserves and/or the companies that own them and other strategic transactions that fit within our overall business strategy. Any future acquisition will require an assessment of recoverable reserves, title, future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, potential environmental hazards, potential tax and employer liabilities, regulatory requirements and other liabilities and similar factors. Ordinarily, our review efforts are focused on the higher valued properties and are inherently incomplete because it generally is not feasible to review in depth every potential liability on each individual property involved in each acquisition. Even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and potential problems, such as ground water contamination and other environmental conditions and deficiencies in the mechanical integrity of equipment are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Any unidentified problems could result in material liabilities and costs that negatively impact our financial condition.\nAdditional potential risks related to acquisitions include, among other things:\n\uf0b7incorrect assumptions regarding the reserves, future production and revenues, or future operating or development costs with respect to the acquired properties, as well as future prices of crude oil and natural gas;\n\uf0b7decreased liquidity as a result of using a significant portion of our cash from operations or borrowing capacity to finance acquisitions;\n\uf0b7significant increases in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance acquisitions;\n\uf0b7the assumption of unknown liabilities, losses or costs (including potential regulatory actions) that we are not indemnified for or that our indemnity, insurance or other protection is inadequate to protect against potential losses;\n\uf0b7an increase in our costs or a decrease in our revenues associated with any claims or disputes with governments or other interest owners;\n\uf0b7an incurrence of non-cash charges in connection with an acquisition and the potential future impairment of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in an acquisition;\n\uf0b7the risk that crude oil and natural gas reserves acquired may not be of the anticipated magnitude or may not be developed as anticipated;\n\uf0b7difficulties in the assimilation of the assets and operations of the acquired business, especially if the assets acquired are in a new business segment or geographic area;\n\uf0b7the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns during the acquisition and throughout the integration process;\n\uf0b7losses of key employees at the acquired businesses;\n\uf0b7difficulties in operating a significantly larger combined organization and adding operations;\n\uf0b7delays in achieving the expected synergies from acquisitions;\n\uf0b7the failure to realize expected profitability or growth;\n\uf0b7the failure to realize expected synergies and cost savings; and\n\uf0b7challenges in coordinating or consolidating corporate and administrative functions.\nIf we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly and you may not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in evaluating future acquisitions. In addition, acquisitions of businesses often require the approval of certain government or regulatory agencies and such approval could contain terms, conditions, or restrictions that would be detrimental to our business after a merger.\nIn the case of sales or divestitures of our properties and businesses, we may become exposed to future liabilities that arise under the terms of those sales or divestitures. Under such terms, sellers typically are required to retain certain liabilities for matters with respect to their sold properties or businesses. The magnitude of any such retained liability or indemnification obligation may be difficult to quantify at the time of the transaction and ultimately may be material. Also, as is typical in divestiture transactions, third parties may be unwilling to release us from guarantees or other credit support provided prior to the sale of the divested assets. As a result, after a sale, we may remain secondarily liable for the obligations guaranteed or supported to the extent that the buyer of the assets fails to perform these obligations. In addition, we may be required to recognize losses in accordance with exit or disposal activities.\nWe may experience a financial loss if our significant customer fails to pay us for our crude oil or natural gas or reduces the volume of crude oil and natural gas that they purchase from us.\nOur ability to collect payments from the sale of crude oil and natural gas to our customer depends on the payment ability of our customer base, which includes several significant customers. If our significant customer fails to pay us for any reason or letters of credit are insufficient or unavailable to mitigate the risk of nonpayment from our significant customer, we could experience a material loss. In addition, if our significant customer ceases to purchase our crude oil or natural gas or reduce the volume of the crude oil or natural gas that they purchase from us, the loss or reduction could have a detrimental effect on our production volumes and may cause a temporary interruption in sales of, or a lower price for, our crude oil and natural gas.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by violent acts such as from civil disturbances, terrorist acts, regime changes, cross-border violence, war, piracy, or other conflicts that may occur in regions that encompass our operations.\nViolent acts resulting in loss of life, destruction of property, environmental damage and pollution occur around the world. Many incidents are driven by civil, ethnic, religious or economic strife. In addition, the number of incidents attributed to various terrorist organizations has increased significantly. We operate in regions of the world that have experienced such incidents or are in close proximity to areas where violence has occurred.\nWe monitor the economic and political environments of the countries that we operate. However, we are unable to predict the occurrence of disturbances such as those noted above. In addition, we have limited ability to mitigate their impact.\nCivil disturbances, terrorist acts, regime changes, coups, wars, or conflicts, or the threats thereof, could have the following results, among others:\n\uf0b7volatility in global crude oil prices, which could negatively impact the global economy, resulting in slower economic growth rates, which could reduce demand for our products;\n\uf0b7negative impact on the world crude oil supply if infrastructure or transportation are disrupted, leading to further commodity price volatility;\n\uf0b7difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to work in areas with potential for conflict;\n\uf0b7inability of our personnel or supplies to enter or exit the countries where we are conducting operations;\n\uf0b7disruption of our operations due to evacuation of personnel;\n\uf0b7inability to deliver our production due to disruption or closing of transportation routes;\n\uf0b7reduced ability to export our production due to efforts of countries to conserve domestic resources;\n\uf0b7damage to or destruction of our wells, production facilities, receiving terminals or other operating assets;\n\uf0b7the incurrence of significant costs for security personnel and systems;\n\uf0b7damage to or destruction of property belonging to our commodity purchasers leading to interruption of deliveries, claims of force majeure, and/or termination of commodity sales contracts, resulting in a reduction in our revenues;\n\uf0b7inability of our service and equipment providers to deliver items necessary for us to conduct our operations resulting in a halt or delay in our planned exploration activities, delayed development of major projects, or shut-in of producing fields;\n\uf0b7lack of availability of drilling rig, oilfield equipment or services if third party providers decide to exit the region;\n\uf0b7the imposition of U.S. government or international sanctions that limit our ability to conduct our business;\n\uf0b7shutdown of a financial system, communications network, or power grid causing a disruption to our business activities; and\n\uf0b7capital market reassessment of risk and reduction of available capital making it more difficult for us and our joint owners to obtain financing for potential development projects.\nLoss of property and/or interruption of our business plans resulting from civil unrest could have a significant negative impact on our earnings and cash flows. In addition, we may not have enough insurance to cover any loss of property or other claims resulting from these risks. If any violent action causes us to become involved in a dispute, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of courts outside the United States or may not be successful in subjecting non-U.S. persons to the jurisdiction of courts in the United States or international arbitration, which could adversely affect the outcome of such dispute.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.\nAs a crude oil producer, we face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines; and threats from terrorist acts. The potential for such security threats has subjected our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. Costs for insurance may also increase as a result of security threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures\nand controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. If any of these security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nCybersecurity attacks in particular are becoming more sophisticated. We rely extensively on information technology systems, including internet sites, computer software, and data hosting facilities and other hardware and platforms, some of which are hosted by third parties, to assist in conducting our business. Our technologies systems and networks, and those of our business associates may become the target of cybersecurity attacks, including without limitation malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and systems, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems and materially and adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including the following:\n\uf0b7unauthorized access to and release of seismic data, reserves information, strategic information or other sensitive or proprietary information, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for crude oil and gas resources;\n\uf0b7data corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruption during drilling activities could result in failure to reach the intended target or a drilling incident;\n\uf0b7data corruption or operational disruption of production infrastructure, which could result in loss of production or accidental discharge;\n\uf0b7unauthorized access to and release of personal identifying information of employees and vendors, which could expose us to allegations that we did not sufficiently protect that information;\n\uf0b7a cybersecurity attack on a vendor or service provider, which could result in supply chain disruptions and could delay or halt operations;\n\uf0b7a cybersecurity attack on third-party gathering, transportation, processing, fractionation, refining or export facilities, which could delay or prevent us from transporting and marketing our production, resulting in a loss of revenues;\n\uf0b7a cybersecurity attack involving commodities exchanges or financial institutions could slow or halt commodities trading, thus preventing us from marketing our production or engaging in hedging activities, resulting in a loss of revenues; and\n\uf0b7business interruptions, including use of social engineering schemes and/or ransomware, could result in expensive remediation efforts, distraction of management, damage to our reputation, or a negative impact on the price of our common stock.\nTo protect against such attempts of unauthorized access or attack, we have implemented multiple layers of cybersecurity protections, infrastructure protection technologies, disaster recovery plans and employee training. While we have invested significant amounts in the protection of our technology systems and maintain what we believe are adequate security controls over sensitive data, there can be no guarantee such plans, to the extent they are in place, will be effective.\nAny cyber incident could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability. Additionally, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period.\nCompetitive industry conditions may negatively affect our ability to conduct operations.\nThe crude oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive. We compete with, and may be outbid by, competitors in our attempts to acquire exploration and production rights in crude oil and natural gas properties. These properties include exploration prospects as well as properties with proved reserves. There is also competition for contracting for drilling equipment and the hiring of experienced personnel. Factors that affect our ability to compete in the marketplace include, among other things:\n\uf0b7our access to the capital necessary to drill wells and acquire properties;\n\uf0b7our ability to acquire and analyze seismic, geological and other information relating to a property;\n\uf0b7our ability to retain and hire experienced personnel, especially for our engineering, geoscience and accounting departments; and\n\uf0b7the location of, and our ability to access, platforms, pipelines and other facilities used to produce and transport crude oil and natural gas production.\nOur competitors include major integrated oil companies and substantial independent energy companies, many of which possess greater financial, technological, personnel and other resources than we do. These companies may be better able to: competitively bid for and purchase crude oil and natural gas properties; evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties than our financial or human resources permit; continue drilling during periods of low crude oil and natural gas prices; contract for drilling equipment; and secure trained personnel. Our competitors may also use superior technology that we may be unable to afford or that would require costly investment by us in order to compete.\nCompetition due to advances in renewable fuels may lessen the demand for our products and negatively impact our profitability.\nAlternatives to petroleum-based products and production methods are continually under development. For example, a number of automotive, industrial and power generation manufacturers are developing alternative clean power systems using fuel cells or clean-burning gaseous fuels that may address increasing worldwide energy costs, the long-term availability of petroleum reserves and\nenvironmental concerns, which if successful could lower the demand for crude oil and natural gas. If these non-petroleum based products and crude oil alternatives continue to expand and gain broad acceptance such that the overall demand for crude oil and natural gas is decreased, it could have an adverse effect on our operations and the value of our assets.\nWeather, unexpected subsurface conditions and other unforeseen operating hazards may adversely impact our crude oil and natural gas activities.\nThe crude oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating risks, including fire, explosions, blow-outs, pipe failure, casing collapse, abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards such as crude oil spills, natural gas leaks, ruptures and discharges of toxic gases, underground migration and surface spills or mishandling of fracture fluids including chemical additives, the occurrence of any of which could result in substantial losses to us due to injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution and other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations.\nWe maintain insurance against some, but not all, potential risks; however, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover any losses or exposure for liability. The occurrence of a significant unfavorable event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, we cannot predict whether insurance will continue to be available at a reasonable cost or at all.\nThe physical and regulatory impact of climate change could disrupt our business and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to their effects.\nClimate change could have an effect on the severity of weather (including hurricanes and floods), sea levels, the arability of farmland, and water availability and quality. If such effects were to occur, our exploration and production operations have the potential to be adversely affected. Potential adverse effects could include damages to our facilities from powerful winds or rising waters in low-lying areas, disruption of our production activities because of climate-related damages to our facilities, less efficient or non-routine operating practices necessitated by climate effects or increased costs for insurance coverages in the aftermath of such effects. Significant physical effects of climate change could also have an indirect effect on our financing and operations by disrupting the transportation or process-related services provided by midstream companies, service companies or suppliers with whom we have a business relationship. We may not be able to recover through insurance some or any of the damages, losses or costs that may result from potential physical effects of climate change.\nIn addition, we expect continued and increasing regulatory attention to climate change issues and emissions of greenhouse gases, including methane (a primary component of natural gas) and carbon dioxide (a byproduct of crude oil and natural gas combustion). For example, in April 2016, 195 nations, including Gabon, Equatorial Guinea and the U.S., signed and officially entered into an international climate change accord (the \u201cParis Agreement\u201d). The Paris Agreement calls for signatory countries to set their own greenhouse gas emissions targets, make these emissions targets more stringent over time and be transparent about the greenhouse gas emissions reporting and the measures each country will use to achieve its greenhouse gas targets. A long-term goal of the Paris Agreement is to limit global temperature increase to well below two degrees Celsius from temperatures in the pre-industrial era. The Paris Agreement is effectively a successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol treaty, an international treaty aimed at reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, to which various countries and regions are parties. It cannot be determined at this time what effect the Paris Agreement, and any related greenhouse gas emissions targets, regulations or other requirements, will have on our business, results of operations and financial condition. It also cannot be determined what impact the U.S.'s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement will have on international climate change regulation. This regulatory uncertainty, however, could result in a disruption to our business or operations.\nWe may not have enough insurance to cover all of the risks we face and operators of prospects in which we participate may not maintain or may fail to obtain adequate insurance.\nOur business is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration for and production, gathering, processing, and transportation of crude oil and natural gas, including blowouts, cratering and fire, any of which could result in damage to, or destruction of, crude oil and natural gas wells or formations, production facilities, and other property, as well as injury to persons. For protection against financial loss resulting from these operating hazards, we maintain insurance coverage, including insurance coverage for certain physical damage, blowout/control of a well, comprehensive general liability, worker\u2019s compensation and employer\u2019s liability. However, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover us against 100% of potential losses arising as a result of the foregoing, and for certain risks, such as political risk, nationalization, business interruption, war, terrorism, and piracy, for which we have limited or no coverage. In addition, we are not insured against all risks in all aspects of our business, such as hurricanes. The occurrence of a significant event that we are not fully insured against could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur reserve information represents estimates that may turn out to be incorrect if the assumptions that these estimates are based are inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present values of our reserves.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves, including many factors beyond our control. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating the underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The estimates included in this document are based on various assumptions required\nby the SEC, including non-escalated prices and costs and capital expenditures subsequent to December 31, 2019, and, therefore, are inherently imprecise indications of future net revenues. Actual future production, revenues, taxes, operating expenses, development expenditures and quantities of recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. Any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves.\nIn addition, our reserves may be subject to downward or upward revision based upon production history, results of future development, availability of funds to acquire additional reserves, prevailing crude oil and natural gas prices and other factors. Moreover, the calculation of the estimated present value of the future net revenue using a 10% discount rate as required by the SEC is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with our reserves or the crude oil and natural gas industry in general. It is also possible that reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and future net revenues based on the same available data.\nThe estimated future net revenues attributable to our net proved reserves are prepared in accordance with current SEC guidelines, and are not intended to reflect the fair market value of our reserves. In accordance with the rules of the SEC, our reserve estimates are prepared using an average of the first day of the month prices received for crude oil and natural gas for the preceding twelve months. Future reductions in prices, below the average calculated for 2019, would result in the estimated quantities and present values of our reserves being reduced.\nOur proved reserves are in foreign countries and are or will be subject to service contracts, production sharing contracts and other arrangements. The quantity of crude oil and natural gas that we will ultimately receive under these arrangements will differ based on numerous factors, including the price of crude oil and natural gas, production rates, production costs, cost recovery provisions and local tax and royalty regimes. Changes in many of these factors could affect the estimates of proved reserves in foreign jurisdictions.\nOur results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates and by currency regulations.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency risk from our foreign operations. While crude oil sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, portions of our costs in Gabon are denominated in the local currency. A weakening U.S. dollar will have the effect of increasing costs while a strengthening U.S. dollar will have the effect of reducing operating costs. The Gabon local currency is tied to the Euro. The exchange rate between the Euro and the U.S. dollar has fluctuated widely in recent years in response to international political conditions, general economic conditions, the European sovereign debt crisis and other factors beyond our control. Our financial statements, presented in U.S. dollars, may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. In addition, currency devaluation can result in a loss to us for any deposits of that currency, such as our deposits in the Etame PSC abandonment account, which have been converted from U.S. dollar to Gabon local currency. See the risk factor \u201cWe have less control over our investments in foreign properties than we would have with respect to domestic investments, and added risk in foreign countries may affect our foreign investments.\u201d Hedging foreign currencies can be difficult, especially if the currency is not actively traded.\nWe are also subject to risks relating to governmental regulation of foreign currency, which may limit our ability to:\n\uf0b7transfer funds from or convert currencies in certain countries;\n\uf0b7repatriate foreign currency received in excess of local currency requirements; and\n\uf0b7repatriate funds held by our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. at favorable tax rates.\nWe have been, and in the future may become, involved in legal proceedings with governmental and private litigants, and, as a result, may incur substantial costs in connection with those proceedings.\nOur business subjects us to liability risks from litigation or government actions. From time to time we may be a defendant or plaintiff in various lawsuits. The nature of our operations exposes us to further possible litigation claims in the future. There is risk that any matter in litigation could be decided unfavorably against us regardless of our belief, opinion, and position, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Litigation can be very costly, and the costs associated with defending litigation could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, net cash flows and financial condition. Adverse litigation decisions or rulings may also damage our business reputation.\nOften, our operations are conducted through joint ventures that we may have limited influence and control. Private litigation or government proceedings brought against us could also result in significant delays in our operations.\nCompliance with environmental and other government regulations could be costly and could negatively impact production.\nThe laws and regulations of the U.S., Gabon, and Equatorial Guinea regulate our current business. These laws and regulations may require that we obtain permits for our development activities, limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain protected or sensitive areas, or restrict the substances that can be released in connection with our operations. Our operations could result in liability for personal injuries, property damage, natural resource damages, crude oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean-up costs and other environmental damages. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties and the issuance of orders enjoining operations. In addition, we could be liable for environmental damages caused by, among others, previous property owners or operators of properties that we purchase or lease. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liabilities for remediation of releases of hazardous substances, rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part\nof such person. As a result, we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities and may be required to incur substantial remediation costs. We could also be affected by more stringent laws and regulations adopted in the future, including any related to climate change and greenhouse gases and the use of hydraulic fracturing fluids, resulting in increased operating costs. As a result, substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred, the payment of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nThese laws and governmental regulations, which cover matters including drilling operations, taxation and environmental protection, may be changed from time to time in response to economic or political conditions and could have a significant impact on our operating costs, as well as the crude oil and natural gas industry in general. While we believe that we are currently in compliance with environmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations, no assurances can be given that we will be able to continue to comply with such environmental laws and regulations without incurring substantial costs.\nIf our assumptions underlying accruals for abandonment costs are too low, we could be required to expend greater amounts than expected.\nAlmost all of our properties, which have future abandonment obligations, are located offshore. The costs to abandon offshore wells may be substantial. For financial accounting purposes, we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period that it is incurred and capitalize the related costs as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived assets. The estimated liability is reflected in the \u201cAsset retirement obligation\u201d line item of our consolidated balance sheets.\nAs part of the Etame Marin block production license, we are subject to an agreed upon cash funding arrangement for the eventual abandonment of all offshore wells, platforms and facilities on the Etame Marin block. Based upon the most recent abandonment study completed in November 2018, the abandonment cost estimate used for this purpose is approximately $61.8 million ($19.2 million net to VAALCO) on an undiscounted basis. On an annual basis over the remaining life of the production license, we must fund a portion of these estimated abandonment costs. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Segment and Geographic Information - Gabon Segment -Abandonment Costs,\u201d for further information. Future changes to the anticipated abandonment cost estimates could change our asset retirement obligations and increase the amount of future abandonment funding payments we are obligated to make.\nWe operate in international jurisdictions, and we could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government and other officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. Despite our training and compliance programs, we cannot be assured that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from acts of corruption committed by our employees or agents. Any additional expansion outside the U.S., including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations in the future. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by political, social and economic instability of the region in which we operate.\nWe operate in countries that have experienced political, social and economic instability or are in close proximity to areas where such events have and continue to occur. In Gabon, allegations of voting irregularities were reported after the most recent presidential elections in August 2016. The contested re-election of Ali Bongo triggered protests and violence between supporters of the opposition candidate, Jean Ping, who declared himself the victor, and government security forces. This public unrest included arson of the Lower House of Parliament, damage of private property and damage to the headquarters of the opposition party. On January 7, 2019, a group of five Gabonese soldiers briefly took control of the Gabon Television headquarters. Government security forces regained control of the broadcasting headquarters the same day and the state\u2019s operations returned to normal the next day. Mr. Bongo suffered a stroke during an official visit to Saudi Arabia in October 2018 after which he has spent extensive periods recuperating outside of Gabon. Mr. Bongo has since returned to Gabon to fulfill his role as president.\nSince 2017, Gabonese employee unions in the judicial administration, tax administration and other financial institutions have declared a succession of strikes. These strikes have caused various administrative delays.\nIn Equatorial Guinea, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo has been President since 1979. There have been several attempted coups in recent history, notably in 2002, 2004 and 2009, when the Presidential Palace allegedly came under attack. In January 2018, the authorities claimed to have thwarted an attempted coup the previous month.\nSince 2006, the President of Equatorial Guinea has changed Government appointments every two or three years. In May 2018, the Supreme Court upheld a ban on the country\u2019s main opposition party, the CI Party, which was accused of involvement in acts of violence ahead of elections held in November 2017.\nWhile we monitor the economic and political environments of the countries in which we operate, loss of property and/or interruption of our business plans resulting from civil unrest could have a significant negative impact on our earnings and cash flow. In addition, we may not have enough insurance to cover any loss of property or other claims resulting from these risks.\nWe operate in countries and regions that are subject to legal and regulatory risk.\nInvestment in companies with assets in developing countries is generally only suitable for sophisticated investors who fully appreciate the significance of the risks involved in, and are familiar with, investing in developing countries. Investors should also note that developing countries could be subject to rapid change and that the information set out in this document may become outdated relatively quickly. Moreover, financial turmoil in developing countries tends to adversely affect prices in equity markets of other developing countries as investors move their money to more stable, developed markets.\nOur operations in Etame, Block P and any future opportunistic acquisitions of oil and natural gas reserves may require protracted negotiations with host governments, local governments and communities, local competent authorities, national oil companies and third parties and may be subject to economic, social and political considerations outside of our control, such as the risks of expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation, forced interruption, suspension of operations, curtailment of sales, forced change or nullification of existing contracts or royalty rates, unenforceability of contractual rights, changing taxation policies or interpretations, adverse changes to laws (whether of general application or otherwise) or the interpretation or enforcement of laws, foreign exchange restrictions, inflation, changing political conditions, the death or incapacitation of political leaders, local currency devaluation, currency controls and foreign governmental regulations that favor or require the awarding of contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction.\nWhile the laws of each of Gabon and Equatorial Guinea respectively recognize private and public property and the right to own property is protected by law, the laws of each country reserve, at the respective government\u2019s discretion, the right to expropriate property and terminate contracts (including the Etame PSC and the Block P PSC) for reasons of public interest, subject to reasonable compensation, determinable by the respective government in its discretion.\nThe respective applicable laws governing the exploration and production of hydrocarbons in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea (Law No. 002/2019 in Gabon and Law No. 8/2006 9 in Equatorial Guinea) each provide the respective government officials with significantly broad regulatory, inspective and auditing powers with respect to the performance of petroleum operations, which include the powers to negotiate, sign, amend and perform all contracts entered into between the respective governments and independent contractors. The executive branches of each respective government also retain significant discretionary powers, giving considerable control over the executive, judiciary and legislative branches of each government, and the ability to adopt measures with a direct impact on private investments and projects, including the right to appoint ministers responsible for petroleum operations. Further, in Equatorial Guinea, any new PSC or equivalent agreement for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons is subject to presidential ratification before it can become effective.\nAny of the factors detailed above or similar factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. If disputes arise in connection with our operations in Gabon, Equatorial Guinea or any future jurisdiction in which we operate, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or foreign arbitration tribunals or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons, especially foreign ministries and national companies, to the legal jurisdiction of the United States.\nWhile we are not aware of any activities that would lead to the seizure of any assets, we cannot guarantee that there will not be regulations imposed on any individual or company that is related to our operations or our activities in the relevant region. Such measures, which would be beyond our control, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and the price of our common stock.\nWe could lose our interest in Block P if the terms for lifting the suspension are not met.\nUnder the terms of lifting of the suspension, a new joint owner was expected to assume GEPetrol\u2019s working interest obligations and was expected to be presented to the EG MMH by March 28, 2019. The EG MMH approved our appointment as operator for Block P on November 12, 2019, and we are currently waiting on a production sharing contract amendment to begin activities in Block P. If the joint owners of Block P fail to meet the commitments under the production sharing contract amendment, VAALCO\u2019s capitalized costs associated with Block P interest would be impaired.\nCommodity derivatives transactions we enter into may fail to protect us from declines in commodity prices.\nIn order to reduce the impact of commodity price uncertainty and increase cash flow predictability relating to the marketing of our crude oil and natural gas, we have entered into derivatives arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production. Our derivative contracts consist of a series of commodity swap contracts and are limited in duration. Our derivatives program may be inadequate to protect us from significant and prolonged declines in the price of crude oil.\nDerivative arrangements also expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:\n\uf0b7production is less than the volume covered by the derivative instruments; or\n\uf0b7the counter-party to the derivative instrument defaults on its contract obligations.\nIn addition, certain types of derivative arrangements may limit the benefit we could receive from increases in the prices for crude oil and natural gas and may expose us to cash margin requirements.\nThe distressed financial conditions of one or more hedge providers could have an adverse impact on us in the event these hedge providers are unable to pay us amounts owed to us under one or more financial hedge transactions by which we have hedged our exposure to commodity price volatility.\nFrom time to time, we may enter into financial hedge transactions to hedge or mitigate our exposure to the risks of commodity price volatility with respect to the crude oil or natural gas we produce and sell. In such instances, the hedge provider will be obligated to make payments to us under such financial hedge transactions to the extent that the floating (market) price is below an agreed fixed (strike) price. Hedging agreements expose us to risk of financial loss if the counterparty to a hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations. Disruptions in the market could also occur that lead to sudden changes in the liquidity of the counterparties to our hedge transactions that limit their ability to perform under their hedging contracts with us. Even if we do accurately predict sudden changes, our ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions. If the creditworthiness of our counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance, we could incur a significant loss.\nThere are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud that could seriously harm our business may occur and not be detected.\nIn the past, our management has concluded that certain control deficiencies either individually or in the aggregate constituted a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. While the material weakness has been remediated and our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019, our management does not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent or detect all possible errors or all instances of fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, an evaluation of controls can only provide reasonable assurance that all material control issues and instances of fraud, if any, in our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistakes. Further, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or by two or more persons acting in collusion. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of inherent limitations in any control system designed under a cost-effective approach, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. A failure of our controls and procedures to detect error or fraud could seriously harm our business and results of operations.\nOur business could suffer if we lose the services of, or fail to attract, key personnel.\nWe are highly dependent upon the efforts of our senior management and other key employees. The loss of the services of our Chief\n\u200eExecutive Officer, President and Chief Financial Officer, as well as any loss of the services of one or more other members of our senior management, could delay or prevent the achievement of our objectives. We do not maintain any \u201ckey-man\u201d insurance policies on any of our senior management, and do not intend to obtain such insurance. In addition, due to the specialized nature of our business, we are highly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel with extensive experience and expertise in evaluating and analyzing drilling prospects and producing crude oil and natural gas from proved properties and maximizing production from crude oil and natural gas properties. There is competition for qualified personnel in the areas of our activities, and we may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining these personnel.\nWe face various risks associated with increased activism against crude oil and natural gas exploration and development activities.\nOpposition toward crude oil and natural gas drilling and development activity has been growing globally. Companies in the crude oil and natural gas industry are often the target of activist efforts from both individuals and non-governmental organizations regarding safety, human rights, climate change, environmental matters, sustainability, and business practices. Anti-development activists are working to, among other things, delay or cancel certain operations such as offshore drilling and development.\nFuture activist efforts could result in the following:\n\uf0b7delay or denial of drilling permits;\n\uf0b7shortening of lease terms or reduction in lease size;\n\uf0b7restrictions or delays on our ability to obtain additional seismic data;\n\uf0b7restrictions on installation or operation of gathering or processing facilities;\n\uf0b7restrictions on the use of certain operating practices;\n\uf0b7legal challenges or lawsuits;\n\uf0b7damaging publicity about us;\n\uf0b7increased regulation;\n\uf0b7increased costs of doing business;\n\uf0b7reduction in demand for our products; and\n\uf0b7other adverse effects on our ability to develop our properties and/or undertake production operations.\nActivism worldwide may increase if the current administration in the U.S. is perceived to be following, or actually follows, through on certain proposed initiatives to promote increased fossil fuel exploration and production in the U.S. Our need to incur costs associated with responding to these initiatives or complying with any resulting new legal or regulatory requirements resulting from these activities that are substantial and not adequately provided for, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nOur common stock currently trades on the NYSE and the LSE, but an active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly as a result of:\n\uf0b7dilutive issuances of our common stock;\n\uf0b7announcements relating to our business or the business of our competitors;\n\uf0b7changes in expectations as to our future financial performance or changes in financial estimates of public market analysis;\n\uf0b7actual or anticipated quarterly variations in our operating results;\n\uf0b7conditions generally affecting the crude oil and natural gas industry;\n\uf0b7the success of our operating strategy; and\n\uf0b7the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control, and we cannot predict their potential effects on the price of our common stock. In addition, the stock markets in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations. Financial markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in the last several years that have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of companies and that have, in many cases, been unrelated to the operating performance, underlying asset values or prospects of such companies. Accordingly, the market price of the common stock may decline even if our operating results, underlying asset values or prospects have not changed. Additionally, these factors, as well as other related factors, may cause decreases in asset values that are deemed to be other than temporary, which may result in impairment losses. Also, certain institutional investors may base their investment decisions on consideration of our environmental, governance and social practices and performance against such institutions\u2019 respective investment guidelines and criteria, and failure to meet such criteria may result in a limited or no investment in our common stock by those institutions, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. There is no assurance that continuing fluctuations in the price and volume of publicly traded equity securities will not occur. If such increased levels of volatility and market turmoil continue, our operations could be adversely impacted, and the trading price of the common stock may be adversely affected.\nSubstantial future sales of common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, or additional offerings of common stock could depress the market price of our common stock.\nWe cannot predict what effect, if any, future sales of common stock, or the availability of common stock for future sale, or the offer of additional common stock in the future, will have on the market price of common stock. Sales or an additional offering of substantial numbers of common stock in the public market, or the perception or any announcement that such sales or an additional offering could occur, could adversely affect the market price of common stock and may make it more difficult for shareholders to sell their common stock at a time and price which they deem appropriate and could also impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of equity securities.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on the common stock and our ability to pay dividends in the future may be limited; consequently, the only opportunity for investors to achieve a return on their investment is if the price of the common stock appreciates.\nWe have never declared or paid dividends on our common stock. We intend to retain future earnings, if any, to support the development of the business, and therefore do not anticipate paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Payment of future dividends, if any, would be at the discretion of the board of directors after taking into account various factors, including current financial condition, the tax impact of repatriating cash, operating results and current and anticipated cash needs. Consequently, investors must rely on sale of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment.\nWe may not continue to repurchase shares under our stock repurchase plan and our repurchases may not materially enhance the long-term value of our business or stock.\nOn June 20, 2019, we announced that our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase plan pursuant to which we may repurchase up to $10.0 million of our common stock. Pursuant to the plan, share repurchases may be made through a variety of methods, including open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block purchases and other methods. The timing and number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, our capital allocation policy and alternative investment opportunities. Our repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Any repurchases of our stock pursuant to the stock repurchase plan may\nmaterially reduce the amount of cash we have available and may not materially enhance the long-term value of our business or our stock.\nDual-listing on the NYSE and the LSE may lead to an inefficient market in the common stock.\nDual-listing of our common stock will result in differences in liquidity, settlement and clearing systems, trading currencies, prices and transaction costs between the exchanges where the common stock will be quoted. These and other factors may hinder the transferability of the common stock between the two exchanges.\nThe common stock is quoted on the NYSE and on the LSE. Consequently, the trading in and liquidity of the common stock is split between these two exchanges. The price of the common stock may fluctuate and may at any time be different on the NYSE and the LSE. Investors could seek to sell or buy common stock to take advantage of any price differences between the two markets through a practice referred to as arbitrage. Any arbitrage activity could create unexpected volatility in both common stock prices on either exchange and in the volumes of common stock available for trading on either market. This could adversely affect the trading of the common stock on these exchanges and increase their price volatility and/or adversely affect the price and liquidity of the common stock on these exchanges. In addition, holders of common stock in either jurisdiction will not be immediately able to transfer such shares for trading on the other market without effecting necessary procedures with our transfer agents/registrars. This could result in time delays and additional cost for shareholders.\nThe common stock is quoted and traded in USD on the NYSE. The common stock is quoted and traded in GBX on the LSE. The market price of the common stock on those exchanges may also differ due to exchange rate fluctuations.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not contain any rights of preemption in favor of existing shareholders, which means that shareholders may be diluted if additional common stock is issued.\nOur shareholders do not have preemptive rights and we, without shareholder consent, may issue additional common stock, preferred shares, warrants, rights, units and debt securities for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, working capital, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions and repayment or refinancing of borrowings. We actively seek to expand our business through complementary or strategic acquisitions and may issue additional common stock in connection with those acquisitions. We also issue common stock to our executive officers, employees and independent directors as part of their compensation. This may have the effect of diluting the interests of existing shareholders. Additionally, to the extent that preemptive rights are granted, shareholders in certain jurisdictions may experience difficulties or may be unable to exercise their preemptive rights.\nAny issuance of preferred shares will rank in priority to the common stock.\nWhile VAALCO does not currently have any Preferred Shares outstanding, under the Certificate of Incorporation, VAALCO is authorized to issue up to 500,000 Preferred Shares. Any issuance of Preferred Shares would rank in priority to the Common Shares with respect to payment of dividends, liquidation, and other matters.", "PERMNO": 78841, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "EGY"}
