{"cik": "1590895", "company": "Eldorado Resorts, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisk Factors Relating to our Operations\nOur business is sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending as a result of downturns in the economy and other factors outside our control\nConsumer demand for casino hotel and racetrack properties such as ours is particularly sensitive to downturns in the economy and the associated impact on discretionary spending on leisure activities. Changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as perceived or actual general economic conditions, effects of declines in consumer confidence in the economy, including the recent housing, employment and credit crisis, the impact of high energy and food costs, the increased cost of travel, the potential for continued bank failures, decreased disposable consumer income and wealth, or fears of war and future acts of terrorism could further reduce customer demand for the amenities that we offer, which have had a negative impact on our results of operations in the past and could negatively impact our results of operations in the future. Increases in gasoline prices, including increases prompted by global political and economic instabilities, can adversely affect our operations because most of our patrons travel to our properties by car or on airlines that may pass on increases in fuel costs to passengers in the form of higher ticket prices. In addition, security concerns, terrorist attacks and other geopolitical events can have a material adverse effect on leisure and business travel, discretionary spending and other areas of economic behavior that directly impact the gaming and entertainment industries in general and our business in particular. Economic downturns, geopolitical events and other related factors which impact discretionary consumer spending and other economic activities have had direct effects on our business and the tourism industry in the past. We cannot be sure how these factors will impact our operations in the future or the extent of the impact.\nWe face substantial competition in the hotel and casino industry and expect that such competition will continue\nThe gaming industry is characterized by an increasingly high degree of competition among a large number of participants, including land-based casinos, dockside casinos, riverboat casinos, casinos located on racing tracks and casinos located on Native American reservations and other forms of legalized gaming. We also compete, to a lesser extent, with other forms of legalized gaming and entertainment such as online computer gambling, bingo, pull tab games, card parlors, sports books, fantasy sports websites, \u201ccruise-to-nowhere\u201d operations, pari-mutuel or telephonic betting on horse racing and dog racing, state-sponsored lotteries, jai-alai, and, in the future, may compete with gaming at other venues. In addition, we compete more generally with other forms of entertainment for the discretionary spending of our customers.\nCertain states have legalized casino gaming and other states may legalize gaming in the future. Legalized casino gaming in these states and on Native American reservations near our markets or changes to gaming laws in states surrounding our operations could increase competition and could adversely affect our operations. There has been significant competition in our markets as a result of the expansion of facilities by existing market participants, the entrance of new gaming participants into a market or legislative changes in prior years. For example, casino gaming is currently prohibited in several jurisdictions from which the Shreveport/Bossier City market draws customers, primarily Texas. The Texas legislature has from time to time considered proposals to legalize gaming, and there can be no assurance that casino gaming will not be approved in Texas in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on Eldorado Shreveport. Additionally, since visitors from California comprise a significant portion of our customer base in Reno, we also compete with Native American gaming operations in California. Native American tribes are allowed to operate slot machines, lottery games and banking and percentage games on Native American lands. Although many existing Native American gaming facilities in northern California are modest compared to the Nevada properties, a number of Native American tribes have established large-scale gaming facilities in California. In addition, various forms of internet gaming have been approved in Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware, and legislation permitting internet gaming has been proposed by the federal government and other states. The expansion of internet gaming in Nevada and other jurisdictions could result in significant additional competition.\nGaming competition is intense in most of the markets in which we operate. There has been significant competition in our markets as a result of the expansion of facilities by existing market participants, the entrance of new gaming participants into a market or legislative changes in prior years. For example, casino gaming is currently prohibited in several jurisdictions from which the Shreveport/Bossier City market draws customers, primarily Texas. The Texas legislature has from time to time considered proposals to legalize gaming, and there can be no assurance that casino gaming will not be approved in Texas in the future, which may have a negative effect on our business. Additionally, since visitors from California comprise a significant portion of our customer base in Reno, we also compete with Native American gaming operations in California. Native American tribes are allowed to operate slot machines, lottery games and banking and percentage games on Native American lands. Although many existing Native American gaming facilities in northern California are modest compared to the Nevada properties, a number of Native American tribes have established large-scale gaming facilities in California. An additional license has been granted for a casino to be located in Lawrence County, Pennsylvania, approximately 45 miles from Mountaineer and 90 miles from Presque Isle Downs, which would result in further competition for both of those properties. Further, gaming facilities in Ohio that commenced operations in recent years present significant competition for Mountaineer, Presque Isle Downs and Scioto Downs.\nIncreased competition may require us to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain and enhance the competitive positions of our properties to increase the attractiveness and add to the appeal of our facilities. Because we are highly leveraged, after satisfying our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient funds to undertake these expenditures or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing to fund such expenditures. If we are unable to make such expenditures, our competitive position could be negatively affected.\nWe are subject to extensive state and local regulation and licensing, and gaming authorities have significant control over our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business\nLicensing Requirements. The ownership and operation of casino gaming, riverboat and horseracing facilities are subject to extensive federal, state, and local regulation, and regulatory authorities at the federal, state, and local levels have broad powers with respect to the licensing of gaming businesses and may revoke, suspend, condition or limit our gaming or other licenses, impose substantial fines, and take other actions, each of which poses a significant risk to our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We currently hold all state and local licenses and related approvals necessary to conduct our present gaming operations, but we must periodically apply to renew many of our licenses and registrations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such renewals. Any failure to maintain or renew our existing licenses, registrations, permits or approvals would have a material adverse effect on us. Furthermore, if additional laws or regulations are adopted or existing laws or regulations are amended, these regulations could impose additional restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us. As an example, on August 26, 2014, the Board of Health of Hancock County, West Virginia adopted and approved the Clean Air Regulation Act of 2014 (\u201cRegulation\u201d), which became effective July 1, 2015. The Regulation bans smoking in public places in Hancock County including at Mountaineer. To comply with the Regulation upon its effective date, Mountaineer built a 9,300 square foot smoking pavilion which opened on July 1, 2015 and currently houses 322 slot machines and four table games. Notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate the impact of the smoking ban, the Regulation has had a negative impact on our business and results of operations at Mountaineer. We expect that the Regulation will continue to, and any similar regulations enacted in the future may, negatively impact our business and results of operations and such impact would be material.\nGaming authorities with jurisdiction over our operations may, in their discretion, require the holder of any securities issued by us to file applications, be investigated, and be found suitable to own our securities if they have reason to believe that the security ownership would be inconsistent with the declared policies of their respective jurisdictions. Further, the costs of any investigation conducted by any of the Gaming Authorities under these circumstances must be paid by the applicant, and refusal or failure to pay these charges may constitute grounds for a finding that the applicant is unsuitable to own the securities. If any of the Gaming Authorities determines that a person is unsuitable to own our securities, then, under the applicable gaming or horse racing laws and regulations, we can be sanctioned, including the loss of approvals that are required for us to continue our gaming operations in the relevant jurisdictions, if such unsuitable person does not timely sell our securities.\nOur officers, directors, and key employees are also subject to a variety of regulatory requirements and various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities. If any of the applicable Gaming Authorities were to find an officer, director or key employee of ours unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would have to sever all relationships with that person. Furthermore, the Gaming Authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Either result could materially adversely affect our gaming operations.\nApplicable gaming laws and regulations restrict our ability to issue securities, incur debt and undertake other financing activities. Such transactions would generally require approval of applicable Gaming Authorities, and our financing counterparties, including lenders, might be subject to various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities. If state regulatory authorities were to find any person unsuitable with regard to his, her or its relationship to us or any of our subsidiaries, we would be required to sever our relationships with that person, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nCompliance with Other Laws. We are also subject to a variety of other federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances that apply to non-gaming businesses, including zoning, environmental, construction and land-use laws and regulations governing the serving of alcoholic beverages. Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of, or is responsible for, the presence of such substances or wastes. We have not identified any issues associated with our properties that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on us or the results of our operations. However, several of our properties are located in industrial areas or were used for industrial purposes for many years. As a consequence, it is possible that historical or neighboring activities have affected one or more of our properties and that, as a result, environmental issues could arise in the future, the precise nature of which we cannot now predict. The coverage and attendant compliance costs associated with these laws, regulations and ordinances may result in future additional costs.\nRegulations adopted by FINCEN require us to report currency transactions in excess of $10,000 occurring within a gaming day, including identification of the patron by name and social security number. U.S. Treasury Department regulations also require us to report certain suspicious activity, including any transaction that exceeds $5,000, if we know, suspect or have reason to believe that the transaction involves funds from illegal activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements. Substantial penalties can be imposed if we fail to comply with these regulations. FINCEN has recently increased its focus on gaming companies.\nWe are required to report certain customer\u2019s gambling winnings via form W-2G to comply with current Internal Revenue Service regulations. Should these regulations change, we would expect to incur additional costs to comply with the revised reporting requirements.\nA new rule implemented by the U.S. Department of Labor (\u201cDOL\u201d), which was expected to become effective December 1, 2016, provides that certain exempt salaried employees making below $47,476 annually will be eligible for overtime. We expect to incur additional costs associated with complying with this revised rule. In November 2016, a U.S. District Court of the Eastern District of Texas issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the implementation of the DOL rule.\nTaxation and Fees. In addition, gaming companies are generally subject to significant revenue-based taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state, and local income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. We pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations. From time to time, federal, state, and local legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. In addition, worsening economic conditions could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes and/or property taxes. It is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws. Such changes, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The large number of state and local governments with significant current or projected budget deficits makes it more likely that those governments that currently permit gaming will seek to fund such deficits with new or increased gaming taxes and/or property taxes, and worsening economic conditions could intensify those efforts. Any material increase, or the adoption of additional taxes or fees, could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results.\nWe rely on our key personnel and we may face difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified employees for our casinos and race tracks\nOur future success will depend upon, among other things, our ability to keep our senior executives and highly qualified employees. We compete with other potential employers for employees, and we may not succeed in hiring or retaining the executives and other employees that we need. A sudden loss of or inability to replace key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nIn addition, the operation of our business requires qualified executives, managers and skilled employees with gaming and horse racing industry experience and qualifications who are able to obtain the requisite licenses and approval from the applicable Gaming Authorities. While not currently the case, there has from time to time been a shortage of skilled labor in our markets. In addition to limitations that may otherwise exist in the supply of skilled labor, the continued expansion of gaming near our facilities, including the expansion of Native American gaming, may make it more difficult for us to attract qualified individuals. While we believe that we will continue to be able to attract and retain qualified employees, shortages of skilled labor will make it increasingly difficult and expensive to attract and retain the services of a satisfactory number of qualified employees, and we may incur higher costs than expected as a result.\nOur operations in certain jurisdictions depend on agreements with third parties\nOur operations in several jurisdictions depend on agreements with third parties. If we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms as they expire, our business may be disrupted and, in the event of disruptions in multiple jurisdictions, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFor example, the Federal Interstate Horse Racing Act and the state racing laws in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania require that, in order to simulcast races, we have written agreements with the horse owners and trainers at those racetracks. In addition, in order to operate slot machines in West Virginia, we are required to enter into written agreements regarding the proceeds of the slot machines (a \u201cproceeds agreement\u201d) with a representative of a majority of the horse owners and trainers and with a representative of a majority of the pari-mutuel clerks.\nIf we fail to maintain operative agreements with the horsemen at any of our racetracks, we will not be permitted to conduct live racing and export and import simulcasting at the applicable racetrack. In addition, if we fail to maintain operative agreements with the horsemen at Mountaineer, Presque Isle Downs and Scioto Downs (including if we do not have in place the legally required proceeds agreement with the Mountaineer pari-mutuel clerks union), we will not be permitted to continue our gaming operations at those facilities. If we fail to renew or modify existing agreements on satisfactory terms, this failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWork stoppages, organizing drives and other labor problems could negatively impact our future profits\nSome of our employees are currently represented by labor unions. A lengthy strike or other work stoppages at any of our casino properties could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Given the large number of employees, labor unions are making a concerted effort to recruit more employees in the gaming industry. In addition, organized labor may benefit from new legislation or legal interpretations by the current presidential administration. Particularly, in light of current support for changes to federal and state labor laws, we cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and more successful union organization activity in the future.\nBecause portions of the land on which our facilities are situated are leased, the termination of such leases could adversely affect our business\nWe lease certain parcels of land on which several of our properties are located, including a portion of the parcel on which Eldorado Reno is located, the land on which Eldorado Shreveport is built and a portion of the property on which Circus Reno is located. As a ground lessee, we have the right to use the leased land; however, we do not hold fee ownership in the underlying land. Accordingly, with respect to the leased land, we will have no interest in the land or improvements thereon at the expiration of the ground leases. Moreover, since we do not completely control the land underlying the property, a landowner could take certain actions to disrupt our rights in the land leased under the long-term leases which are beyond our control. If the entity owning any leased land chose to disrupt our use either permanently or for a significant period of time, then the value of our assets could be impaired and our business and operations could be adversely affected. If we were to default on any one or more of these leases, the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected land and any improvements on the land, including the hotels and casinos. This would have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations as we would then be unable to operate all or portions of the affected facilities and may result in the default under the agreements governing our indebtedness.\nBecause we own real property, we will be subject to extensive environmental regulation, which creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that govern activities that may have adverse environmental effects, such as discharges to air and water, as well as the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of solid, animal and hazardous wastes and exposure to hazardous materials. These laws and regulations are complex and frequently subject to change. In addition, our horseracing facilities are subject to laws and regulations that address the impacts of manure and wastewater generated by Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (\u201cCAFO\u201d) on water quality, including, but not limited to, storm water discharges. CAFO regulations include permit requirements and water quality discharge standards. Enforcement of CAFO regulations has been receiving increased governmental attention. Compliance with these and other environmental laws can, in some circumstances, require significant capital expenditures. We have from time to time been responsible for investigating and remediating, or contributing to remediation costs related to, contamination located at or near certain of our facilities, including contamination related to underground storage tanks and groundwater contamination arising from prior uses of land on which certain of our facilities are located. In addition, we have been, and may in the future be, required to manage, abate, remove or contain manure and wastewater generated by concentrated animal feeding operations due to our racetrack operations, mold, lead, asbestos-containing materials or other hazardous conditions found in or on our properties. Moreover, violations can result in significant fines or penalties and, in some instances, interruption or cessation of operations.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations that create liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of regulated materials into the environment. Certain of these laws and regulations impose strict, and under certain circumstances joint and several, liability on a current or previous owner or operator of property for the costs of remediating regulated materials on or emanating from its property. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of those substances may be substantial.\nAn earthquake, flood, other natural disaster or act of terrorism could adversely affect our business\nAlthough we maintain insurance that is customary and appropriate for our business, each of our insurance policies is subject to certain exclusions. In addition, in some cases our property insurance coverage is combined among certain of our properties or is otherwise in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding our facilities in the event of a total loss. Such losses may occur as a result of any number of casualty events, including as a result of earthquakes, floods, hurricanes or other severe weather conditions. In particular, the Reno area has been, and may in the future be, subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters and Eldorado Shreveport is located in a designated flood zone. Inadequate insurance or lack of available insurance for these and other certain types or levels of risk could expose us to significant losses in the event that a catastrophe occurred for which we are underinsured. In addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss, we may suffer business disruption as a result of the casualty event or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed. While we carry general liability insurance and business interruption insurance, there can be no assurance that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all loss and damage to which our business or our assets might be subjected. In addition, certain casualty events, such as labor strikes, nuclear events, loss of income due to terrorism, deterioration or corrosion, insect or animal damage and pollution, may not be covered under our policies. Any losses we incur that are not adequately covered by insurance may decrease our future operating income, require us to fund replacements or repairs for destroyed property and reduce the funds available for payments of our obligations. Further, we renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from coverage. Among other factors, it is possible that regional political tensions, homeland security concerns, other catastrophic events or any change in government legislation governing insurance coverage for acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect available insurance coverage and result in increased premiums on available coverage (which may cause us to elect to reduce its policy limits), additional exclusions from coverage or higher deductibles. Among other potential future adverse changes, in the future we may elect to not, or may not be able to, obtain any coverage for losses due to acts of terrorism.\nWe are subject to risks relating to mechanical failure, forces of nature, casualty, extraordinary maintenance and other causes\nAll of our facilities will generally be subject to the risk that operations could be halted for a temporary or extended period of time, as the result of casualty, forces of nature, mechanical failure, or extended or extraordinary maintenance, among other causes. In addition, our gaming operations could be damaged or halted due to extreme weather conditions. These risks are particularly pronounced at Eldorado Shreveport\u2019s riverboat and dockside facilities because of their location on and adjacent to water.\nWe are or may become involved in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could impact our business and financial condition\nFrom time to time, we are named in lawsuits or other legal proceedings relating to our respective businesses. In particular, the nature of our business subjects us to the risk of lawsuits filed by customers, past and present employees, competitors, business partners and others in the ordinary course of business. As with all legal proceedings, no assurances can be given as to the outcome of these matters. Moreover, legal proceedings can be expensive and time consuming, and we may not be successful in defending or prosecuting these lawsuits, which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur information technology and other systems are subject to cyber security risk including misappropriation of customer information or other breaches of information security\nOur operations require that we collect customer data, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information, for various business purposes, including marketing and promotional purposes. The collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations enacted in the United States and other jurisdictions around the world. Privacy regulations continue to evolve and on occasion may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Our information and processes are subject to the ever-changing threat of compromised security in the form of a risk of potential breach, system failure, computer virus, or unauthorized or fraudulent use by customers, company employees, or employees of third-party vendors. The steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks may not be successful, and any resulting compromise or loss of data or systems could adversely impact operations or regulatory compliance and could result in remedial expenses, fines, litigation, and loss of reputation, potentially impacting our financial results.\nIn addition, third-party service providers and other business partners process and maintain proprietary business information and data related to our guests, suppliers and other business partners. Our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit this information, or those of service providers or business partners, may also be compromised by a malicious third-party penetration of its network security or that of a third-party service provider or business partner, or impacted by intentional or unintentional actions or inactions by its employees or those of a third-party service provider or business partner. As a result, our business information, guest, supplier, and other business partner data may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without their consent.\nAny such loss, disclosure or misappropriation of, or access to, guests' or business partners\u2019 information or other breach of our information security can result in legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, may have a serious impact on our reputation and may adversely affect its businesses, operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, the loss, disclosure or misappropriation of our business information may adversely affect our reputation, businesses, operating results and financial condition.\nOur operations have historically been subject to seasonal variations and quarterly fluctuations in operating results, and we can expect to experience such variations and fluctuations in the future\nHistorically, our operations have typically been subject to seasonal variations. Our strongest operating results for our Reno properties have generally occurred in the second and third quarters and the weakest results have generally occurred during the period from November through February when weather conditions adversely affected operating results. Winter conditions can frequently adversely affect transportation routes to Reno, where approximately two-thirds of our visitors arrive by ground transportation and certain of our other properties and cause cancellations of live horse racing. In particular, since January 1, 2017, the Reno-Tahoe area has experienced exceptionally high levels of snowfall in the first quarter of 2017, with certain resorts in the Tahoe area reporting over 50 feet of snowfall during such time, which has adversely affected visitation to our Reno properties and may adversely affect our results of operations for the first quarter. As a result, unfavorable seasonal conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nBecause we will be heavily dependent upon hotel/casino and related operations that are conducted in certain limited regions, we will be subject to greater risks than a company that is geographically or otherwise more diversified\nOur business is heavily dependent upon hotel/casino and related operations that are conducted in three discrete markets. As a result, we are still subject to a greater degree of risk than a gaming company that has greater geographical diversity. The risks to which we have a greater degree of exposure include the following:\n\u2022\nlocal economic and competitive conditions;\n\u2022\ninaccessibility due to weather conditions, road construction or closure of primary access routes;\n\u2022\nchanges in local and state governmental laws and regulations, including gaming laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nnatural and other disasters, including earthquakes and flooding;\n\u2022\na decline in the number of residents in or near, or visitors to, our operations; and\n\u2022\na decrease in gaming activities at any of our facilities.\nAny of the factors outlined above could adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness.\nSignificant negative industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates or lack of growth in our business may cause us to incur impairments to indefinite-lived intangible assets or long-lived assets\nWe test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or if a triggering event occurs. We will also be required to consider whether the fair values of any of our investments accounted for under the equity method have declined below their carrying value whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that recorded values may not be recoverable. Estimated fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimated future results of the investee and market indicators of the terminal year capitalization rate. If any such declines are considered to be other than temporary, we will be required to record a write-down to estimated fair value.\nThe concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry could impose additional costs on us\nThere are a limited number of slot machine manufacturers servicing the gaming industry and a large majority of our revenues are derived from slot machines at our casinos. It is important, for competitive reasons, that we offer the most popular and up-to-date slot machine games with the latest technology to customers.\nIn recent years, slot machine manufacturers have frequently refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games, instead requiring participating lease arrangements. Generally, a participating lease is substantially more expensive over the long-term than the cost to purchase a new slot machine.\nFor competitive reasons, we may be forced to purchase new slot machines, slot machine systems, or enter into participating lease arrangements that are more expensive than our current costs associated with the continued operation of its existing slot machines. If the newer slot machines do not result in sufficient incremental revenues to offset the increased investment and participating lease costs, it could adversely affect profitability.\nWe materially rely on a variety of hardware and software products to maximize revenue and efficiency in our operations. Technology in the gaming industry is developing rapidly, and we may need to invest substantial amounts to acquire the most current gaming and hotel technology and equipment in order to remain competitive in the markets in which we operate. Ensuring the successful implementation and maintenance of any new technology acquired is an additional risk.\nWe may experience construction delays or cost overruns during its expansion or development projects that could adversely affect our operations\nFrom time to time, we may commence construction projects on new properties or at our current properties. We also evaluate other expansion opportunities as they become available and may in the future engage in additional construction projects. The anticipated costs and construction periods for construction projects are based upon budgets, conceptual design documents and construction schedule estimates prepared by us in consultation with its architects. Construction projects entail significant risks, which can substantially increase costs or delay completion of a project. Such risks include shortages of materials or skilled labor, unforeseen engineering, environmental or geological problems, work stoppages, weather interference and unanticipated cost increases. Most of these factors are beyond our control. In addition, difficulties or delays in obtaining any of the requisite licenses, permits or authorizations from regulatory authorities can increase the cost or delay the completion of an expansion or development. Significant budget overruns or delays with respect to expansion and development projects could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisk Factors Relating to the Isle of Capri Acquisition\nThe Merger Agreement subjects the Company to restrictions on its business activities during the pendency of the Mergers.\nThe Merger Agreement subjects the Company to restrictions on its business activities and obligates the Company to generally operate its businesses in the ordinary course in all material respects during the pendency of the Mergers. These restrictions could prevent the Company from pursuing attractive business opportunities that arise prior to the completion of the Mergers and are outside the ordinary course of business, and could otherwise have an adverse effect on ERI\u2019s and Isle\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nDelay or failure to complete the Mergers would prevent the Company from realizing the anticipated benefits of the Mergers and each company would also remain liable for significant transaction costs, including legal, accounting and financial advisory fees.\nAny delay in completing the Mergers may reduce the synergies and other benefits anticipated by the Company if it successfully completes the Mergers within the expected timeframe and integrates the businesses of the Company and Isle. In addition, the market price of each company\u2019s common stock may reflect various market assumptions as to whether and when the Mergers will be completed. Consequently, the completion of, the failure to complete, or any delay in the completion of the Mergers could result in significant changes in the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock. In addition, the Company has incurred and will continue to incur significant costs relating to the Mergers, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees that will be required to be paid whether or not the Mergers are consummated. Further, the Company may be required to pay a termination fee depending on the circumstances surrounding the termination.\nWhether or not the Mergers are completed, the pendency of the transaction could cause disruptions in the businesses of the Company, which could have an adverse effect on its businesses and financial results.\nThese disruptions could include the following:\n\u2022\ncurrent and prospective employees of the Company may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company or consider other employment alternatives, which might adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to retain or attract key managers and other employees;\n\u2022\ncurrent and prospective customers of the Company may anticipate changes in how they are served or the benefits offered by the Company\u2019s loyalty reward program and may, as a result, choose to discontinue their patronage of the Company; and\n\u2022\nthe attention of management of the Company may be diverted from the operation of its business.\nObtaining required approvals and satisfying closing conditions may delay or prevent completion of the Mergers and may significantly reduce the benefits anticipated to be realized from the Mergers or could adversely affect the market price of the Company or its future business and financial results.\nCompletion of the Mergers is subject to various closing conditions, including (a) Isle\u2019s stockholders adopting the Merger Agreement, (b) ERI\u2019s stockholders approving the issuance of ERI shares as consideration in the Mergers, (c) the approval or expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, (d) obtaining certain gaming approvals to the standards set forth in the Merger Agreement and (e) each of Isle and ERI\u2019s receipt of a tax opinion to the effect that the Mergers will be treated as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. If such conditions are not satisfied, the Mergers will not be consummated unless such conditions are validly waived. Such conditions may jeopardize or delay completion of the Mergers or may reduce the anticipated benefits of the Mergers. Further, no assurance can be given that the required consents and approvals will be obtained or that the required conditions to closing will be satisfied. Even if all such consents and approvals are obtained, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of the consents and approvals or that they will satisfy the terms of the Merger Agreement. On October 21, 2016, the waiting period under the HSR Act was terminated early by the Federal Trade Commission. The Company and Isle of Capri received approval adopting the Merger Agreement of each of their respective stockholders on January 25, 2017 at separate special meetings of stockholders.\nThe Mergers are subject to the receipt of approvals, consents or clearances that may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on ERI or, if not obtained, could prevent completion of the transactions.\nCompletion of the Mergers is conditioned upon the receipt of certain governmental approvals, including, without limitation, antitrust and gaming regulatory approvals. Although each party has agreed to use its respective reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite governmental approvals, there can be no assurance that these approvals will be obtained and that the other conditions to completing the Mergers will be satisfied. In addition, the governmental authorities from which the regulatory approvals are required may impose conditions on the completion of the Mergers or require changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement or other agreements to be entered into in connection with the Merger Agreement. Such conditions or changes and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying or impeding consummation of the Mergers or of imposing additional costs or limitations on ERI or Isle following completion of the Mergers, any of which might have an adverse effect on ERI or Isle.\nGaming regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or cannot be met.\nERI and Isle must obtain approval of the Mergers, which approvals must be duly obtained without the imposition of material restrictions or conditions and be in full force and effect, from a variety of gaming regulatory authorities. These approvals may not be received at all, may not be received in a timely fashion, and/or may contain conditions on the completion of the Mergers. In addition, these regulatory bodies may impose conditions on the granting of such approvals. Such conditions and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying completion of the Mergers or of imposing additional costs or limitations on ERI following the Mergers.\nIf the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter is not available, or alternative financing cannot be secured, the Mergers may not be completed and ERI may be required to pay a termination fee to Isle.\nERI intends to finance the cash required in connection with the Mergers, including expenses in connection with the Mergers, with debt financing in accordance with the terms of the Commitment Letter. The Commitment Letter provides for (a) a senior secured credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.75 billion comprised of (i) a term loan facility of up to $1.45 billion and (ii) a revolving credit facility of $300.0 million and (b) an amount equal to at least $375.0 million in gross proceeds from the issuance and sale by ERI of senior unsecured notes or, if the notes are not issued and sold on or prior to the date of the consummation of the Mergers, an amount equal to at least $375.0 million in senior unsecured bridge loans under a senior unsecured credit facility. In the event some or all of the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter is not available, ERI is obligated to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing from alternative institutions in an amount sufficient to enable ERI to consummate the Mergers, refinance the outstanding indebtedness of Isle described in the prior paragraph and pay all fees and expenses of Isle in connection with the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. If financing cannot be obtained, the Mergers may not be completed. If ERI is unable to obtain funding from its financing sources for the cash required in connection with the Mergers, and Isle is otherwise ready, willing and able to close the Mergers, ERI may be liable to Isle for a financing failure fee of $60.0 million or may be compelled to specifically perform its obligations to consummate the transaction.\nLitigation challenging the Mergers could delay or prevent the completion of the Mergers.\nOne of the conditions to the Mergers is that no temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction, or other judgment, order or decree issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the Mergers will be in effect; nor will there be any law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, order, policy, guideline or agency requirement enacted, entered, promulgated, enforced or deemed applicable by any governmental entity that prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Mergers. In connection with the Mergers, two class action lawsuits were filed by purported ERI stockholders alleging breach of fiduciary duty by the ERI board of directors in connection with the Mergers, one of which was dismissed. The pending lawsuit alleges, among other things, breach of fiduciary duty in failing to disclose all material information to ERI stockholders in seeking approval of the issuance of ERI shares in the Mergers and requests injunctive relief and an award of costs incurred by the plaintiffs in the actions. There can be no assurance that additional claims will not be filed by stockholders of ERI or Isle seeking damages relating to, or otherwise challenging, the Mergers. If the plaintiffs in any such action secure injunctive or other relief prohibiting, delaying or otherwise adversely affecting ERI\u2019s and Isle\u2019s ability to consummate the Mergers, then such injunctive or other relief may prevent the Mergers from becoming effective within the expected time frame or at all. If consummation of the Mergers is prevented or delayed, it could result in substantial costs to ERI and Isle. In addition, ERI and Isle could incur significant costs in connection with such lawsuits, including costs associated with the indemnification of ERI and Isle\u2019s directors and officers.\nThe integration of ERI and Isle following the Mergers may present significant challenges and impair ERI\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Mergers in the anticipated time frame or at all.\nERI\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Mergers will depend, to a large extent, on ERI\u2019s ability to integrate Isle\u2019s business into ERI in the anticipated time frame or at all. ERI may face significant challenges in combining Isle\u2019s operations into its operations in a timely and efficient manner. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, ERI will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of Isle into those of ERI. The integration process may disrupt the business and, if implemented ineffectively or inefficiently, would preclude realization of the full benefits expected by ERI and Isle. The failure to successfully integrate Isle into ERI and to manage the challenges presented by the integration process successfully may result in an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the business of ERI or Isle, which may have the effect of depressing the market price of ERI common stock following the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement).\nERI may be unable to realize anticipated cost synergies or may incur additional costs.\nERI expects to realize cost synergies from combining the sales and general and administrative functions of Isle and ERI. However, ERI will be required to incur costs, including severance and related expenses, to realize the anticipated cost savings. While ERI\u2019s management believes the combined entity will benefit from cost synergies, ERI may be unable to realize all of these cost synergies within the time frame expected or at all. In addition, ERI may incur additional or unexpected costs in order to realize these cost synergies.\nThe Mergers may not be accretive and may cause dilution to the combined company\u2019s earnings per share, which may negatively affect the price of the common stock of the combined company following completion of the Mergers.\nERI currently anticipates that the Mergers will be accretive to the earnings per share of the combined company in 2017. This expectation is based on preliminary estimates and assumes certain synergies expected to be realized by the combined company over a 12-month period following the completion of the Mergers and the previously announced dispositions of Isle of Capri Casino Hotel Lake Charles and Lady Luck Casino Marquette. Such estimates and assumptions could materially change due to additional transaction-related costs, delays in regulatory approvals, the failure to realize any or all of the benefits expected in the Mergers or other factors beyond the control of ERI. All of these factors could delay, decrease or eliminate the expected accretive effect of the Mergers and cause resulting dilution to the combined company\u2019s earnings per share or to the price of the common stock of the combined company.\nUnanticipated costs relating to the Mergers could reduce ERI\u2019s future earnings per share.\nWe believe that we have reasonably estimated the likely incremental costs of the combined operations of ERI and Isle following the Mergers. However, it is possible that unexpected transaction costs such as taxes, fees or professional expenses or unexpected future operating expenses such as unanticipated costs to integrate the two businesses, increased personnel costs or increased taxes, as well as other types of unanticipated adverse developments, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of ERI following the Mergers. In addition, if actual costs are materially different than expected costs, the Mergers could have a significant dilutive effect on ERI\u2019s earnings per share.\nERI will have a substantial amount of debt outstanding following the Mergers.\nERI expects that it will have approximately $2.2 billion of debt outstanding following the completion of the Mergers and related transactions. In addition, ERI expects that it will have the ability to incur additional debt under its $300.0 million revolving credit facility and may be required to incur additional indebtedness to finance the cash portion of the merger consideration if the sale of Isle of Capri Casino Hotel Lake Charles and/or the sale of Lady Luck Casino Marquette is not consummated prior to the closing of the Mergers. As a result of the increased levels of outstanding indebtedness following the Mergers, future interest expense and debt service obligations will be significantly higher than historic interest expense and the risks associated with its outstanding indebtedness will be intensified. Delay or failure to consummate the sale of the Isle of Capri Casino Hotel Lake Charles or the Lady Luck Casino Marquette may require ERI to incur additional debt to repay outstanding indebtedness of Isle or otherwise adversely impact the financial condition of the combined company.\nOn August 22, 2016, Isle entered into an agreement to sell Isle of Capri Casino Hotel Lake Charles for aggregate consideration of $134.5 million, subject to certain adjustments. On October 13, 2016, Isle entered into an agreement to sell Lady Luck Casino Marquette for cash consideration of approximately $40.0 million, subject to certain adjustments. The consummation of each transaction is subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, including receipt of regulatory approval, the accuracy of the representations and warranties, compliance with covenants, delivery of certain closing deliverables and the absence of any governmental order or action seeking to prohibit the consummation of the transaction. Although Isle expects the sale of Isle of Capri Casino Hotel Lake Charles to be consummated in Isle\u2019s early fiscal 2018, there can be no assurance as to the timing of the closing of either sale or that the closings will occur on the terms set forth in the purchase agreements relating to the sales, or at all. In the event that the closing of either sale is delayed or does not occur, ERI may be required to incur additional indebtedness to repay debt outstanding under Isle\u2019s credit agreement or outstanding notes, which could adversely impact the financial condition of the combined company.\nRisks Related to ERI\u2019s Capital Structure and Equity Ownership\nWe have significant indebtedness\nAs of December 31, 2016, we and our restricted subsidiaries had $822.6 million of total indebtedness outstanding consisting of $375.0 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 7.0% senior notes due 2023 (\u201cSenior Notes\u201d), our $425.0 million term loan (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d) and amounts outstanding under our $150.0 million revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d and, together with the Term Loan, the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d). We expect to incur approximately $1.8 billion of additional debt in order to complete the Mergers and related transactions. In addition, as of December 31, 2016 we had the ability to incur approximately $121.0 million of additional debt under our Revolving Credit Facility and we expect that we will have the ability to incur additional debt under the $300.0 million revolving credit facility that we expect to enter into in connection with the Mergers. Further, we may be required to incur additional indebtedness to finance the cash portion of the merger consideration if the sale of Isle of Capri Casino Hotel Lake Charles and/or the sale of Lady Luck Casino Marquette is not consummated prior to the closing of the Mergers. This indebtedness may have important negative consequences for us, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to satisfy our obligations;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to, and limiting our ability to react to, changing market conditions, changes in our industry and economic downturns;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service, general corporate or other obligations;\n\u2022\nsubjecting us to a number of restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to pay dividends and distributions, make acquisitions and dispositions, borrow additional funds, and make capital expenditures and other investments;\n\u2022\nrestricting our and our wholly-owned subsidiaries ability to make dividend payments and other payments;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of its business because we must dedicate a significant portion of these funds to make principal and/or interest payments on our outstanding debt;\n\u2022\nexposing us to interest rate risk due to the variable interest rate on borrowings under our Credit Facility;\n\u2022\ncausing our failure to comply with the financial and restrictive covenants contained in our current or future indebtedness, which could cause a default under such indebtedness and which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us; and\n\u2022\naffecting our ability to renew gaming and other licenses necessary to conduct our business.\nWe and our subsidiaries expect to incur substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the Isle Acquisition and may incur significant indebtedness in addition to the debt that we expect to incur in connection with the Isle Acquisition. Incurring more indebtedness could increase the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness\nWe and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. As of December 31, 2016, we had $121.0 million of borrowing availability under our Credit Facility and we had commitments for $1.75 billion of additional indebtedness that we expect to incur in connection with the Isle Acquisition. Our existing debt agreements currently permit, and we expect that agreements governing debt that we incur in the future will permit, us to incur certain other additional secured and unsecured debt. Further, we may incur other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness. The risks that we face based on our outstanding indebtedness may intensify if we incur additional indebtedness in the future, including as a result of the consummation of the Isle Acquisition.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. If our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. Additionally, the agreements governing our existing debt limit, and the agreements governing debt that we incur in the future, including debt incurred in connection with the Isle Acquisition, are expected to limit, the use of the proceeds from any disposition; as a result, we may not be allowed, under these documents, to use proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy all current debt service obligations.\nThe agreements governing our debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities\nThe agreements governing our existing debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and we expect that agreements governing debt that we incur in the future, including debt incurred in connection with the Isle Acquisition, are expected to impose similar restrictions. These restrictions limit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\ncreate liens or other encumbrances;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nagree to payment restrictions affecting our restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nprepay subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake investments, loans or other guarantees;\n\u2022\nsell or otherwise dispose of a portion of our assets; or\n\u2022\nmake acquisitions or merge or consolidate with another entity.\nIn addition, the credit agreement governing the Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants, including minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum total leverage ratio covenants, and we expect that the credit agreement that we enter into in connection with the Isle Acquisition will contain similar financial covenants.\nAs a result of these covenants and restrictions, we are limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The restrictions caused by such covenants could also place us at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors.\nA failure to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of the indebtedness and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If our indebtedness were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full. Moreover, in the event that such indebtedness is accelerated, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance it on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe are a holding company and will depend on our subsidiaries for dividends, distributions and repayment of our indebtedness\nWe are structured as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. Our only significant asset is the capital stock or other equity interests of our operating subsidiaries. As a holding company, we conduct all of our business through our subsidiaries. Consequently, our principal source of cash flow will be dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries. If our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments or distributions to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available, we may not be able to pay interest or principal on our indebtedness.\nThe market price of ERI\u2019s common stock could fluctuate significantly\nThe U.S. securities markets in general have experienced significant price fluctuations in recent years. The market price of ERI\u2019s common stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume of ERI\u2019s common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Some of the factors that could cause fluctuations in, or have a material adverse effect on, the stock price or trading volume of ERI\u2019s common stock include:\n\u2022\ngeneral market and economic conditions, including market conditions in the hotel and casino industries;\n\u2022\nactual or expected variations in operating results;\n\u2022\ndifferences between actual operating results and those expected by investors and analysts;\n\u2022\nchanges in recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\noperations and stock performance of competitors;\n\u2022\naccounting charges, including charges relating to the impairment of goodwill;\n\u2022\nsignificant acquisitions or strategic alliances by ERI or by competitors;\n\u2022\nsales of ERI\u2019s common stock or other securities in the future, including sales by our directors and officers or significant investors;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nconditions and trends in the gaming and entertainment industries;\n\u2022\nchanges in the estimate of the future size and growth of our markets; and\n\u2022\nchanges in reserves for professional liability claims.\nWe cannot assure you that the stock price of ERI common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. In addition, the stock market in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to ERI\u2019s performance. If the market price of ERI common stock fluctuates significantly, ERI may become the subject of securities class action litigation which may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nERI has not historically paid dividends a and may not pay dividends in the future\nERI does not currently expect to pay dividends on its common stock. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of the ERI board of directors and will depend upon among other factors, ERI\u2019s earnings, cash requirements, financial condition, requirements to comply with the covenants under its debt instruments, legal considerations, and other factors that the ERI board of directors deems relevant. In addition, the agreements governing ERI\u2019s indebtedness restrict its ability to pay dividends. If ERI does not pay dividends, then the return on an investment in its common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation in its stock price. There is no guarantee that ERI\u2019s common stock will appreciate in value or maintain its value.", "PERMNO": 14882, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "CZR"}
