{"cik": "1611231", "company": "MaxPoint Interactive, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, before investing in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects and may increase the risks associated with your investment.\nWe commenced operations in 2006 and, as a result, have only a limited operating history upon which our business and future prospects may be evaluated. Although we have experienced substantial revenue growth in recent years, we may not be able to sustain this rate of growth or even maintain our current revenue levels. Our rate of intra-quarter revenue growth declined in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to our rate of intra-quarter revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2014. We may not be able to slow or reverse this trend, and we may not be able to maintain our current revenue levels. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly developing and changing industries. Our business prospects will depend in large part on our ability to:\n\u2022\nbuild a reputation for a superior solution and create trust and long-term relationships with customers and advertising agencies;\n\u2022\ndistinguish ourselves from competitors in our industry;\n\u2022\noffer a competitive technology platform;\n\u2022\ndevelop additional product and service offerings that meet our customers\u2019 evolving needs;\n\u2022\nmaintain and expand our relationships with the RTB exchanges and other programmatic or direct media sources through which we execute our customers\u2019 digital marketing campaigns;\n\u2022\nrespond to evolving industry standards and government regulations that impact our business, particularly in the areas of data collection and consumer privacy;\n\u2022\nprevent or otherwise mitigate failures or breaches of security or privacy;\n\u2022\nexpand our business internationally; and\n\u2022\nattract, hire, integrate and retain qualified and motivated employees.\nWe may need to adapt our current operations to scale our business and achieve long-term profitability. If we are unable to meet one or more of these objectives or fail to implement these changes effectively and on a timely basis, or if we are unable to implement them at all, our revenue may decline, we may not be able to achieve further growth or long-term profitability and our business may suffer.\nWe expect the future growth rate of our revenues to decline.\nIn our fiscal years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, our total revenues grew by 88%, 61% and 32%, respectively, as compared to total revenues from the prior fiscal years. In our fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2015, our total revenues grew by 6% as compared to the same quarterly period from our prior fiscal year. We expect the growth rate of our revenues to decline in future periods which may adversely impact the value of our common stock.\nWe have a history of losses, we expect our operating expenses to continue to increase substantially and we may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nWe incurred net losses of $0.2 million, $13.0 million and $22.5 million in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $51.3 million. Although our revenue has increased significantly in recent years, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability or this revenue growth rate. In addition, our operating expenses have increased and we expect our traffic acquisition costs and operating expenses to continue to increase as we expand our business. If we do not achieve and sustain profitability, our revenue growth rate declines or our expenses exceed expectations, our financial performance will be adversely affected.\nIf the MaxPoint Intelligence Platform does not accurately predict the most likely local buyers for specific products, we could lose revenue, which would have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur solution depends on the ability of the MaxPoint Intelligence Platform to accurately predict the most likely communities of local buyers for specific products and to serve advertisements for those products to those communities. We do not have long-term commitments from our customers and it is relatively easy for our customers or the advertising agencies acting on their behalf to seek alternative providers of digital marketing solutions, as there are no significant switching costs. Thus, we must continuously deliver satisfactory results for our customers to maintain or increase revenue, which depends in part on the continued performance of the MaxPoint Intelligence Platform. Our failure to continuously innovate and improve on the algorithms underlying the MaxPoint Intelligence Platform could result in poor performance, which could in turn result in our customers ceasing to use our solution, which would have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur operating results and key metrics fluctuate, which make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below analysts\u2019 and investors\u2019 expectations.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results and key metrics have fluctuated in the past, and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. These fluctuations could cause our performance to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, and adversely affect the price of our common stock. Because our business is evolving rapidly, our historical operating results and key metrics may not be useful in predicting our future operating results. Factors that may increase the volatility of our operating results and key metrics include the factors set forth in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, as well as the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in the economic prospects of our customers or the economy generally, which could alter current or prospective customers\u2019 spending priorities, or increase the time or costs required to complete sales;\n\u2022\nchanges in demand for and pricing of our MaxPoint Intelligence Platform;\n\u2022\nthe impact of macroeconomic factors and seasonality on our customers\u2019 businesses and budgets for digital marketing campaigns, particularly our consumer product and retail customers;\n\u2022\nunpredictable sales cycles;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies, or the pricing policies of our competitors, RTB exchanges or other third-party service providers;\n\u2022\nthe addition or loss of customers;\n\u2022\nthe growth or reduction of business with current customers or advertising agencies that act on their behalf;\n\u2022\nchanges in our customers\u2019 advertising budget allocations, agency affiliations or marketing strategies;\n\u2022\nchanges and uncertainty in the regulatory environment for us or our customers;\n\u2022\nchanges in the availability of media inventory through RTB exchanges;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new technologies, products or service offerings by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in our operating expenses and capital expenditures; and\n\u2022\ncosts related to acquisitions of people, businesses or technologies.\nBased upon all of the factors described above, many of which are beyond our control, and others that we may not anticipate, we have a limited ability to forecast our future revenue, costs and expenses, and as a result, our operating results may fall below our estimates or the expectations of securities analysts and investors.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers, if our existing customers do not allocate a greater portion of their marketing spend to us, or if we are unable to further penetrate new industries, our revenue growth will be adversely affected.\nTo sustain or increase our revenue, we must add new customers and encourage existing customers to allocate a greater portion of their marketing spend to us. As the digital advertising industry matures and competitors introduce lower cost or differentiated products or services, our ability to sell our solution could be impaired. Even after a successful digital marketing campaign or series of campaigns with an existing customer, we frequently must compete to win further business from that customer. We may reach a point of saturation where we cannot continue to grow our revenue from existing customers because of, among other things, internal limits that they may place on their advertising budgets for digital media, particular digital marketing campaigns, local advertising or a particular provider. If we are unable to attract new customers or obtain new business from existing customers, our revenue, growth and business will be adversely affected.\nHistorically, we have focused primarily on serving national brands in three industries: consumer products, retail and automotive. We have also expanded into four other industries: financial services, healthcare, telecommunications and entertainment. Our plan is to continue to penetrate these industries and pursue opportunities in additional industries. If we are unable to continue to penetrate our existing industries and to penetrate new industries successfully, our revenue, growth and business will be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to develop new solutions and services or enhance our existing solution and services, we may not attract and retain customers, and our revenue and results of operations may decline.\nWe compete for customers that want to execute digital marketing campaigns. Our industry is subject to rapid changes in standards, technologies, products and service offerings, as well as advertiser expectations. We continuously need to invest in our technology and research and development to develop new solutions and services and enhance our existing solution and services to meet advertiser demands and respond to industry changes. New customer demands, superior competitive offerings or new industry standards could render our existing solution unattractive, unmarketable or obsolete and require us to make substantial changes to our technology platform or business model. Our failure to adapt to a rapidly changing market or to anticipate customer demand could harm our business and our financial performance.\nIf we do not manage our growth effectively, the quality of our solution may suffer, and our operating results may be negatively affected.\nWe continue to experience growth in our headcount and operations, which will continue to place significant demands on our management, operational and financial infrastructure. To manage our growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our infrastructure, including our IT systems, financial and administrative systems and controls. We must also continue to manage our employees, operations, finances, research and development and capital investments efficiently. Our productivity and the quality of our solution may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees, particularly our sales and account management personnel, quickly and effectively. If we continue our growth, we may incur significant additional expenses, and our growth may continue to strain our management, resources, infrastructure and ability to maintain the quality of our solution. If the current and future members of our management team do not effectively scale with our growth, the quality of our solution may suffer and our corporate culture may be harmed. Failure to manage our future growth effectively could cause our business to suffer, which, in turn, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nTechnologies have been developed that may block the display of our advertisements, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nTechnologies have been developed, and will likely continue to be developed, that may block the display of our advertisements, particularly advertising displayed on personal computers and mobile platforms. Revenue generated from the display of advertisements on personal computers and mobile platforms may be impacted by these technologies from time to time. As a result, these technologies may have an adverse effect on our financial results in the future.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, which may result in declining revenue or inability to grow our business.\nCompetition for our customers\u2019 advertising budgets is intense, and we expect competition to increase in the future with more advertising occurring online.\nWe compete with traditional local marketing channels, which include television, newspaper, magazine and radio advertising, as well as mailers, free-standing inserts and coupons. Our competition in these channels includes traditional advertising and direct marketing companies, such as Gannett Company, Inc., The McClatchy Company, News America Marketing, Valassis Communications, Inc. and Valpak Direct Marketing Systems, Inc.\nWe also compete or may compete with online/digital local marketing channels or traditional national channels with localized offerings, including:\n\u2022\ncompanies that offer demand-side platforms that allow customers to purchase inventory directly from RTB exchanges or other third parties;\n\u2022\nadvertising networks and advertising agencies, including agency trading desks;\n\u2022\ndigital services offered through large online platforms, such as Yahoo! Inc. and Google Inc.;\n\u2022\ndigital advertising services offered by other companies, including those owned by traditional advertising and direct marketing companies;\n\u2022\nin-house solutions used by our customers;\n\u2022\nERP vendors such as Adobe, Oracle, Salesforce.com and IBM;\n\u2022\ncompanies providing online search advertising, for which we do not offer a solution; and\n\u2022\ntechnology companies providing online marketing platforms focused on local businesses.\nMany current and potential competitors have advantages, such as longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, greater access to media inventory, more access to Internet user data and significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources. Increased competition may result in reduced pricing for our solution, longer sales cycles or a decrease of our market share, any of which could negatively affect our revenue and future operating results and our ability to grow our business.\nWe have historically relied, and expect to continue to rely, on a small number of customers for a substantial majority of our revenue, and the loss of any of these customers may significantly harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur customers are primarily enterprises with national brands in a number of industries. We sell our solution either directly to our customers or through advertising agencies that act on behalf of our customers. A relatively small number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial majority of our revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 36%, 30% and 29% of our revenue, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, no single customer represented more than 10% of our revenue. We expect that we will continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a substantial majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future while we continue to broaden our customer base. As a result, if we fail to successfully attract or retain customers, or if existing customers reduce or delay their marketing spend with us, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed. Moreover, a significant portion of our customers\u2019 products are purchased at a limited number of large national retailers. Any material decline in these customers\u2019 sales at the physical retail locations of these large national retailers may adversely impact our business.\nWe rely on advertising agencies that act on behalf of our customers for a substantial majority of our revenue. The loss of any such relationships or increased competition from such advertising agencies or agency trading desks could materially harm our business.\nWe rely on advertising agencies that act on behalf of our customers for a substantial majority of our revenue. Multiple advertising agencies operating within two global advertising networks represented numerous customers accounting for approximately 17% and 13% of our revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, for reasons specific to individual agencies, some agencies may not recommend us to the national brands they represent, even if our solution is more effective than alternative solutions. Certain of those agencies have created or are creating their own competitive solutions, referred to as agency trading desks. Agency trading desks are independent units within agency holding companies that centralize the buying and optimization of programmatic or biddable media to serve advertising agencies within the holding company. If agency trading desks are successful in leveraging agency relationships with our customers or agencies assist our customers in transitioning to other self-service platforms, we may be unable to compete successfully even if our solution is more effective. In addition, agencies are increasingly helping the advertisers they represent select self-service platforms.\nWe have been named as a party to a lawsuit and we may be named in additional litigation in the future.\nWe have been named as a party in a lawsuit described under \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and we may be named in additional litigation in the future, all of which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price for our securities. Under certain circumstances, we have contractual and other legal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of current and former directors and officers, and on behalf of our current or former underwriters, in connection with the litigation described in \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and in connection with any future lawsuits. The ultimate outcome of the litigation described in \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d, and any future litigation, may have a material adverse effect on our business and the trading price for our securities. Litigation may be time-consuming, expensive, and disruptive to normal business operations, and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict. The defense of the litigation described in \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d, and any future lawsuits, may result in significant expenditures and the continued diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention from the operation of our business, which could impede our business. In the event we were to receive an unfavorable outcome in any lawsuit, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities may be materially and adversely affected.\nLegal claims resulting from the actions of our customers could damage our reputation and be costly to defend.\nWe do not independently verify whether the content of the advertisements we deliver is legally permitted. We typically receive representations from customers that the content of the advertising that we place on their behalf is lawful. We also rely on representations from our customers that they maintain adequate privacy policies that allow us to place cookies and other tracking mechanisms on their websites and collect data from users that visit those websites to aid in delivering our solution. If any of these representations are untrue and our customers do not abide by federal, state, local or foreign laws governing their content or privacy practices we may become subject to legal claims, we will be exposed to potential liability (for which we may or may not be indemnified), and our reputation may be damaged.\nIndemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses.\nOur agreements with customers and other third parties may include indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, damages caused by us to property or persons, or other liabilities relating to or arising from our solution or other contractual obligations. The term of these indemnity provisions generally survives termination or expiration of the applicable agreement. Large indemnity payments could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nPotential \u201cDo Not Track\u201d standards or government regulation could negatively impact our business by limiting our access to the anonymous user data that the MaxPoint Intelligence Platform uses to predict local purchase demand and execute the digital marketing campaigns we run, and as a result may degrade our performance for our customers, which, in turn, may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs the use of cookies has received ongoing media attention over the past several years, some government regulators and privacy advocates have suggested creating a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d standard that would allow Internet users to express a preference, independent of cookie settings in their web browser, not to have their website browsing history recorded. All the major Internet browsers have implemented some version of a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d setting. In the past, Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer 10 included a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d setting that was selected \u201con\u201d by default. However, there is no definition of \u201ctracking,\u201d no consensus regarding what message is conveyed by a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d setting and no industry standards regarding how to respond to a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d preference. It is possible that we could face competing policy standards, or standards that put our business model at a competitive disadvantage to other companies that collect data from Internet users and may not be required to adhere to a Do Not Track policy standard, standards that reduce the effectiveness of our solution, or standards that require us to make costly changes to our solution. The Federal Trade Commission has stated that it will pursue a legislative solution if the industry cannot agree upon a standard. The \u201cDo-Not-Track Online Act of 2013\u201d was introduced in the United States Senate in February 2013. If a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d web browser setting is adopted by many Internet users, and the standard either imposed by state or federal legislation, or agreed upon by standard setting groups, requires us to recognize a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signal and prohibits us from using non-personal data as we currently do, then that could hinder growth of advertising and content production on the web generally, and limit the quality and amount of data we are able to store and use, which would cause us to change our business practices and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nLegislation and regulation of online businesses, including privacy and data protection regimes, could create unexpected costs, subject us to enforcement actions for compliance failures, or cause us to change our technology platform or business model, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nGovernment regulation could increase the costs of doing business online. U.S. and foreign governments have enacted or are considering enacting legislation related to online advertising, and we expect to see an increase in legislation and regulation related to advertising online, the use of geo-location data to inform advertising, the collection and use of anonymous Internet user data and unique device identifiers, such as IP address or unique mobile device identifiers, and other data protection and privacy regulation. Recent revelations about bulk online data collection by the National Security Agency, and news articles suggesting that the National Security Agency may gather data from cookies placed by Internet advertisers to deliver interest-based advertising, may further interest governments in legislation regulating data collection by commercial entities, such as advertisers, publishers and technology companies that serve the advertising industry. Such legislation could affect the costs of doing business online and could reduce the demand for our solutions or otherwise harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, a wide variety of provincial, state, national and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data. While we have not collected data that is traditionally considered personal data by U.S. regulators, such as name, email address, address, phone numbers, social security numbers, credit card numbers, financial or health data, we typically do collect and store IP addresses and other device identifiers, that are or may be considered personal data in some jurisdictions or otherwise may be the subject of legislation or regulation. Evolving and changing definitions of personal data, within the EU, the United States and elsewhere, especially relating to classification of IP addresses, machine or device identifiers, location data and other information, have in the past, and could in the future, cause us to change our business practices or limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business. Data protection and privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and could result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. While we take measures to protect the security of information that we collect, use and disclose in the operation of our business, and to offer certain privacy protections with respect to that information, our measures may not always be effective. In addition, while we take steps to avoid collecting personally identifiable information about consumers, we may inadvertently receive this information from advertisers or advertising agencies or through the process of delivering advertising. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or to protect personal data, could result in enforcement action against us, including fines, imprisonment of our officers and public censure, claims for damages by consumers and other affected individuals, damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, could harm our reputation and inhibit adoption of our solutions by current and future advertisers and advertising agencies.\nOur ability to generate revenue depends on our collection of significant amounts of data from various sources.\nOur ability to deliver our business intelligence and marketing automation software solution depends on our ability to successfully leverage significant amounts of data, including data that we collect from our customers and acquire from third parties, as well as raw data captured by our proprietary consumer purchase intent model. The foundation of our local targeting is our proprietary Digital Zip architecture, a digital grid of households organized into specific neighborhoods, or Digital Zips. We have approximately 44,000, 39,000 and 5,300 Digital Zips in the United States, Europe and Canada, respectively. We create a profile for each Digital Zip by using third-party data and proprietary data captured by our consumer purchase intent model, including IP addresses and consumer online browsing data, and any limit to our access or use of these types of data could impact our ability to match the most likely community of local buyers with specific products, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to successfully execute our customers\u2019 digital marketing campaigns on a real-time basis. Our customers often share with us enterprise data, such as point of sale and spending information, and certain customers provide us with supply chain management and customer relationship management data. If our enterprise customers do not share their data, our ability to scale and provide our solution could be adversely affected. In addition, our ability to successfully leverage vast amounts of data is dependent upon our continued ability to access and utilize up-to-date data. Our ability to access and use such data could be restricted by a number of factors, including consumer choice, restrictions imposed by our customers, changes in technology and new developments in laws, regulations and industry standards. If the data we utilize is out-of-date or stale, our predictions, recommendations and business intelligence will be ineffective and our reputation will suffer. Further, we sometimes use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to deliver our solution, and certain web browsers, including Safari, currently block or are planning to block some or all third-party cookies by default. As a result, we could be blocked from serving advertisements on the basis of cookies to users that utilize web browsers that block third-party cookies. Any limitation on our ability to collect data would make it more difficult for us to deliver effective solutions that meet the needs of national brands. This, in turn, could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe may experience outages and disruptions of our services or experience data security incidents if we fail to maintain adequate security and supporting infrastructure our systems, which may harm our brand and reputation, result in regulatory enforcement, actions or litigation and negatively impact our revenue and results of operations.\nCreating the appropriate support for our technology platform, including storing large amounts of data and managing our computational infrastructure, is expensive and complex, and our failure to create and maintain such support, particularly as we scale our system to support the growth in our business, could result in operational inefficiencies, disruptions or failures and increased vulnerability to cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks could diminish the quality of our services and our performance for customers. Cyber-attacks could include denial-of-service attacks impacting service availability (including the ability to deliver advertisements) and reliability; the exploitation of software vulnerabilities in Internet-facing applications; social engineering of system administrators (tricking company employees into releasing control of their systems to a hacker) or the introduction of computer viruses or malware into our systems with a view to steal confidential or proprietary data. Cyber-attacks of increasing sophistication may be difficult to detect and could result in the theft of our intellectual property and our data or our customers\u2019 data. In addition, we are vulnerable to unintentional errors or malicious actions by persons with authorized access to our systems that exceed the scope of their access rights, or unintentionally or intentionally alter parameters or otherwise interfere with the intended operations of our platform. The steps we take to increase the reliability, integrity and security of our systems as they scale may be expensive and may not prevent system failures or unintended vulnerabilities resulting from the increasing number of persons with access to our systems, complex interactions within our technology platform, the increasing number of connections with third-party partners and vendors\u2019 technology and the increasing volume of data analyzed by our systems. If we experience a security incident involving consumer data, or we do not comply with legal requirements or industry standards concerning data security, we could face regulatory enforcement actions or private litigation. Operational errors or failures or successful cyber-attacks also could result in damage to our reputation and loss of customers and other business partners which could harm our business. In addition, we could be adversely impacted by outages and disruptions in the online platforms of our key business partners, such as the RTB exchanges, which we rely upon for access to inventory.\nWe use co-location facilities to deliver our services. Any disruption of service at these facilities could harm our business.\nWe maintain servers at co-location facilities in San Jose, California; Santa Clara, California; Somerset, New Jersey; Morrisville, North Carolina; Austin, Texas; Ashburn, Virginia; and Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and expect to add other data centers at co-location facilities in the future. Although we control the actual computers, networks and storage systems upon which our platform runs, and deploy them to the data center facilities, we do not control the operation of the facilities. The owners of the facilities have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew our agreements on commercially reasonable terms, we may be required to transfer to a new facility or facilities, and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with doing so.\nThe facilities are vulnerable to damage or service interruption resulting from human error, intentional bad acts, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires, war, terrorist attacks, power losses, hardware failures, systems failures, telecommunications failures and similar events. The occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, any outages or vandalism or other misconduct, or a decision to close the facility without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. If we were to lose the data stored in any of our co-location facilities, it could take several days, if not weeks, to recreate this data from multiple sources, which could result in significant negative impact on our business operations, and potential damage to our customer and advertising agency relationships. Our facilities would likely be costly to repair or replace, and any such efforts would likely require substantial time.\nAny changes in service levels at the co-location facilities or any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems at or related to the facilities that affect our services could harm our reputation and may damage our customers\u2019 businesses. Interruptions in our services might reduce our revenue, subject us to potential liability, or result in reduced usage of our platform.\nWe also depend on third-party Internet-hosting providers and continuous and uninterrupted access to the Internet through third-party bandwidth providers to operate our business. If we lose the services of one or more of our Internet-hosting or bandwidth providers for any reason or if their services are disrupted, for example due to viruses or \u201cdenial-of-service\u201d or other attacks on their systems, or due to human error, intentional bad acts, power loss, hardware failures, telecommunications failures, fires, wars, terrorist attacks, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes or similar events, we could experience disruption in our ability to offer our solution or we could be required to retain the services of replacement providers, which could increase our operating costs and harm our business and reputation.\nChanges in market standards applicable to our solution could require us to incur substantial additional development costs.\nMarket forces, competitors\u2019 initiatives, regulatory authorities, industry organizations and security protocols are causing the emergence of demands and standards that are or could be applicable to our solution. We expect compliance with these kinds of standards to become increasingly important to our customers and the consumers they sell their products to, and conforming to these standards is expected to consume a substantial and increasing portion of our development resources. If our solution is not consistent with emerging standards, our market position and sales could be impaired. If we fail to conform with these standards, we will be at a disadvantage to our competitors, and we may face regulatory enforcement actions or private litigation.\nOur historical revenue growth has masked seasonal fluctuations in advertising activity. As growth declines or seasonal patterns become more pronounced, seasonality could have a material impact on our results.\nWe expect our revenue, operating results, cash flow from operations and other key operating and performance metrics to vary from quarter to quarter in part due to the seasonal nature of our customers\u2019 spending on digital marketing campaigns. For example, many advertisers tend to devote a significant portion of their advertising budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year to coincide with consumer holiday spending. Moreover, media inventory in the fourth quarter may be more expensive due to increased demand for media inventory. Our historical revenue growth has partially masked the impact of seasonality, but if our growth rate declines or seasonal spending by our customers on marketing campaigns becomes more pronounced, seasonality could have a material impact on our revenue, operating results, cash flow from operations and other key operating and performance metrics from period-to-period.\nWe do not have long-term commitments from our customers, and we may not be able to retain customers or attract new customers to sustain or grow current revenue.\nMost of our customers do business with us by placing insertion orders for particular digital marketing campaigns, either directly or through advertising agencies that act on their behalf. We rarely have any commitment from a customer beyond the campaign governed by a particular insertion order, and we frequently must compete to win further business from a customer. In accordance with the Interactive Advertising Bureau our insertion orders may also be cancelled by customers or their advertising agencies prior to the completion of the campaign without penalty. As a result, our success is dependent upon our ability to outperform our competitors and win repeat business from existing customers, while continually expanding the number of customers for which we provide services. Because we do not have long-term agreements, we may not accurately predict future revenue streams, and we cannot guarantee that our current customers will continue to use our solution, or that we will be able to replace departing customers with new customers that provide us with comparable revenue.\nIf mobile connected devices, their operating systems or content distribution channels, including those controlled by our competitors, develop in ways that prevent our digital marketing campaigns from being delivered to the users of these devices, our ability to grow our business will be impaired.\nOur success in the mobile channel depends upon the continued ability of our technology platform to integrate with mobile inventory suppliers and provide advertising for most mobile connected devices, as well as integrate with the major operating systems that run on them and the thousands of applications that are downloaded onto them. The design of mobile devices and operating systems is controlled by third parties with which we do not have any formal relationships. These parties frequently introduce new devices, and from time to time they may introduce new operating systems or modify existing ones. Technologies have been developed, and will likely continue to be developed, that can block the display of our advertisements, in particular with respect to mobile platforms. Network carriers may also impact the ability to access specified content on mobile devices. If our solution is or becomes unable to work on these devices or operating systems, either because of technological constraints or because a maker of these devices or developer of these operating systems wishes to impair our ability to provide advertisements on them, our ability to generate revenue could be significantly harmed.\nThe digital advertising market is relatively new and dependent on growth in various digital advertising channels. If this market develops more slowly or differently than we expect, our business, growth prospects and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nThe digital advertising market is relatively new and our solution may not achieve or sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. The future growth of our business depends not only on the growth of the digital display advertising market, but also the expansion of other digital advertising channels and our ability to gain market share within those channels. In addition, our growth will depend on the increased adoption by the advertising industry of automation in lieu of manual operations for order placement. Any expansion of the market for digital advertising solutions depends on a number of factors and the cost, performance and perceived value associated with digital advertising solutions. If demand for digital display advertising, the expansion of other digital advertising channels and adoption of advertising automation does not continue to grow, or if digital advertising solutions or advertising automation do not achieve widespread adoption, our revenue and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe currently depend on display advertising. A decrease in the use of display advertising, or our inability to further penetrate display, mobile, social and video advertising channels would harm our business, growth prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nHistorically, our customers have predominantly used our solution for display advertising, and the substantial majority of our revenue is derived from advertisers, typically through their agencies, that use our solution for display advertising. We expect that display advertising will continue to be a significant channel for our customers. If our customers were to lose confidence in the value or effectiveness of display advertising, the demand for our solution may decline. In addition, our failure to achieve market acceptance of our solution for mobile, social and video advertising would harm our growth prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nOur international expansion subjects us to additional costs and risks, may not yield returns in the foreseeable future, and may not be successful.\nCurrently, we have operations in the United Kingdom, which began in 2014. While non-U.S. operations are not currently material, we expect to expand our international operations in the future, and our limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future expansion efforts that we may undertake will not be successful.\nOur international expansion presents challenges and risks to our business and requires significant attention from our management, finance, analytics, operations, sales and engineering teams to support digital marketing campaigns abroad. We may incur significant operating expenses as a result of our international expansion, and it may not be successful. Compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business abroad, may interfere with our ability to offer our solution competitively to customers in one or more countries, or at all, and may expose us or our employees to fines and penalties. Laws and regulations that may impact us include tax laws, employment laws, regulations related to data privacy and security, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and private entities, such as the U.K. Bribery Act. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in monetary damages, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business.\nOur international business also subjects us to the impact of global and regional recessions and economic and political instability, costs and difficulties in managing a distributed workforce, potentially adverse tax consequences in the United States and abroad and restrictions on the repatriation of funds to the United States. Our failure to manage these risks and challenges successfully could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to detect fraud or if we serve our customers\u2019 advertisements on objectionable websites, our brand and reputation will suffer, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends in part on providing our customers with a service that they trust, and we have contractual commitments to take reasonable measures to prevent customers\u2019 advertisements from appearing on undesirable websites or on certain websites that they identify. We use proprietary technology to detect click fraud and block inventory that we suspect to be fraudulent. We also use third-party services in an effort to prevent our customers\u2019 advertisements from appearing on undesirable websites. Preventing and combating fraud requires constant vigilance, and we may not always be successful in our efforts to do so. We may serve advertising on web sites that is objectionable to our customers, and we may lose the trust of our customers, which would harm our brand and reputation and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also purchase inventory inadvertently that proves to be unacceptable for digital marketing campaigns, such as advertising inventory on objectionable or undesirable websites, in which case we would be responsible for the cost and could not bill that cost to any customer.\nOur revenue could decline and our growth could be impeded if our access to quality media inventory or impressions is diminished or if we fail to acquire new media inventory or impressions.\nOur success depends on our ability to secure quality media inventory on reasonable terms across a broad range of advertising networks and exchanges, including RTB exchanges, such as Rubicon Project, Google\u2019s DoubleClick Ad Exchange, PubMatic, MoPub and AppNexus, as well as suppliers of video and mobile inventory.\nThe amount, quality and cost of inventory and impressions available to us can change at any time. For the year ended December 31, 2015, five RTB exchanges each provided 10% or more of our total impression purchases. These five exchanges together accounted for approximately 93% of our total impression purchases, with the largest exchange accounting for approximately 27%. If we are not able to access the impressions on any of these exchanges due to a change in our relationship with that exchange or the exchange\u2019s financial difficulty, our revenue could decline and growth could be impeded.\nOur media inventory suppliers are generally not bound by long-term agreements. As a result, there is no guarantee that we will have access to a consistent supply of quality inventory. Moreover, the number of competing intermediaries that purchase advertising inventory from RTB exchanges continues to increase, which could put upward pressure on inventory costs. If we are unable to compete favorably for media inventory available on RTB exchanges, or if RTB exchanges decide not to make their media inventory available to us, we may not be able to place advertisements at competitive rates or find alternative sources of inventory with comparable traffic patterns and consumer demographics in a timely manner.\nSuppliers control the real-time bidding process for the inventory they supply, and their processes may not always work in our favor. For example, suppliers may place restrictions on the use of their inventory, including prohibiting the placement of advertisements on behalf of certain customers. Through the bidding process, we may not win the media inventory that we have selected and may not be able to replace media inventory that is no longer made available to us. Moreover, any material changes to, or the disappearance of, the real-time bidding ecosystem could negatively impact our business by limiting our ability to target and selectively purchase impressions.\nIf we are unable to maintain a consistent supply of quality media inventory for any reason, our business, customer retention and loyalty, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nOur sales and marketing efforts require significant investment, which may not yield returns in the foreseeable future, if at all.\nWe have invested significant resources in our sales and marketing teams to educate potential and prospective customers, either directly or through the advertising agencies that act on their behalf, about the value of our solution. We are often required to explain how our solution can optimize digital marketing campaigns in real time. We often spend substantial time and resources responding to requests for proposals from potential customers or their advertising agencies, including developing material specific to the needs of such potential customers. We may not be successful in attracting new customers despite our investment in our business development, sales and marketing organizations.\nOur sales cycle can be unpredictable, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate.\nThe sales cycle for our solution, from initial contact with a potential lead to agreement execution and implementation, varies widely by customer, and typically ranges from one to six months. Some of our customers undertake an evaluation process that involves not only our solution but also those of our competitors, which can delay purchase decisions. Our sales efforts involve educating our customers about the use, technical capabilities and benefits of our solution. If sales expected from a customer are not realized in the time period expected or not realized at all, or if a customer terminates its agreement with us, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf we do not effectively grow and train our sales team, we may be unable to add new customers or increase sales to our existing customers and our business will be adversely affected.\nWe continue to be substantially dependent on our sales team to obtain new customers and to drive sales from our existing customers. We believe that there is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. Our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training, integrating and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth. New hires require significant training and it may take significant time before they achieve full productivity. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business. If we are unable to hire and train sufficient numbers of effective sales personnel, or the sales personnel are not successful in obtaining new customers or increasing sales to our existing customer base, either directly or through advertising agencies that act on their behalf, our business will be adversely affected.\nEconomic downturns and political and market conditions beyond our control could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for advertising and on the economic health of the national brands that are our current and prospective customers. Economic downturns or instability in political or market conditions may cause current or new customers to reduce their advertising budgets or choose lower cost alternative providers. Adverse economic conditions and general uncertainty about economic recovery are likely to affect our business prospects. Concern over such downturns or economic recovery could cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our solution; and expose us to increased credit risk on customer orders, which, in turn, could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, concern over continued geopolitical turmoil in many parts of the world have and may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions, which could lead to reduced spending on advertising.\nFailure to comply with industry self-regulation could harm our reputation and our business.\nWe have committed to complying with the Network Advertising Initiative\u2019s Code of Conduct and the Digital Advertising Alliance\u2019s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising in the United States, as well as similar self-regulatory principles in Europe adopted by the Interactive Advertising Bureau-Europe and the European Digital Advertising Alliance. If we make mistakes in the future, or our opt-out mechanisms fail to work as designed, or if Internet users misunderstand our technology or our commitments with respect to these principles, we may, as a result, be subject to negative publicity, government investigation, government or private litigation, or investigation by self-regulatory bodies or other accountability groups. Any such action against us could be costly and time consuming, require us to change our business practices, cause us to divert management\u2019s attention and our resources and be damaging to our reputation and our business.\nReal or perceived errors or failures in our software and systems could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects and could cause us reputational harm.\nWe depend upon the sustained and uninterrupted performance of our technology platform to: operate over a thousand digital marketing campaigns at any given time; manage our inventory supply; bid on inventory for each campaign; serve or direct a third party to serve advertising; collect, process and interpret data; optimize campaign performance in real time and provide billing information to our financial systems. If our technology platform cannot scale to meet demand, or if there are errors in our execution of any of these functions on our platform, then our business may be harmed. Because our software is complex, undetected errors and failures may occur, especially when new versions or updates are made. We do not have the capability to test new releases or updates to our code on a small subset of digital marketing campaigns, which means that bugs or errors in code could impact all campaigns on our platform. Despite testing by us, errors or bugs in our software have in the past, and may in the future, not be found until the software is in our live operating environment. For example, we have experienced failures in our bidding system to recognize or respond to budget restrictions for digital marketing campaigns, resulting in overspending on media inventory, and we may in the future have failures in our systems that cause us to buy more media than our customers are contractually obligated to pay for, which could be costly and harm our operating results. Errors or failures in our software could also result in negative publicity, damage to our reputation, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our solution, increased costs or loss of revenue, loss of competitive position or claims by customers for losses sustained by them. In such an event, we may be required or choose to expend additional resources to help mitigate any problems resulting from errors in our software. We may make errors in the measurement of our digital marketing campaigns causing discrepancies with our customers\u2019 measurements leading to a lack in confidence in our technology platform. If measurement errors or discrepancies relate to marketing campaigns for which we have billed amounts to customers, we may have the need to provide the customer with \u201cmake-goods,\u201d or standard credits given to advertisers for campaigns that have not been delivered properly. Alleviating problems resulting from errors in our software could require significant expenditures of capital and other resources and could cause interruptions, delays or the cessation of our business, any of which would adversely impact our financial position, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur future success depends on the continuing efforts of our key employees, including our three founders, Joseph Epperson, Gretchen Joyce and Kurt Carlson, and on our ability to hire, retain and motivate additional key employees.\nOur future success depends heavily upon the continuing services of our key employees, including our three founders, Joseph Epperson, our president and chief executive officer, Gretchen Joyce, our chief operating officer, and Kurt Carlson, our chief technology officer, and on our ability to attract and retain members of our management team and other highly skilled employees, including software engineers, analytics and operations employees and sales professionals. The market for talent in our key areas of operations is intensely competitive. None of our founders or other key employees has an employment agreement for a specific term, and any of our employees may terminate his or her employment with us at any time.\nNew employees often require significant training and, in many cases, take significant time to achieve full productivity. As a result, we may incur significant costs to attract and retain employees, including salaries, benefits and compensation expenses related to equity awards, and we may lose new employees to our competitors or other companies before we realize the benefit of our investment in recruiting and training them. Moreover, new employees may not become as productive as we expect, as we may face challenges in adequately or appropriately integrating them into our workforce and culture. In addition, as we move into new geographies, we will need to attract and recruit skilled employees in those areas. We have little experience with recruiting outside of the United States, and may face additional challenges in attracting, integrating and retaining international employees. In addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the stock awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived value of our stock awards declines, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees.\nWe may require additional capital to support growth, and such capital might not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all, which may in turn hamper our growth and adversely affect our business.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new features or enhance our platform, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in additional public or private equity, equity-linked or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing that we secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, including the ability to pay dividends. This may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain it as we grow, we could lose the innovation, creativity and teamwork fostered by our culture, and our business may be harmed.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 395 employees in the United States and 11 employees in the United Kingdom, compared with 318 employees in the United States and five employees in the United Kingdom as of December 31, 2014. We intend to further expand our overall headcount and operations both domestically and internationally, with no assurance that we will be able to do so while effectively maintaining our corporate culture. We believe our corporate culture has been a critical component of our success as we believe it fosters innovation, teamwork, passion for customers and focus on execution, while facilitating knowledge sharing across our organization. As we grow and change, we may find it difficult to preserve our corporate culture, which could reduce our ability to innovate and operate effectively. In turn, the failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our ability to attract, recruit, integrate and retain employees, continue to perform at current levels and effectively execute our business strategy.\nWe rely on advertising agencies that act on behalf of our customers, and we incur the cost of a digital marketing campaign before we bill for our services. Potential delays in payment or non-payment could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nA substantial majority of our revenue is sourced through advertising agencies, which act as agents for disclosed principals that are the advertisers. Typically, the advertising agency pays for our services once it has received payment from the advertiser for our services. However, we are obligated to pay for media inventory we have purchased from RTB exchanges before receiving such payments from the advertising agency. This delay in payment, which is typically more prolonged than the delay in payment we experience when we bill advertisers directly, could negatively impact our liquidity and financial condition. Contracting with these agencies could subject us to greater liquidity risk than when we contract with advertisers directly and to credit risk if an agency is unable to pay us once paid by the advertiser. These risks may vary depending on the nature of an advertising agency\u2019s aggregated advertiser base and the related timing of payment to the agency by our customer. There can be no assurance that we will not experience significant delays in payment in the future. Our agreements with advertising agencies typically provide that if the advertiser does not pay the agency, the agency is not liable to us and we must seek payment solely from the advertiser. Any such delays in payment to the agency by our customer and any failure by the advertiser to pay the agency or the agency to pay us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nBecause we generally bill our customers over the term of the agreement, near-term declines in new or renewed agreements generating revenue may not be reflected immediately in our operating results.\nMost of our revenue in each quarter is derived from agreements entered into with our customers during the previous three months. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed customer agreements in any one quarter may not be fully reflected in our revenue for that quarter. Such declines, however, would negatively affect our revenue in future periods and the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our solution, and potential changes in our rate of renewals or renewal terms, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. In addition, we may be unable to adjust our cost structure rapidly enough, or at all, to take account of reduced revenue. Our business model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our total revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be earned over the applicable agreement term based on the value of their monthly advertising spend.\nFluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe anticipate international sales and operations to become an increasingly important part of our business. Such sales and operational expenses may be subject to unexpected regulatory requirements and other barriers. Any fluctuation in the exchange rates of these foreign currencies may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have not previously engaged in foreign currency hedging. If we decide to hedge our foreign currency exposure, we may not be able to hedge effectively due to lack of experience, unreasonable costs or illiquid markets. In addition, those activities may be limited in the protection they provide us from foreign currency fluctuations and can themselves result in losses.\nOur proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce, which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our solution without compensating us, thereby eroding our competitive advantages and harming our business.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to protect proprietary methods and technologies that we develop under the intellectual property laws of the United States, so that we can prevent others from using our inventions and proprietary information. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors might gain access to our technology, and our business might be adversely affected. We rely on trademark, copyright, trade secret and patent laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary methods and technologies. Our patent strategy is still in its early stages and while we have a small number of pending patent applications, valid patents may not be issued from our pending applications, and the claims eventually allowed on any patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or offerings and services. Any issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and any rights granted under these patents may not actually provide adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages to us. Additionally, the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. Additional uncertainty may result from changes to intellectual property legislation enacted in the United States, including the recent America Invents Act, and other national governments and from interpretations of the intellectual property laws of the United States and other countries by applicable courts and agencies. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to obtain adequate patent protection, or to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.\nUnauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our technology or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We generally enter into confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors and customers, and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. However, we cannot assure you that any steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology and proprietary information. Policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those of the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of our proprietary rights in such countries may be inadequate. From time to time, legal action by us may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of limited resources and could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights (including aspects of our technology platform) we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others that have not incurred the same level of expense, time and effort to create and protect their intellectual property.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property rights claims by third parties, which are extremely costly to defend, could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies.\nThird parties may assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights in proprietary technology against us or against our customers for which we may be liable or have an indemnification obligation. Any claim of infringement by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, limit our ability to use certain technologies and could distract our management from our business.\nAlthough such third parties may offer a license to their technology, the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business, results of operations or financial condition to be materially and adversely affected. In addition, some licenses may be non-exclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. Alternatively, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense and ultimately may not be successful. Furthermore, a successful claimant could secure a judgment or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from providing certain solutions or services or that requires us to pay substantial damages, including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed such claimant\u2019s patents or copyrights, royalties or other fees. Any of these events could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur solution relies on third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our solution or cause us to make generally available portions of our proprietary code.\nOur platform relies on software licensed to us by third-party authors under \u201copen source\u201d licenses. The use of open source software may entail greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public. This would allow our competitors to create similar solutions with lower development effort and time and ultimately put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nAlthough we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our solution to conditions we do not intend, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our services. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that our processes for controlling our use of open source software will be effective. If we are held to have breached the terms of an open source software license, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue operating our platform on terms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our platform or the supporting computational infrastructure to discontinue use of certain code, or to make generally available, in source code form, portions of our proprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur growth depends, in part, on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties, including ready access to hardware in key locations to facilitate the delivery of our solution and reliable management of Internet traffic.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to depend on various third-party relationships to grow our business. We continue to pursue additional relationships with third parties, such as technology and content providers, RTB exchanges, market research companies, co-location facilities and other strategic partners. Identifying, negotiating and documenting relationships with third parties requires significant time and resources as does integrating third-party data and services.\nOur agreements with providers of technology, data, computer hardware, co-location facilities and RTB exchanges are typically non-exclusive, do not prohibit them from working with our competitors or from offering competing services and do not typically have minimum purchase commitments. Our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to third parties to favor their products or services or to prevent or reduce purchases of our solution. In addition, these third parties may not perform as expected under our agreements with them, and we may have disagreements or disputes with such third parties, which could negatively affect our brand and reputation.\nIn particular, our continued growth depends on our ability to source computer hardware, including servers built to our specifications, and the ability to locate those servers and related hardware in co-location facilities in the most desirable locations to facilitate the timely delivery of our services. Similarly, disruptions in the services provided at co-location facilities that we rely upon can degrade the level of services that we can provide, which may harm our business. We also rely on our integration with many third-party technology providers to execute our business on a daily basis. We must efficiently direct a large amount of network traffic to and from our servers to consider tens of billions of bid requests per day, and each bid typically must take place in approximately 100 milliseconds. We rely on a third-party domain name service, or DNS, to direct traffic to our closest data center for efficient processing. If our DNS provider experiences disruptions or performance problems, this could result in inefficient balancing of traffic across our servers as well as impair or prevent web browser connectivity to our site, which may harm our business.\nWe may acquire other businesses, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may make investments in or acquisitions of complementary companies, products or technologies. However, we have not made any acquisitions to date, and as a result, our ability as an organization to acquire and integrate other companies, products or technologies in a successful manner is unproven. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our customers, the advertising agencies that represent them, and investors or could subject us to class action lawsuits that often follow public company acquisitions. In addition, if we are unsuccessful at integrating employees or technologies acquired, our revenue and results of operations could be adversely affected. Any integration process may require significant time and resources, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully. We may not successfully evaluate or use the acquired technology or employees, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including accounting charges. We may have to pay cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or the value of our common stock. The sale of equity or issuance of convertible debt to finance any such acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations, could weaken our financial position and the agreements governing such indebtedness could include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations or pay dividends on our common stock.\nIf our assumptions or estimates relating to our critical accounting policies change or prove to be incorrect, our operating results could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the section entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, accrued liabilities and income taxes.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations which could subject our business to higher tax liability.\nWe may be limited in the portion of net operating loss carryforwards that we can use in the future to offset taxable income for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. At December 31, 2015, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of $47.3 million, state NOLs of $41.5 million and foreign operating loss carry forwards of $4.5 million. A lack of future taxable income would adversely affect our ability to utilize these NOLs. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its NOLs to offset future taxable income. We believe that we experienced an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code in prior years that may limit our ability to utilize a portion of the NOLs. In addition, future changes in our stock ownership, including future offerings, as well as other changes that may be outside of our control, could result in additional ownership changes under Section 382 of the Code. Our NOLs may also be impaired under similar provisions of state law. We have recorded a full valuation allowance related to our NOLs and other net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the future benefits of those assets. Our NOLs may expire unutilized or underutilized, which could prevent us from offsetting future taxable income.\nWe are subject to government regulations concerning our employees, including wage-hour laws and taxes.\nWe are subject to applicable rules and regulations relating to our relationship with our employees, including health benefits, unemployment and similar taxes, overtime and working conditions, immigration status and classification of employee benefits for tax purposes. Legislated increases in additional labor cost components, such as employee benefit costs, workers\u2019 compensation insurance rates, compliance costs and fines, as well as the cost of litigation in connection with these regulations, would increase our labor costs. Moreover, we are subject to various laws and regulations in federal, state and foreign jurisdictions that impose varying rules and obligations on us with respect to the classification of employee benefits for income tax and other purposes and that require us to report and/or withhold in respect of such items. In addition, many employers nationally have been subject to actions brought by governmental agencies and private individuals under wage-hour laws on a variety of claims, such as improper classification of workers as exempt from overtime pay requirements and failure to pay overtime wages properly, with such actions sometimes brought as class actions, and these actions can result in material liabilities and expenses. Should we be subject to employment litigation, such as actions involving wage-hour, overtime, break and working time, it may distract our management from business matters and result in increased labor costs.\nWe may be subject to governmental export, import and sanctions requirements that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets.\nOur operations may be subject to U.S. export controls, including the Export Administration Regulations, or EAR, as well as economic sanctions enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. To the extent that we export proprietary software that contains or is secured by encryption technology, the EAR may require us to meet various compliance responsibilities, including complying with encryption registration, classification requests, and export licensing requirements. Furthermore, EAR and OFAC compliance requirements prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to designated countries, entities and individuals targeted by U.S. sanctions. These EAR and OFAC obligations could impact our ability to pursue business opportunities outside the United States and subject us to liability for failure to meet applicable compliance requirements.\nIn addition, various foreign countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permit and license requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to deploy our technology or could limit our customers\u2019 ability to use our solution in those countries. Changes in our technology or in applicable import and export regulations may create delays in the introduction or deployment of our technology in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from using our solution globally or, in some cases, prevent certain transactions with designated countries, entities or individuals. Such changes in applicable import, export and sanctions laws, including possible shifts in the manner in which respective governments enforce such requirements, could result in decreased use of our solution by, or in our decreased ability to export our technology to, international markets. Any decreased use of our solution or limitation on our ability to export our technology or to sell our solution would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur tax liabilities may be greater than anticipated.\nThe U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws applicable to our business activities are subject to interpretation. We are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service and by taxing authorities of the state, local and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Our tax obligations are based in part on our corporate operating structure, including the manner in which we develop, value, and use our intellectual property and sell our solution, the jurisdictions in which we operate, how tax authorities assess revenue-based taxes such as sales and use taxes, the scope of our international operations and the value we ascribe to our intercompany transactions. Taxing authorities may challenge our tax positions and methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, as well as our positions regarding jurisdictions in which we are subject to certain taxes, which could expose us to additional taxes and increase our worldwide effective tax rate. Any adverse outcomes of such challenges to our tax positions could result in additional taxes for prior periods, interest, and penalties as well as higher future taxes. In addition, our future tax expense could increase as a result of changes in tax laws, regulations or accounting principles, or as a result of earning income in jurisdictions that have higher tax rates. An increase in our tax expense could have a negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. Moreover, the determination of our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant estimates and judgment by management, and the tax treatment of certain transactions is uncertain. Although we believe we will make reasonable estimates and judgments, the ultimate outcome of any particular issue may differ from the amounts previously recorded in our financial statements and any such occurrence could materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may be volatile and the value of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and may be volatile for the foreseeable future. For example, since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in March 2015, the price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange has ranged from a low of $1.16 to a high of $11.24 through March 2, 2016. In addition, the trading prices of the securities of technology companies in general have been highly volatile. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock is likely to be subject to wide fluctuations. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock, in addition to those in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, include the following:\n\u2022\nannouncements of new offerings, products, services or technologies, commercial relationships, acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022\nsignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of technology companies in general and of companies in the digital advertising industry in particular;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the trading volume of our shares or the size of our public float;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations or key metrics;\n\u2022\nwhether our results of operations or key metrics meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors or those expectations change;\n\u2022\nlitigation involving us, our industry, or both;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the United States, foreign countries, or both;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and trends;\n\u2022\nmajor catastrophic events;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our common stock;\n\u2022\ndepartures of key employees; or\n\u2022\nan adverse impact on the company from any of the other risks cited in this report.\nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market, in general, experience a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, results of operations or financial condition. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. If our stock price is volatile, we may become the target of securities litigation, and we are presently the target of the securities litigation described under \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources from our business. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we do not meet the continued listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange our common stock may be delisted.\nOur common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The New York Stock Exchange requires us to continue to meet certain listing standards, including standards related to the trading price of our common stock, as well as our global market capitalization. While we are currently in compliance with the New York Stock Exchange continued listing requirements, we cannot assure you that we will remain in compliance. If we do not meet the New York Stock Exchange\u2019s continued listing standards, we will be notified by the New York Stock Exchange and we will be required to take corrective action to meet the continued listing standards; otherwise our common stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. A delisting of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange would reduce the liquidity and market price of our common stock and the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to access the public capital markets. A delisting would also reduce the value of our equity compensation plans, which could negatively impact our ability to retain key employees.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that sales might occur, could reduce the price of our common stock and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate.\nWe may issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investments or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nInsiders will continue to have substantial control over us, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.\nOur directors and executive officers and their affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially own approximately 57% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, based on the number of shares outstanding as of December 31, 2015. As a result, these stockholders will be able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions. They may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a manner that is adverse to your interests. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of deterring, delaying or preventing a change of control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert our management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and are required to comply with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations involves legal and financial compliance costs, makes some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increases demand on our systems and resources. Among other things, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and results of operations. Although we have already hired additional employees to comply with these requirements, we may need to hire even more employees in the future, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nBeing a public company and these rules and regulations may make it more expensive for us to maintain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to maintain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements could be impaired.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. Commencing with our fiscal year ending December 31, 2016, we are performing system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for that year, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This will require that we incur substantial additional professional fees and internal costs to expand our accounting and finance functions and that we expend significant management efforts. Prior to our initial public offering, we were never required to test our internal controls within a specified period, and, as a result, we may experience difficulty in producing accurate financial statements.\nWe may discover weaknesses in our system of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements. In addition, our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected.\nIf we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, or if we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements. If that were to happen, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, or other regulatory authorities.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nFor so long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including not being required to comply with the independent auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may take advantage of these exemptions for so long as we are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d which could be until March 5, 2020. Investors may find our common stock less attractive because we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile and may decline.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. However, we chose to \u201copt out\u201d of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish unfavorable research reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will, to some extent, depend on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us publishes unfavorable commentary about us or changes their opinion of our business prospects, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock. We intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases. In addition, our loan and security agreement contains a restriction on our ability to pay dividends.\nOur loan and security agreement contains covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities.\nBorrowings under our loan and security agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets. Our loan and security agreement also restricts our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\ndispose of or sell assets;\n\u2022\nmake material changes in our business or management;\n\u2022\nconsolidate or merge with or acquire other entities;\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincur liens on our assets;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make distributions on our capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with our affiliates; and\n\u2022\nmake any payment in respect of any subordinated indebtedness.\nThese restrictions are subject to certain exceptions. In addition, our loan and security agreement requires us to maintain and comply with certain financial covenants, including: (i) maintaining specified quarterly Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined for this purpose, with respect to any trailing twelve month period, as an amount equal to the sum of net income, plus (a) interest expense, plus (b) to the extent deducted in the calculation of net income, depreciation expense and amortization expense, plus (c) income tax expense, plus or minus (d) change in deferred revenue, less, (e) capitalized software development expenses, plus (f) any non-cash items such as stock-compensation expense (and other mutually agreed upon non-cash items), plus one-time non-recurring charges subject to the lenders approval. This covenant is to be tested on a quarterly basis beginning June 30, 2016; and (ii) maintaining at all times a 1.10 monthly minimum Adjusted Quick Ratio, which is defined as the ratio of cash held at the lender and cash equivalents plus net accounts receivables to current liabilities (including all debt outstanding under the revolving line of credit) minus the current portion of deferred revenue. This covenant is to be tested on a monthly basis.\nThe covenants in our loan and security agreement, as well as any future financing agreements that we may enter into, may restrict our ability to finance our operations, engage in, expand or otherwise pursue our business activities and strategies. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and future breaches of any of these covenants could result in a default under our loan and security agreement. If not waived, future defaults could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under our loan and security agreement to become immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit.\nIf we do not have or are unable to generate sufficient cash available to repay our debt obligations when they become due and payable, either upon maturity or in the event of a default, we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, which may negatively impact our ability to operate our business.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue shares of convertible preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by a majority vote of our entire board of directors, the chairman of our board of directors or our chief executive officer, which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least 662/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to the management of our business or our amended and restated bylaws, which may inhibit the ability of an acquiror to effect such amendments to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time.\nOur stock repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.\nIn March of 2016, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to $4.0 million. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, an assessment by management and our board of directors of cash availability and other market conditions. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and increase its volatility. The existence of our stock repurchase program could also cause the price of our common stock to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our common stock. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased such shares. Any failure to repurchase shares after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us and may negatively impact our stock price. Although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program's effectiveness.", "PERMNO": 15263, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "MXPT"}
