{"cik": "1719489", "company": "Kaleyra, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-08", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. The risk factors summarized below could materially harm our business, operating results and/or financial condition, impair our future prospects and/or cause the price of our common stock to decline. These risks are discussed more fully in the sections below. Material risks that may affect our business, operating results and financial condition include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nKaleyra currently generates significant revenue from its largest customers, and the loss or decline in revenue from any of these customers could limit Kaleyra\u2019s revenue and results of operations.\n\u2022\nKaleyra must increase the network traffic and resulting revenue from the services that it offers to realize its targets for anticipated revenue growth, cash flow and operating performance.\n\u2022\nCustomers that use many of the features of Kaleyra\u2019s services or use Kaleyra\u2019s services to support or enable core functionality for their applications may have difficulty or find it impractical to replace Kaleyra\u2019s services with a competitor\u2019s services, while customers that use only limited functionality may be able to more easily replace Kaleyra\u2019s services with competitive offerings.\n\u2022\nKaleyra is unable to predict the extent to which the global COVID-19 pandemic or the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine may adversely impact Kaleyra\u2019s business operations, financial performance, results of operations and stock price.\n\u2022\nThe market in which Kaleyra participates is highly competitive, and if Kaleyra does not compete effectively, its business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\n\u2022\nThe length and unpredictability of the sales cycle for Kaleyra\u2019s technology offerings and services could delay new sales and cause Kaleyra\u2019s revenue and cash flows for any given quarter to fail to meet Kaleyra\u2019s projections or market expectations.\n\u2022\nThe market for Kaleyra\u2019s products and Platforms is still developing, may decline or experience limited growth and is dependent in part on developers continuing to adopt its Platforms and use its products.\n\u2022\nKaleyra\u2019s future success depends in part on its ability to drive the adoption of its products by international customers.\n\u2022\nKaleyra is in the process of expanding its international operations, which exposes Kaleyra to significant risks.\n\u2022\nKaleyra\u2019s operations are subject to regulation and require Kaleyra to obtain and maintain several governmental licenses and permits. If Kaleyra violates those regulatory requirements or fail to obtain and maintain those licenses and permits, including payment of related fees, if any, Kaleyra may not be able to conduct its business. Moreover, those regulatory requirements could change in a manner that significantly increases Kaleyra\u2019s costs or otherwise adversely affects Kaleyra\u2019s operations.\n\u2022\nCertain of Kaleyra\u2019s products are subject to telecommunications-related regulations, and future legislative or regulatory actions could harm Kaleyra\u2019s business.\n\u2022\nThe future sales of shares by existing stockholders and future exercise of registration rights may adversely affect the market price of Kaleyra\u2019s common stock.\n\u2022\nKaleyra has limited experience with respect to determining the optimal prices for its product.\n\u2022\nBreaches of Kaleyra\u2019s networks or systems, or those of Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d) or Kaleyra\u2019s other service providers, could compromise the integrity of its products, Platforms and data, result in significant data losses and otherwise harm its business.\n\u2022\nIf Kaleyra loses any of its key personnel or is unable to attract and retain the talent required for its business, Kaleyra\u2019s business could be disrupted, and its financial performance could suffer.\n\u2022\nKaleyra has experienced rapid internal growth as well as growth through acquisitions in recent periods. If Kaleyra fails to manage its growth effectively, or its business does not grow as expected, Kaleyra\u2019s operating results may suffer.\n\u2022\nIf the benefits of the acquisitions of mGage and Bandyer do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the potential for the market price of Kaleyra\u2019s securities may decline.\n\u2022\nIf Kaleyra causes disruptions in its customers\u2019 businesses or provides inadequate service, Kaleyra\u2019s customers may have claims for substantial damages against Kaleyra, which could cause Kaleyra to lose customers, have a negative effect on Kaleyra\u2019s reputation, and adversely affect its results of operations.\n\u2022\nIf Kaleyra is unable to protect its intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties, its business could be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nKaleyra\u2019s ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\n\u2022\nAny failure to deliver and maintain high-quality customer support may adversely affect Kaleyra\u2019s relationships with its customers and prospective customers and could adversely affect Kaleyra\u2019s reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nDefects or errors in Kaleyra\u2019s services could diminish demand for Kaleyra\u2019s services, harm Kaleyra\u2019s business and subject Kaleyra to liability.\n\u2022\nAnti-takeover provisions in Kaleyra\u2019s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of Kaleyra or changes in its management and, therefore, depress the trading price of its securities.\n\u2022\nKaleyra has never paid dividends on its capital stock and does not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, any profits from an investment in Kaleyra\u2019s common stock will depend on whether the price of Kaleyra\u2019s common stock increases.\n\u2022\nIf Kaleyra is unable to protect its information systems against service interruption or failure, misappropriation of data or breaches of security, its operations could be disrupted, it could be subject to costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and its reputation may be damaged.\nYou should consider carefully all of the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report, before making a decision to invest in our securities. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Kaleyra\u2019s Financial Condition and Operations\nThe market in which Kaleyra participates is highly competitive, and if Kaleyra does not compete effectively, its business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nThe CPaaS market is highly competitive and characterized by continuous technological change. The principal competitive factors in this market include completeness of offering, credibility with developers and business users, global reach, ease of integration, product features, platform scalability, brand reputation and awareness, customer support, and the cost of deployment of product offerings. Kaleyra believes that it competes favorably within each of these categories.\nKaleyra competes with several vendors across its various product lines, including:\n\u2022\nLegacy on-premises vendors, such as Avaya Holdings Corp., Cisco Systems, Inc. (through its acquisition of IMIMobile), and SAP SE;\n\u2022\nDirect competitors, such as CLX Communications AB (d/b/a Sinch), Twilio Inc., and Vonage Holdings Corp.;\n\u2022\nSmaller software companies that compete with certain portions of Kaleyra\u2019s communications services offerings; and\n\u2022\nSaaS companies that offer prepackaged applications for a narrow set of use cases.\nSome competitors have greater financial, technical and other resources, greater name and brand recognition, larger sales and marketing efforts and larger portfolios of intellectual property. As a result, certain competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing technologies, opportunities, standards or customer needs and requests. With the introduction of new products and services and new market entrants, Kaleyra expects competition to intensify in the future. Furthermore, as Kaleyra continues to expand the scope of its Platforms, it may face additional competition. Kaleyra is also addressing enterprises that have developed over the years \u201cin-house\u201d products for which Kaleyra can offer a more cost-effective, robust and richer set of products to enhance the total cost of ownership and return on investment for such customers. Kaleyra\u2019s current and potential competitors may develop and market new services with comparable functionality to Kaleyra\u2019s services, and this could lead to Kaleyra having to decrease prices to remain competitive. If Kaleyra is unable to maintain Kaleyra\u2019s current pricing due to the competitive pressures, its margins will be reduced and Kaleyra\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nCustomers that use many of the features of Kaleyra\u2019s services or use Kaleyra\u2019s services to support or enable core functionality for their applications may have difficulty or find it impractical to replace Kaleyra\u2019s services with a competitor\u2019s services, while customers that use only limited functionality may be able to more easily replace Kaleyra\u2019s services with competitive offerings.\nWith the introduction of new services and new market entrants, Kaleyra expects competition to intensify in the future. In addition, some of Kaleyra\u2019s customers choose to use Kaleyra\u2019s services and Kaleyra\u2019s competitors\u2019 services at the same time. Moreover, as Kaleyra expands the scope of Kaleyra\u2019s services, Kaleyra may face additional competition. Further, customers and consumers may choose to adopt other forms of electronic communications or alternative communication platforms, including developing necessary networks and platforms in-house.\nFurthermore, if Kaleyra\u2019s competitors were to merge such that the combined entity would be able to compete fully with Kaleyra\u2019s service offering, then Kaleyra\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. If one or more of Kaleyra\u2019s competitors were to merge or partner with another of Kaleyra\u2019s competitors, the change in the competitive landscape could also adversely affect Kaleyra\u2019s ability to compete effectively. In addition, pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced revenue, reduced margins, increased losses or the failure of Kaleyra\u2019s services to achieve or maintain widespread market acceptance.\nKaleyra\u2019s current and potential competitors have developed and may develop in the future product solutions that are available internationally. To the extent that customers seek product solutions that include support and scaling internationally, they may choose to use other service providers to fill their communication service needs. Each of these factors could harm Kaleyra\u2019s business by leading to reduced revenues, slower growth and lower brand name recognition than Kaleyra\u2019s competitors.\nKaleyra currently generates significant revenue from its largest customers, and the loss or decline in revenue from any of these customers could limit Kaleyra\u2019s revenue and results of operations.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Kaleyra\u2019s 10 largest customers generated an aggregate of 42% and 52% of its revenue, respectively. In the event that Kaleyra\u2019s large customers do not continue to use its products, use fewer of its products, or use its products in a more limited capacity, or not at all, Kaleyra\u2019s revenue could be limited and Kaleyra\u2019s business could be harmed.\nKaleyra must increase the network traffic and resulting revenue from the services that it offers to realize its targets for anticipated revenue growth, cash flow and operating performance.\nApproximately 37% of Kaleyra\u2019s growth in fiscal year 2021 came from its existing customer base, predominantly through increased traffic volume. Kaleyra must increase the network traffic and resulting revenue from its inbound and outbound voice calling, text messaging, telephone numbers and related services at acceptable margins to realize Kaleyra\u2019s targets for anticipated revenue growth, cash flow and operating performance. If Kaleyra does not maintain or improve its current relationships with existing key customers; is not able to expand the available capacity on its network to meet its customers\u2019 demands in a timely manner; does not develop new large enterprise customers; or its customers determine to obtain these services from either their own network or from one of Kaleyra\u2019s competitors, then Kaleyra may be unable to increase or maintain its revenue at acceptable margins.\nKaleyra has limited experience with respect to determining the optimal prices for its product.\nKaleyra charges its customers based on their use of its products. Kaleyra expects that it may need to change its pricing from time to time. In the past Kaleyra has sometimes reduced their prices either for individual customers in connection with long-term agreements or for a particular product. One of the challenges to Kaleyra\u2019s pricing is that the fees that they pay to network service providers over whose networks Kaleyra transmits communications can vary daily or weekly and are affected by volume and other factors that may be outside of Kaleyra\u2019s control and difficult to predict. This can result in Kaleyra incurring increased costs that Kaleyra may be unable or unwilling to pass through to its customers, which could harm Kaleyra\u2019s business.\nKaleyra is seeking to expand its business in the U.S. as Kaleyra believes that doing so will result in termination fees (which are the pass-through charge to access the network or carrier) that are significantly lower than the termination fees Kaleyra is subject to in the other countries where it operates, which Kaleyra expects would result in higher gross margins, especially with its enterprise customers. However, there are no assurances that Kaleyra will be successful in this expansion or achieving the related termination fee gross margin improvement.\nFurther, as competitors introduce new products or services that compete with Kaleyra\u2019s or reduce their prices, Kaleyra may be unable to attract new customers or retain existing customers based on Kaleyra\u2019s historical pricing. As Kaleyra expands internationally, Kaleyra also must determine the appropriate price to enable Kaleyra to compete effectively internationally. Moreover, enterprises, which are a primary focus for Kaleyra\u2019s direct sales efforts, may demand substantial price concessions. In addition, if the mix of products sold changes, including for a shift to Internet protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) based products, then Kaleyra may need to, or choose to, revise its pricing. As a result, in the future Kaleyra may be required or choose to reduce its prices or change its pricing model, which could harm Kaleyra\u2019s business.\nTo deliver Kaleyra\u2019s products, Kaleyra relies on network service providers and Internet service providers for its network service and connectivity.\nKaleyra currently interconnects with network service providers around the world to enable the use by Kaleyra\u2019s customers of its products over their networks. Kaleyra expects that it will continue to rely heavily on network service providers for these services going forward. Kaleyra\u2019s reliance on network service providers has reduced Kaleyra\u2019s operating flexibility, ability to make timely service changes and control quality of service. In addition, the fees that Kaleyra is charged by network service providers may change daily or weekly, while Kaleyra does not typically change its customers\u2019 pricing as rapidly.\nAt times, some network service providers have instituted additional fees due to regulatory, competitive or other industry related changes that increase Kaleyra network costs. For example, in 2018 Kaleyra was subject to a pricing increase of more than 10% from certain mobile network service providers for delivered messages. While Kaleyra has historically responded to these types of fee increases through a combination of further negotiating efforts with Kaleyra\u2019s network service providers, absorbing the increased costs or changing Kaleyra\u2019s prices to customers, here Kaleyra identified a unique strategy that allowed it to change its customers prices without affecting Kaleyra\u2019s business. There is no guarantee that Kaleyra will continue to be able to use the same strategy in the future without a material negative impact to Kaleyra business. Additionally, Kaleyra\u2019s ability to respond to any new fees may be constrained if all network service providers in a particular market impose equivalent fee structures, if the magnitude of the fees is disproportionately large when compared to the underlying prices paid by Kaleyra customers, or if the market conditions limit Kaleyra ability to increase the price Kaleyra charges its customers.\nFurthermore, some of these network service providers do not have long-term committed contracts with Kaleyra and may terminate their agreements with Kaleyra without notice or restriction. If a significant portion of Kaleyra\u2019s network service providers stop providing Kaleyra with access to their infrastructure, fail to provide these services to Kaleyra on a cost-effective basis, cease operations, or otherwise terminate these services, the delay caused by qualifying and switching to other network service providers could be time consuming and costly and could adversely affect Kaleyra\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, if problems occur with Kaleyra\u2019s network service providers, it may cause errors or poor-quality communications with Kaleyra\u2019s products, and it could encounter difficulty identifying the source of the problem. The occurrence of errors or poor-quality communications on Kaleyra\u2019s products, whether caused by Kaleyra\u2019s Platforms or a network service provider, may result in the loss of Kaleyra\u2019s existing customers or the delay of adoption of Kaleyra\u2019s products by potential customers and may adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nKaleyra also interconnects with Internet service providers around the world to enable the use of Kaleyra\u2019s communication products by its customers, and Kaleyra expects that it will continue to rely heavily on Internet service providers for network connectivity going forward. Kaleyra\u2019s reliance on Internet service providers reduces Kaleyra\u2019s control over quality of service and exposes Kaleyra to potential service outages and rate fluctuations. If a significant portion of Kaleyra\u2019s Internet service providers stop providing Kaleyra with access to their network infrastructure, fail to provide access on a cost-effective basis, cease operations, or otherwise terminate access, the delay caused by qualifying and switching to other Internet service providers could be time consuming and costly and could harm Kaleyra\u2019s business and operations.\nIf Kaleyra is unable to expand its relationships with existing technology partner customers and add new technology partner customers, Kaleyra\u2019s business could be harmed.\nKaleyra believes that the continued growth of its business depends in part upon developing and expanding strategic relationships with technology partner customers. Technology partner customers embed Kaleyra software products in their solutions, such as software applications for contact centers and salesforce and marketing automation, and then sell such solutions to other businesses. When potential customers do not have the available developer resources to build their own applications, Kaleyra refers them to either its technology partners who embed Kaleyra\u2019s products in the solutions that they sell to other businesses or Kaleyra\u2019s consulting partners who provide consulting and development services for organizations that have limited software development expertise to build Kaleyra\u2019s Platforms into their software applications.\nAs part of Kaleyra\u2019s growth strategy, it intends to expand Kaleyra\u2019s relationships with existing technology partner customers and add new technology partner customers. If Kaleyra fails to expand its relationships with existing technology partner customers or establish relationships with new technology partner customers in a timely and cost-effective manner, or at all, then Kaleyra\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Additionally, even if Kaleyra is successful at building these relationships but there are problems or issues with integrating Kaleyra\u2019s products into the solutions of these customers, Kaleyra\u2019s reputation and ability to grow its business may be harmed.\nThe length and unpredictability of the sales cycle for Kaleyra\u2019s technology offerings and services could delay new sales and cause Kaleyra\u2019s revenue and cash flows for any given quarter to fail to meet Kaleyra\u2019s projections or market expectations.\nThe timing of the sales cycle from Kaleyra\u2019s initial contact with a potential client through the signing of a contract to provide technology offerings and services varies. As a result of the variability and length of the sales cycle, Kaleyra has a limited ability to forecast the timing of new sales. A delay in or failure to complete transactions could harm Kaleyra\u2019s business and financial results, and could cause Kaleyra\u2019s financial results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Kaleyra\u2019s sales cycle varies widely, reflecting differences in Kaleyra\u2019s potential customers\u2019 decision-making processes, procurement requirements, and budget cycles, and is subject to significant risks over which Kaleyra has little or no control, including:\n\u2022\nKaleyra\u2019s customers\u2019 budgetary constraints and priorities;\n\u2022\nthe timing of Kaleyra\u2019s customers\u2019 budget cycles; and\n\u2022\nthe length and timing of customers\u2019 approval processes.\nThe market for Kaleyra\u2019s products and Platforms is still developing, may decline or experience limited growth and is dependent in part on customers continuing to adopt its Platforms and use its products.\nKaleyra and its subsidiaries have been developing its Platforms to enable business users and developers within organizations to programme voice, messaging and other communications. The market for omnichannel communication with seamless service between communication methods is relatively new and unproven and is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Kaleyra believes that its revenue currently constitutes a portion of the total revenue in this market, and therefore, Kaleyra believes that its future success will depend in large part on the growth, if any, of this market. The utilization of APIs by developers and organizations to build communications functionality into their applications is still relatively new, and developers and organizations may not recognize the need for, or benefits of, Kaleyra products and Platforms. Moreover, if they do not recognize the need for and benefits of Kaleyra products and Platforms, they may decide to adopt alternative products and services to satisfy some portion of their business needs.\nIn order to grow Kaleyra\u2019s business and extend Kaleyra's market position, Kaleyra intends to focus on educating developers and business users within organizations about the benefits of Kaleyra products and Platforms, expanding the functionality of Kaleyra products and bringing new technologies to market to increase market acceptance and use of Kaleyra\u2019s Platforms. Kaleyra\u2019s ability to expand the market that Kaleyra products and Platforms address depends upon a number of factors, including the cost, performance and perceived value associated with such products and Platforms. The market for Kaleyra\u2019s products and Platforms could fail to grow significantly\nor there could be a reduction in demand for Kaleyra products as a result of a lack of developer acceptance, technological challenges, competing products and services, decreases in spending by current and prospective customers, weakening economic conditions and other causes. If Kaleyra\u2019s market does not experience significant growth or demand for Kaleyra products decreases, then Kaleyra\u2019s business and operations could be harmed.\nKaleyra\u2019s Platforms must integrate with a variety of network, hardware, mobile and software platforms and technologies, and its need to continuously modify and enhance Kaleyra\u2019s products and Platforms to adapt to changes and innovation in these technologies. For example, Apple, Google and other cell-phone operating system providers or inbox service providers may develop new applications or functions intended to filter spam and unwanted phone calls, messages or other communications. Similarly, Kaleyra\u2019s network service providers may adopt new filtering technologies in an effort to combat spam or robocalling. Such technologies may inadvertently filter desired messages or calls to or from Kaleyra\u2019s customers. If cell-phone operating system providers, network service providers, Kaleyra\u2019s customers or their end-users adopt new software platforms or infrastructure, Kaleyra may be required to develop new versions of its products to work with those new platforms or infrastructure. This development effort may require significant resources, which would adversely affect Kaleyra\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. Any failure of Kaleyra\u2019s products and Platforms to operate effectively with evolving or new platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for Kaleyra\u2019s products. If Kaleyra is unable to respond to market changes in a cost-effective manner, Kaleyra\u2019s products may become less marketable and less competitive or obsolete.\nKaleyra\u2019s future success depends in part on its ability to drive the adoption of its products by international customers.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Kaleyra derived 55.5% and 66.9% of its revenue, respectively, from customer accounts located in Italy and India. Revenue deriving from customer accounts located in the U.S. increased from 17.3% in 2020 to 21.4% in 2021, while revenue deriving from customer accounts located in the European countries other than Italy increased from 6.7% in the year ended December 31, 2020 to 7.2% in the year ended December 31, 2021. Revenues deriving from customer accounts located in South America increased from 0% in 2020 to 7.7% in 2021. Revenue derived from customer accounts located in the rest of the world decreased from 9.1% in 2020 to 8.2% in 2021. This is in line with the expansion strategy out of Italy and India identified by Kaleyra. The future success of Kaleyra\u2019s business will depend, in part, on Kaleyra ability to expand its customer base worldwide in new geographies. If Kaleyra is unable to increase the revenue that it derives from international customers, Kaleyra\u2019s business and results of operations could be harmed.\nKaleyra\u2019s global operations are subject to complex risks, some of which might be beyond its control.\nKaleyra is headquartered in Milan, Italy, has a sizable presence in India and the United States, and operates in other countries throughout the world. In addition, Kaleyra\u2019s customers have operations throughout the world, and Kaleyra derives a substantial part of its revenue internationally. As a result, Kaleyra may be subject to risks inherently associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and/or contractual rights, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including economic sanctions and export control regulations, potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas, and other barriers, potential difficulties in collecting trade receivables, international hostilities, such as the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, terrorism, and natural disasters. Expansion of international operations also increases the likelihood of potential or actual violations of domestic and international anticorruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or of U.S. and international export control and sanctions regulations. Kaleyra may also face difficulties integrating any new facilities in different countries into its existing operations, as well as integrating employees that it hires in different countries into its existing corporate culture. If Kaleyra is unable to manage the risks of its global operations, its business could be harmed.\nKaleyra is in the process of expanding its international operations, which exposes Kaleyra to significant risks.\nKaleyra is continuing to expand its international operations to increase its revenue from customers outside of Italy, India and the U.S. as part of Kaleyra\u2019s growth strategy. Between 2017 and 2021, Kaleyra\u2019s international headcount grew from 60 employees to 564 employees. Kaleyra expects to open additional international offices and\nhire employees to work at these offices in order to reach new customers and gain access to additional technical talent. Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject Kaleyra to regulatory, economic and political risks in addition to those Kaleyra already faces in Italy, India and the U.S. Because of Kaleyra\u2019s limited experience with international operations or with developing and managing sales in additional international markets beyond Italy and India, Kaleyra\u2019s international expansion efforts may not be successful.\nIn addition, Kaleyra will face risks in doing business internationally that could adversely affect its business, including:\n\u2022\nexposure to political developments and economic and social conditions in the U.S. and other countries in which we are located or do business, and elsewhere as a result of geopolitical developments, such as the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has created an uncertain political and economic environment, disruption and instability for businesses and volatility in global financial markets or which could damage or disrupt international commerce and the global economy and which therefore could have an adverse impact on our business;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of managing and staffing international operations and the increased operations, travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with servicing international customers and operating numerous international locations;\n\u2022\nKaleyra\u2019s ability to effectively price its products in competitive international markets;\n\u2022\nnew and different sources of competition;\n\u2022\nKaleyra\u2019s ability to comply with the European Union\u2019s GDPR and the privacy regulations of other jurisdictions;\n\u2022\npotentially greater difficulty collecting trade receivables and longer payment cycles;\n\u2022\nhigher or more variable network service provider fees outside of the U.S.;\n\u2022\nthe need to adapt and localize Kaleyra\u2019s products for specific countries;\n\u2022\nthe need to offer customer support in various languages;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in various jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nunderstanding and reconciling different technical standards, data privacy and telecommunications regulations, registration and certification requirements in various jurisdictions, which could prevent customers from deploying Kaleyra\u2019s products or limit their usage;\n\u2022\nexport controls and economic sanctions administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security and the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control or other countries, including the United Kingdom and member countries of the European Union, including those levied against Russia and Russian interests as a result of the actions of Russia in Ukraine, and additional future sanctions and controls;\n\u2022\ncompliance with various anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010;\n\u2022\ntariffs and other non-tariff barriers, such as quotas and local content rules;\n\u2022\nmore limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could increase the price of Kaleyra\u2019s products outside of the U.S., increase the expenses of Kaleyra\u2019s international operations and expose Kaleyra to foreign currency exchange rate risk;\n\u2022\ncurrency control regulations, which might restrict or prohibit Kaleyra\u2019s conversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\u2022\ndeterioration of political relations between various countries; and\n\u2022\npolitical or social unrest or economic instability in a specific country or region in which Kaleyra operates, which could have an adverse impact on Kaleyra\u2019s operations in that location.\nAlso, due to costs from Kaleyra\u2019s international expansion efforts and network service provider fees outside of the U.S., which generally are higher than domestic rates, Kaleyra\u2019s gross margin for international customers is typically lower than its gross margin for domestic customers. As a result, Kaleyra\u2019s gross margin may be impacted and fluctuate as Kaleyra expands its operations and customer base worldwide.\nKaleyra\u2019s failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm Kaleyra\u2019s business and international operations.\nWe contract and otherwise use third parties from throughout the world in furtherance of the provision of our services.\nWe currently depend on various third-party vendors throughout the world for the provision of our services to our customers. This subjects us to a number of risks ranging from the quality of the services provided to us by such vendors, to the ability of these vendors to be able to provide services to us to the extent that such vendors are themselves impacted by events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, or economic or geopolitical fallout from such events. A Singapore vendor which we use to provide a messaging gateway that we use for some international connections has a majority of its employees in Russia. The imposition of economic sanctions on Russia and Russian entities by many countries, although not targeted towards this entity, could have an impact on the services provided to us by this entity to the extent that such sanctions have an adverse economic effect on the general Russian economy. In addition, sanctions imposed by the U.S., the United Kingdom, the European Union, and other countries against Russia as a result of the military conflict in Ukraine, any related counter-sanctions, and any further escalation of the political tensions or economic instability in the area could have an adverse impact on other third party vendors. If the operations of any third parties providing services to us are disrupted or discontinued due to local instability, political, economic, or military conditions, our ability to provide services to some of our current customers and the development of new products or enhancement of existing products could be delayed, and our results of operations could be adversely affected. We anticipate that we will continue to depend on these and other third-party relationships in order to grow our business for the foreseeable future. If we are unsuccessful in maintaining existing and, if needed, establishing new relationships with third parties, our ability to efficiently operate existing services or develop new services and provide adequate customer support could be impaired, and, as a result, our competitive position or our results of operations could suffer\nKaleyra\u2019s operations are subject to regulation and require Kaleyra to obtain and maintain several governmental licenses and permits. If Kaleyra violates those regulatory requirements or fail to obtain and maintain those licenses and permits, including payment of related fees, if any, Kaleyra may not be able to conduct its business. Moreover, those regulatory requirements could change in a manner that significantly increases Kaleyra\u2019s costs or otherwise adversely affects Kaleyra\u2019s operations.\nIn the ordinary course of operating Kaleyra\u2019s network and providing its services, Kaleyra must obtain and maintain a variety of telecommunications and other licenses and authorizations. Kaleyra also must comply with a variety of regulatory obligations. There can be no assurance Kaleyra can maintain its licenses or that they will be renewed upon their expiration. Kaleyra\u2019s failure to obtain or maintain necessary licenses, authorizations or to comply with the obligations imposed upon license holders, including the payment of fees, may cause sanctions or additional costs, including the revocation of authority to provide services.\nKaleyra\u2019s operations are subject to regulation at the national level and, often, at the state and local levels. Kaleyra\u2019s operations will become subject to additional regulation by other countries as Kaleyra expands to international markets. Changes to existing regulations or rules, or the failure to regulate going forward in areas historically regulated on matters such as network neutrality, licensing fees, environmental, health and safety, privacy, intercarrier compensation, emergency 911 services interconnection and other areas, in general or particular to Kaleyra\u2019s industry, may increase costs, restrict operations or decrease revenue. As Kaleyra expands internationally, Kaleyra will also become subject to telecommunications laws and regulations in the foreign countries where Kaleyra offers its products. Kaleyra\u2019s international operations are subject to country-specific governmental regulation that may increase its costs or impact its products and Platforms or prevent Kaleyra from offering or providing Kaleyra\u2019s products in certain countries. Kaleyra\u2019s inability or failure to comply with telecommunications and other laws and regulations could cause the temporary or permanent suspension of Kaleyra\u2019s operations, and if Kaleyra cannot provide emergency calling functionality through its Platforms to meet any new federal or state requirements, or any applicable requirements from other countries, the competitive advantages that Kaleyra currently has may not persist, adversely affecting Kaleyra ability to obtain and to retain enterprise customers which could have an adverse impact on Kaleyra\u2019s business.\nU.S. federal legislation and international laws impose certain obligations on the senders of commercial communications, which could minimize the effectiveness of Kaleyra\u2019s Platforms, and establish financial penalties for non-compliance, which could increase the costs of Kaleyra\u2019s business.\nThe CAN-SPAM Act establishes certain requirements for commercial messages and transactional messages and specifies penalties for the transmission of messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content. Among other things, the CAN-SPAM Act, obligates the sender of commercial messages to provide recipients with the ability to \u201copt-out\u201d of receiving future commercial communications from the sender. In addition, some U.S. states have passed laws regulating commercial communication practices that are significantly more restrictive and difficult to comply with than the CAN-SPAM Act. For example, Utah and Michigan prohibit the sending of communication messages that advertise products or services that minors are prohibited by law from purchasing (e.g., alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, illegal drugs) or that contain content harmful to minors (e.g., pornography) to message addresses listed on specified child protection registries. Some portions of these state laws may not be preempted by the CAN-SPAM Act. In addition, certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, such as Australia, Canada, and the EU, have enacted laws that regulate sending messages, and some of these laws are more restrictive than U.S. laws. For example, some foreign laws prohibit sending broad categories of messages unless the recipient has provided the sender advance consent to receipt of such messages, or in other words has \u201copted-in\u201d to receiving such communications. If Kaleyra were found to be in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act, applicable state laws governing messages not preempted by the CAN-SPAM Act or foreign laws regulating the distribution of messages, whether as a result of violations by Kaleyra\u2019s customers or its own acts or omissions, Kaleyra could be required to pay large penalties, which would adversely affect its financial condition, significantly harm Kaleyra\u2019s business, injure Kaleyra\u2019s reputation and erode customer trust. The terms of any injunctions, judgments, consent decrees or settlement agreements entered into in connection with enforcement actions or investigations against Kaleyra in connection with any of the foregoing laws may also require Kaleyra to change one or more aspects of the way Kaleyra operates its business, which could impair Kaleyra\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers or could increase its operating costs.\nChanges in laws and regulations related to the Internet or changes in the Internet infrastructure itself may diminish the demand for Kaleyra\u2019s products.\nThe future success of Kaleyra\u2019s business depends upon the continued use of the Internet as a primary medium for commerce, communications and business applications. U.S. federal, state or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws or regulations affecting the use of the Internet as a commercial medium. Changes in these laws or regulations could require Kaleyra to modify its products and Platforms in order to comply with these changes. In addition, government agencies or private organizations have imposed and may impose additional taxes, fees or other charges for accessing the Internet or commerce conducted via the Internet. These laws or charges could limit the growth of Internet-related commerce or communications generally or result in reductions in the demand for Internet-based products and services such as Kaleyra\u2019s products and Platforms. In addition, the use of the Internet as a business tool could be adversely affected due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of Internet activity, security, reliability, cost, ease-of-use, accessibility and quality of service. The performance of the Internet and its acceptance as a business tool has been adversely affected by \u201cviruses\u201d, \u201cworms\u201d, and similar malicious programs. If the use of the Internet is reduced as a result of these or other issues, then demand for Kaleyra\u2019s products could decline, which could impair Kaleyra\u2019s business and reduce its financial results.\nCertain of Kaleyra\u2019s products are subject to telecommunications-related regulations, and future legislative or regulatory actions could harm Kaleyra\u2019s business.\nAs Kaleyra continues to expand internationally, Kaleyra has become subject to telecommunications laws and regulations in the foreign countries where Kaleyra offers its products. For example, in Italy, Kaleyra holds a license to be a fixed-line operator and is subject to (1) the Electronic Communications Code, or the ECC, which has been enacted with Legislative Decree no. 259/2003, as amended, which transposed a package of European Directives adopted in 2002 and amended in 2009; (2) the National Numbering Plan, issued with AGCom\u2019s resolution no. 8/15/CIR as amended, which governs the usage of national numbers for the provision of electronic communications services as a whole; (3) resolutions on the use of alphanumeric indications for the identification of the calling subject in SMS (so-called Alias), that are periodically issued by AGCom, starting from AGCom\u2019s resolution no. 42/13/CIR; and (4) GDPR.\nKaleyra\u2019s international operations are subject to country-specific governmental regulation and related actions that have increased and may continue to increase Kaleyra\u2019s costs or impact its products and Platforms or prevent Kaleyra from offering or providing Kaleyra\u2019s products in certain countries. Certain of Kaleyra\u2019s products may be used by customers located in countries where voice and other forms of IP communications may be illegal or require special licensing or in countries on a U.S. embargo list. Even where Kaleyra\u2019s products are reportedly illegal or become illegal or where users are located in an embargoed country, users in those countries may be able to continue to use Kaleyra\u2019s products in those countries notwithstanding the illegality or embargo. Kaleyra may be subject to penalties or governmental action if consumers continue to use its products in countries where it is illegal to do so, and any such penalties or governmental action may be costly and may harm Kaleyra\u2019s business and damage its brand and reputation. Kaleyra may be required to incur additional expenses to meet applicable international regulatory requirements or be required to discontinue those services if required by law or if Kaleyra cannot or will not meet those requirements. Any of the foregoing could harm Kaleyra\u2019s business.\nIf Kaleyra is unable to effectively process local number and toll-free number portability provisioning in a timely manner or to obtain or retain direct inward dialing numbers and local or toll-free numbers, Kaleyra\u2019s business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nKaleyra\u2019s future success depends in part on its ability to procure large quantities of local and toll-free direct inward dialing numbers (\u201cDIDs\u201d), in the U.S. and in foreign countries at a reasonable cost and without restrictions. Kaleyra\u2019s ability to procure, distribute and retain DIDs depends on factors outside of Kaleyra\u2019s control, such as applicable local jurisdiction specific regulations, the practices of network service providers that provide DIDs, such as offering DIDs with conditional minimum volume call level requirements, the cost of these DIDs and the level of overall competitive demand for new DIDs.\nIn addition, in order to procure, distribute and retain telephone numbers from the EU or certain other regions, Kaleyra may be required to register with the local telecommunications regulatory authorities, some of which have been increasingly monitoring and regulating the categories of phone numbers that are eligible for provisioning to Kaleyra\u2019s customers. Kaleyra has registered and is in the process of registering in various countries in which Kaleyra does business, but in some countries, the regulatory regime around provisioning of phone numbers is unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Furthermore, these regulations and governments\u2019 approaches to their enforcement, as well as Kaleyra\u2019s products and services, are still evolving and Kaleyra may be unable to maintain compliance with applicable regulations, or enforce compliance by Kaleyra\u2019s customers, on a timely basis or without significant cost. Also, compliance with these types of regulation may require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue. If Kaleyra or its customers use phone numbers in these countries in a manner that violates applicable rules and regulations, Kaleyra may also be subject to significant penalties or governmental action, including government-initiated audits and, in extreme cases, may be precluded from doing business in that particular country. In the event of such non-compliance, Kaleyra may be forced to reclaim phone numbers from Kaleyra\u2019s customers, which could result in loss of customers, breach of contract claims, loss of revenue, reputational harm, and erosion of customer trust, all of which could harm Kaleyra\u2019s business and reputation.\nDue to their limited availability, there are certain popular area code prefixes that Kaleyra generally cannot obtain. Kaleyra\u2019s inability to acquire or retain DIDs for its operations would make Kaleyra\u2019s voice and messaging products less attractive to potential customers in the affected local geographic areas. In addition, future growth in Kaleyra\u2019s customer base, together with growth in the customer bases of other providers of cloud communications, has increased, which increases Kaleyra\u2019s dependence on sufficiently large quantities of DIDs. It may become increasingly difficult to source larger quantities of DIDs as Kaleyra\u2019s scale and its need to pay higher costs for DIDs, and DIDs may become subject to more stringent regulation or conditions of usage such as the registration and on-going compliance requirements discussed above could harm Kaleyra\u2019s business.\nKaleyra customers\u2019 and other users\u2019 violation of Kaleyra\u2019s policies or other misuse of Kaleyra\u2019s Platforms to transmit unauthorized, offensive or illegal messages, spam, phishing scams, and website links to harmful applications or for other fraudulent or illegal activity could damage Kaleyra\u2019s reputation, and Kaleyra may face a risk of litigation and liability for unauthorized, inaccurate, or fraudulent information distributed via Kaleyra\u2019s Platforms.\nThe actual or perceived improper sending of text messages may subject Kaleyra to potential risks, including liabilities or claims relating to consumer protection laws. For example, the TCPA restricts telemarketing and the use of automatic text messages without proper consent. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the delivery of text messages are continuously evolving and developing. If Kaleyra does not comply with these laws or regulations or if Kaleyra becomes liable under these laws or regulations due to the failure of Kaleyra\u2019s customers to comply with these laws by obtaining proper consent, Kaleyra could face direct liability.\nMoreover, despite Kaleyra\u2019s ongoing and substantial efforts to limit such use, certain customers may use Kaleyra\u2019s Platforms to transmit unauthorized, offensive or illegal messages, spam, phishing scams, and website links to harmful applications, reproduce and distribute copyrighted material or the trademarks of others without permission, and report inaccurate or fraudulent data or information. These issues also arise with respect to a portion of those users who use Kaleyra\u2019s Platforms on a free trial basis. These actions are in violation of Kaleyra\u2019s policies. However, Kaleyra\u2019s efforts to defeat spamming attacks and other fraudulent activity will not prevent all such attacks and activity, such use of Kaleyra\u2019s Platforms could damage Kaleyra\u2019s reputation and it could face claims for damages, copyright or trademark infringement, defamation, negligence, or fraud. Moreover, Kaleyra customers\u2019 and other users\u2019 promotion of their products and services through Kaleyra\u2019s Platforms might not comply with U.S. federal, state, and foreign laws. Kaleyra relies on contractual representations made to Kaleyra by its customers that their use of Kaleyra\u2019s Platforms will comply with Kaleyra\u2019s policies and applicable law, including, without limitation, Kaleyra\u2019s message communication policy. Although Kaleyra will retain the right to verify that customers and other users are abiding by certain contractual terms, Kaleyra\u2019s Authorized Use Policy and Kaleyra\u2019s message communication policy and, in certain circumstances, to review their distribution lists, Kaleyra\u2019s customers and other users are ultimately responsible for compliance with Kaleyra\u2019s policies, and it does not systematically audit Kaleyra\u2019s customers or other users to confirm compliance with Kaleyra\u2019s policies. Kaleyra cannot predict whether Kaleyra\u2019s role in facilitating its customers\u2019 or other users\u2019 activities would expose Kaleyra to liability under applicable law. Even if claims asserted against Kaleyra do not result in liability, Kaleyra may incur substantial costs in investigating and defending such claims. If Kaleyra is found liable for its customers\u2019 or other users\u2019 activities, Kaleyra could be required to pay fines or penalties, redesign business methods or otherwise expend resources to remedy any damages caused by such actions and to avoid future liability.\nKaleyra may be subject to governmental export controls and economic sanctions regulations that could impair Kaleyra\u2019s ability to compete in international markets due to licensing requirements and could subject Kaleyra to liability if Kaleyra is not in compliance with applicable laws.\nCertain of Kaleyra\u2019s products and services may be subject to export control and economic sanctions regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration regulations, U.S. Customs regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. Exports of Kaleyra\u2019s products and the provision of Kaleyra\u2019s services must be made in compliance with these laws and regulations. Although Kaleyra takes precautions to prevent its products from being provided in violation of such laws, Kaleyra is aware of previous exports of certain of Kaleyra\u2019s products to a small number of persons and organizations that are the subject of U.S. sanctions or located in countries or regions subject to U.S. sanctions. If Kaleyra fails to comply with these laws and regulations, Kaleyra and certain of its employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including: the possible loss of export privileges; fines, which may be imposed on Kaleyra and responsible employees or managers; and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular deployment may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. In addition, changes in Kaleyra\u2019s products or services, or changes in applicable export or economic sanctions regulations may create delays in the introduction and deployment of Kaleyra\u2019s products and services in international markets, or, in some cases, prevent the export of Kaleyra\u2019s products or provision of Kaleyra\u2019s services to certain countries or end-users. Any change in export or economic sanctions regulations, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations,\ncould also result in decreased use of Kaleyra\u2019s products and services, or in its decreased ability to export Kaleyra\u2019s products or provide Kaleyra\u2019s services to existing or prospective customers with international operations. Any decreased use of Kaleyra\u2019s products and services or limitation on Kaleyra\u2019s ability to export its products and provide its services could harm Kaleyra\u2019s business.\nFurther, Kaleyra incorporates encryption technology into certain of its products. Various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit Kaleyra\u2019s customers\u2019 ability to import its products into those countries. Encryption products and the underlying technology may also be subject to export control restrictions. Governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of exports of encryption products, or Kaleyra\u2019s failure to obtain required approval for Kaleyra\u2019s products, when applicable, could harm Kaleyra\u2019s international sales and adversely affect Kaleyra\u2019s revenue. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the export of Kaleyra\u2019s products and provision of Kaleyra\u2019s services, including with respect to new releases of Kaleyra\u2019s products and services, may create delays in the introduction of Kaleyra\u2019s products and services in international markets, prevent Kaleyra\u2019s customers with international operations from deploying its products and using Kaleyra\u2019s services throughout their globally-distributed systems or, in some cases, prevent the export of Kaleyra\u2019s products or provision of Kaleyra\u2019s services to some countries altogether.\nIn addition, beginning in February 2022, the U.S., the United Kingdom, the European Union and other countries began imposing severe sanctions and export controls targeting Russia as a result of the armed conflict by Russia in Ukraine. We, our customers, and our business partners, will be required to comply with these and potential additional sanctions imposed by the U.S., the United Kingdom, the European Union and by other countries. Kaleyra reviews our contractual relationships with suppliers/customers to establish whether any are subject to the sanctions. In the unlikely event of that we identify a party with which we have a business relationship appearing on a sanctions list, we would immediately activate a legal analysis of what gives rise to the business relationship, including any contract, to estimate the most appropriate course of action to comply with the sanction regulations, together with the impact of a contractual termination according to the applicable law, and then proceed as required by the regulatory authorities , However, given the range of possible outcomes, the full costs, burdens, and limitations on our and our customer\u2019s and business partners\u2019 businesses are currently unknown and may become significant.\nKaleyra faces a risk of litigation resulting from customer misuse of Kaleyra\u2019s services and software to make or send unauthorized calls and/or text messages in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.\nCalls and/or text messages originated by Kaleyra\u2019s customers may subject Kaleyra to potential risks. For example, the TCPA restricts telemarketing and the use of technologies that enable automatic calling and/or text messages without proper consent. This may result in civil claims against Kaleyra and requests for information through third-party subpoenas or regulatory investigations. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the making and/or delivery of calls and/or text messages are continuously evolving and developing. If Kaleyra does not comply with these laws or regulations or if Kaleyra becomes liable under these laws or regulations due to the failure of Kaleyra\u2019s customers to comply with these laws by obtaining proper consent, Kaleyra could become subject to lawsuits, fines, civil penalties, potentially significant statutory damages, consent decrees, injunctions, adverse publicity, loss of user confidence in Kaleyra services, loss of users and other adverse consequences, which could harm Kaleyra\u2019s business.\nThe effects of increased regulation in the United States of IP-based service providers are unknown.\nWhile the FCC has to date generally subjected IP-based service providers to less stringent regulatory oversight than traditional common carriers, the FCC has imposed certain regulatory obligations on providers of voice-over-internet protocol (\u201cVoIP\u201d) services, including the obligations to contribute to the Universal Service Fund, to provide 911 services and/or to comply with the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act. Some states have imposed taxes, fees and/or surcharges on VoIP telephony services. The imposition of additional regulations could have a material adverse effect on Kaleyra\u2019s business.\nIf Kaleyra experiences fraudulent activity, Kaleyra could incur substantial costs.\nKaleyra\u2019s products may be subject to fraudulent usage, including but not limited to revenue share fraud, domestic traffic pumping, subscription fraud, premium text message scams and other fraudulent schemes. Although Kaleyra\u2019s customers are required to set passwords or personal identification numbers to protect their accounts, third parties have in the past been, and may in the future be, able to access and use their accounts through fraudulent means. Furthermore, spammers attempt to use Kaleyra\u2019s products to send targeted and untargeted spam messages. Kaleyra cannot be certain that its efforts to defeat spamming attacks will be successful in eliminating all spam messages from being sent using Kaleyra\u2019s Platforms. In addition, a cybersecurity breach of Kaleyra\u2019s customers\u2019 systems could result in exposure of their authentication credentials, unauthorized access to their accounts or fraudulent calls on their accounts, any of which could harm Kaleyra\u2019s reputation with its customers and result in the incurrence of substantial costs for Kaleyra.\nKaleyra may be liable for the information that content owners or distributors distribute over Kaleyra\u2019s network.\nThe law relating to the liability of private network operators for information carried on or disseminated through their networks remains unsettled. While Kaleyra disclaims any liability for third-party content in Kaleyra\u2019s services agreements, Kaleyra may become subject to legal claims relating to the content disseminated on Kaleyra\u2019s network, even though such content is owned or distributed by Kaleyra customers or a customer of Kaleyra customers. For example, lawsuits may be brought against Kaleyra claiming that material distributed using Kaleyra\u2019s network was inaccurate, offensive or violated the law or the rights of others. Claims could also involve matters such as defamation, invasion of privacy and copyright infringement. In addition, the law remains unclear over whether content may be distributed from one jurisdiction, where the content is legal, into another jurisdiction, where it is not. Companies operating private networks have been sued in the past, sometimes successfully, based on the nature of material distributed, even if the content is not owned by the network operator and the network operator has no knowledge of the content or its legality. It is not practical for Kaleyra to monitor all of the content distributed using Kaleyra\u2019s network. Kaleyra may need to take costly measures to reduce Kaleyra\u2019s exposure to these risks or to defend itself against such claims, which could increase Kaleyra\u2019s costs and harm its results of operations.\nKaleyra has never paid dividends on its common stock, and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future.\nKaleyra has never declared or paid cash dividends on its common stock. Kaleyra does not anticipate paying any cash dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future. Kaleyra currently intends to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of its business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of Kaleyra\u2019s common stock will be stockholders\u2019 sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nKaleyra has incurred significant indebtedness as a result of the acquisition of mGage, which could have a material adverse effect on Kaleyra\u2019s financial condition.\nIn connection with Kaleyra\u2019s acquisition of mGage, Kaleyra incurred $200 million in additional indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, Kaleyra\u2019s total consolidated long term indebtedness to banks and other lenders was approximately $22.9 million. Kaleyra may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy its obligations under indebtedness that may not be successful. The inability in the future to repay such indebtedness when due would have a material adverse effect on Kaleyra.\nKaleyra\u2019s indebtedness could have important consequences to its stockholders and the holders of its other securities including:\n\u2022\nincreasing Kaleyra\u2019s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring that a portion of Kaleyra\u2019s cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest on its debt, thereby reducing its ability to use its cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nlimiting Kaleyra\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nlimiting Kaleyra\u2019s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business;\n\u2022\nrestricting Kaleyra\u2019s ability or the ability to pay dividends or make other payments; and\n\u2022\nplacing Kaleyra at a competitive disadvantage to its competitors that have less indebtedness.\nKaleyra may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including secured indebtedness. If new indebtedness is added to Kaleyra\u2019s current indebtedness levels, the related risks that it faces could intensify.\nRisks Related to Kaleyra\u2019s Financial Controls\nKaleyra previously had material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. If Kaleyra\u2019s remediation of these material weaknesses is not effective or if Kaleyra experiences additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fails to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future, Kaleyra may not be able to produce timely and accurate consolidated financial statements and comply with applicable regulations, which may adversely affect investor confidence and the value of our common stock.\nPrior to the Business Combination, Kaleyra was a special purpose acquisition company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses. As a result, previously existing internal controls were no longer applicable or comprehensive enough since Kaleyra\u2019s operations before the Business Combination were insignificant compared to those of the consolidated entity after the Business Combination. During fiscal year 2020, Kaleyra implemented processes and controls as part of its remediation efforts to address material weaknesses that were identified during the assessment of the year ended December 31, 2019. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Following the remediation of the material weaknesses, Kaleyra\u2019s management concluded that Kaleyra\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.\nKaleyra cannot assure that the measures it has taken to date, and the further improvements to strengthen its internal controls that Kaleyra is continuing to implement, will be sufficient to avoid potential future material weaknesses. Accordingly, there could continue to be a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of Kaleyra\u2019s consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nIf Kaleyra fails to identify new material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, if Kaleyra is unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, if Kaleyra is unable to conclude that its internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if its independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting when Kaleyra is no longer an emerging growth company, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of Kaleyra\u2019s consolidated financial reports and the market price of Kaleyra\u2019s common stock could be negatively affected. As a result of such failures, Kaleyra could also become subject to investigations by the NYSE, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, and become subject to litigation from investors and stockholders, which could harm its reputation and financial condition or divert financial and management resources from Kaleyra\u2019s regular business activities.\nKaleyra must continue to develop effective business support systems to implement customer orders and to provide and bill for services.\nKaleyra depends on its ability to continue to develop effective business support systems. This complicated undertaking requires significant resources and expertise and support from third-party vendors. Following the development of the business support systems, the data migration must be completed for the full benefit of the systems to be realized. Business support systems are needed for:\n\u2022\nquoting, accepting and inputting customer orders for services;\n\u2022\nprovisioning, installing and delivering services;\n\u2022\nproviding customers with direct access to the information systems included in Kaleyra\u2019s Platforms so that they can manage the services they purchase from Kaleyra, generally through web-based customer portals; and\n\u2022\nbilling for services.\nBecause Kaleyra\u2019s business provides for continued rapid growth in the number of customers that Kaleyra serves, the volume of services offered, as well as the integration of any acquired companies\u2019 business support systems, if any, Kaleyra must continue to develop its business support systems on a schedule sufficient to meet proposed milestone dates. If Kaleyra fails to develop effective business support systems or complete the data migration into these systems, it could materially adversely affect Kaleyra\u2019s ability to implement its business plans, realize anticipated benefits from Kaleyra\u2019s acquisitions, if any, and meet Kaleyra\u2019s financial goals and objectives.\nRisks Related to Kaleyra\u2019s Corporate Structure and Securities\nStockholders of Kaleyra may not be able to enforce judgments entered by U.S. courts against certain of its officers and directors.\nKaleyra is incorporated in the State of Delaware. However, some of our directors and executive officers reside outside of the U.S. As a result, stockholders of Kaleyra may not be able to effect service of process upon those persons within the U.S. or enforce against those persons judgments obtained in U.S. courts.\nKaleyra\u2019s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit Kaleyra\u2019s stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with Kaleyra or its directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\nKaleyra\u2019s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in Kaleyra\u2019s name, actions against its directors, officers, and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and, if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder\u2019s counsel except any action (A) as to which the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, (C) for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction, or (D) any action arising under the Securities Act, as to which the Court of Chancery and the federal district court for the District of Delaware shall have concurrent jurisdiction. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of Kaleyra\u2019s capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in its second amended and restated certificate of incorporation. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with Kaleyra or any of its directors, officers, or employees which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims, although Kaleyra\u2019s stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. However, there is no assurance that a court would enforce the choice of forum provision contained in Kaleyra\u2019s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation. If a court were to find such provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, Kaleyra may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm its business, operating results and financial condition.\nKaleyra\u2019s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the exclusive forum provision will be applicable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\nThe future sales of shares by existing stockholders and future exercise of registration rights may adversely affect the market price of Kaleyra\u2019s common stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of Kaleyra\u2019s common stock in the public market could occur at any time. If Kaleyra\u2019s stockholders sell, or the market perceives that Kaleyra\u2019s stockholders intend to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nIn connection with their initial purchase of the Company\u2019s securities, the Company\u2019s initial stockholders were granted registration rights pursuant to the terms of a registration rights agreement. In connection with the Business Combination, the Company agreed to amend and restate this registration rights agreement with the Registration Rights Agreement. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, after the date of closing of the Business Combination, the sellers\u2019 representative under the Stock Purchase Agreement for the Business Combination, Cowen and Company, LLC (\u201cCowen\u201d) or the holders of at least a majority-in-interest of the then-outstanding shares issued to or issuable to the Company\u2019s initial stockholders, and the shares issued in the Business Combination (collectively, the \u201cBusiness Combination Registrable Securities\u201d) will be entitled to make up to three demands (not counting any demand by Cowen to register our securities) that we register the Business Combination Registrable Securities. Such registration rights are subject to certain requirements and limitations as set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement. In addition, and subject to certain requirements and limitations as set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement, the holders of the Business Combination Registrable Securities have certain \u201cpiggy-back\u201d registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our consummation of the Business Combination. The Business Combination Registrable Securities were registered in accordance with the \u201cpiggy-back\u201d registration rights for resale on a registration statement that the SEC declared effective in May 2020. The Company has also agreed to provide certain registration rights to unregistered shares of common stock and shares of common stock that may be issued pursuant to outstanding convertible notes with certain stockholders of the Company. Chardan Capital Markets, LLC, (\u201cChardan\u201d) currently holds 66,089 shares of common stock and a convertible note that is convertible at Chardan\u2019s option into 53,501 shares of common stock, all of which are subject to such registration rights.\nIn addition, Kaleyra issued 1,600,000 shares of Kaleyra common stock as partial consideration to the existing stockholders of Vivial in connection with the acquisition of mGage, and registered such transaction and issuance on a registration statement on Form S-4 on May 6, 2021. In connection with the acquisition, Kaleyra issued 8,400,000 shares of Kaleyra common stock to the PIPE Investors and the Merger Convertible Notes are convertible into up to 11,851,852 shares of Kaleyra common stock. Kaleyra registered the resale of the 8,400,000 shares of Kaleyra common stock issued to the PIPE Investors and the resale of the Kaleyra common stock issuable upon conversion of the Merger Convertible Notes (the \u201cResale Registration Statement\u201d). The Resale Registration Statement was declared effective in May 2021.\nConversion of the Merger Convertible Notes that were issued in connection with the acquisition of mGage will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the market price of Kaleyra common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of the Merger Convertible Notes issued in connection with the acquisition of mGage will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the shares of Kaleyra common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of Kaleyra common stock. In addition, the existence of the Merger Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Merger Convertible Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the Merger Convertible Notes into shares of Kaleyra common stock could depress the market price of Kaleyra common stock.\nWarrants are exercisable for Kaleyra\u2019s common stock, and upon any exercise would increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to Kaleyra\u2019s stockholders.\nKaleyra has outstanding issued warrants to purchase a total of 5,440,662 shares of common stock. Each whole warrant is exercisable to purchase one share of common stock at $11.50 per share. To the extent such warrants are exercised, additional shares of common stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to the then existing holders of the common stock and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of the common stock.\nKaleyra has no obligation to net cash settle the warrants.\nIn no event does Kaleyra have any obligation to net cash settle the warrants. Furthermore, there are no contractual penalties for failure to deliver securities to the holders of the warrants upon exercise of the warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless.\nCertain of our warrants are accounted for as a warrant liability and are recorded at fair value upon issuance with changes in fair value each period reported in earnings, which may have an adverse effect on the market price of Kaleyra common stock.\nKaleyra has 373,691 warrants outstanding as of December 31, 2021 that were issued in private placements that occurred concurrently with its initial public offering (the \u201cprivate warrants\u201d). These private warrants and the shares of Kaleyra common stock issuable upon the exercise of the private warrants are exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder\u2019s option, and are non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the private warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the private warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the warrants included in the units sold in the Company\u2019s initial public offering, in which case the 373,691 private warrants could be redeemed by the Company for $3,737. Under U.S. GAAP, Kaleyra is required to evaluate contingent exercise provisions of these warrants and then their settlement provisions to determine whether they should be accounted for as a warrant liability or as equity. Any settlement amount not equal to the difference between the fair value of a fixed number of Kaleyra\u2019s equity shares and a fixed monetary amount precludes these warrants from being considered indexed to its own stock, and therefore, from being accounted for as equity. As a result of the provision that the private warrants, when held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, will be redeemable by the Company, the requirements for accounting for these warrants as equity are not satisfied. Therefore, Kaleyra is required to account for these private warrants as a warrant liability and record (a) that liability at fair value, which was determined as the same as the fair value of the warrants included in the units sold in the Company\u2019s initial public offering, and (b) any subsequent changes in fair value as of the end of each period for which earnings are reported. As the fair value of the warrants was not considered material to the historical consolidated financial statements, it was recorded in the consolidated financial statements during the year ended December 31, 2021. The impact of changes in fair value on earnings may have an adverse effect on the market price of Kaleyra common stock.\nKaleyra may redeem the unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to warrant holders, thereby making the holders\u2019 warrants worthless.\nKaleyra has the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant, provided that the last reported sales price of the common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date Kaleyra sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. If and when the warrants become redeemable by Kaleyra, Kaleyra may exercise its redemption right even if it is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force holders (i) to exercise their warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for the holders to do so, (ii) to sell their warrants at the then-current market price when the holders might otherwise wish to hold their warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of the warrants. None of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by Kaleyra so long as they are held by their initial purchasers or their permitted transferees.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in the second amended and restated certificate of incorporation as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nThe second amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. Kaleyra is also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together these provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for Kaleyra\u2019s securities.\nThe fundamental change repurchase feature of the Merger Convertible Notes that were issued in connection with the acquisition of mGage may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over Kaleyra.\nThe terms of the Merger Convertible Notes require Kaleyra to repurchase the Merger Convertible Notes that were issued in connection with the acquisition of mGage for cash at the option of the holder in the event of a fundamental change and in certain circumstances require us to increase the conversion rate for conversions in connection with (i) a make-whole fundamental change or (ii) the delivery of a notice of redemption. A takeover of Kaleyra may trigger an option of the holder to require Kaleyra to repurchase the Merger Convertible Notes. These features may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of Kaleyra that would otherwise be beneficial to investors in the Merger Convertible Notes or Kaleyra\u2019s other securities.\nKaleyra\u2019s structure may be inefficient from a tax perspective.\nKaleyra S.p.A. is a controlled foreign corporation of Kaleyra for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This means that a substantial part of the net income, if any, of Kaleyra S.p.A. and its non-U.S. subsidiaries will be taxable to Kaleyra without regard to whether a dividend is paid to Kaleyra, subject to available foreign tax credits and a special deduction. Moreover, because Kaleyra S.p.A. has a U.S. subsidiary, the resulting structure (sometimes referred to as a \u201csandwich structure\u201d) would be subject to multiple levels of tax. Generally speaking, it is difficult to simplify a sandwich structure without incurring taxes in one or more jurisdictions. This corporate structure may have the effect of Kaleyra being required to pay more taxes than other companies with a simpler corporate structure.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIf Kaleyra is unable to expand or renew sales to existing clients, or attract new customers, Kaleyra\u2019s growth could be slower than it expects and its business may be harmed.\nKaleyra\u2019s future growth depends upon expanding sales of Kaleyra\u2019s technology offerings and services with existing customers and with new customers. Kaleyra\u2019s customers may not purchase Kaleyra\u2019s technology offerings and services, or Kaleyra\u2019s customers may reduce their purchasing volumes, if Kaleyra does not demonstrate the value proposition for their investment, and Kaleyra may not be able to replace existing customers with new customers. In addition, Kaleyra\u2019s customers may not renew their contracts with Kaleyra on the same terms, or at all, because of dissatisfaction with Kaleyra\u2019s service. If Kaleyra\u2019s customers do not renew their contracts, Kaleyra\u2019s revenue may grow more slowly than expected, may not grow at all, or may decline. Additionally, increasing incremental sales to Kaleyra\u2019s current client base may require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. Kaleyra plans to continue expanding its sales efforts but it may be unable to hire qualified sales personnel, may be unable to successfully train those sales personnel that Kaleyra is able to hire, and sales personnel may not become fully productive on the timelines that it has projected, or at all. Additionally, although Kaleyra dedicates significant resources to sales and marketing programs, these sales and marketing programs may not have the desired effect and may not expand sales. Kaleyra cannot make any assurances that its efforts will increase sales to existing customers or additional revenue. If Kaleyra\u2019s efforts to upsell to its customers are not successful, its future growth may be limited.\nKaleyra\u2019s ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future will also depend upon its ability to attract new customers. This may be particularly challenging where an organization has already invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate competing technology offerings and services into its business, as such organization may be reluctant or unwilling to invest in new technology offerings and services. If Kaleyra fails to attract new customers and maintain and expand those client relationships, its revenue may grow more slowly than expected and its business may be harmed.\nKaleyra\u2019s business depends on customers increasing their use of Kaleyra\u2019s services and any loss of customers or decline in their use of Kaleyra\u2019s services could reduce Kaleyra\u2019s profitability.\nKaleyra\u2019s ability to grow and generate incremental revenue depends, in part, on Kaleyra\u2019s ability to maintain and grow its relationships with existing customers and to have them increase their usage of Kaleyra\u2019s Platforms. If Kaleyra\u2019s customers do not increase their use of Kaleyra\u2019s services, then Kaleyra\u2019s revenue may decline and Kaleyra\u2019s results of operations may be harmed. Customers generally are charged based on the usage of Kaleyra\u2019s services. Many of Kaleyra\u2019s customers do not have long-term contractual financial commitments to Kaleyra and,\ntherefore, many of Kaleyra\u2019s customers may reduce or cease their use of Kaleyra\u2019s services at any time without penalty or termination charges. Kaleyra cannot accurately predict customers\u2019 usage levels and the loss of customers or reductions in their usage levels of Kaleyra\u2019s services may each have a negative impact on Kaleyra\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition and may cause Kaleyra\u2019s dollar-based net retention rate to decline in the future if Kaleyra\u2019s customers are not satisfied with Kaleyra\u2019s services. If a significant number of customers cease using, or reduce their usage of, Kaleyra\u2019s services, then Kaleyra may be required to spend significantly more on sales and marketing than Kaleyra\u2019s currently plan to spend in order to maintain or increase revenue from customers. Such additional sales and marketing expenditures could reduce Kaleyra\u2019s profitability and harm its business.\nDemand for Kaleyra\u2019s technology offerings and services could be adversely affected by volatile, negative, or uncertain economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on Kaleyra\u2019s customers\u2019 businesses.\nKaleyra\u2019s revenue and profitability depend on the demand for its technology offerings and services, which could be negatively affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond Kaleyra\u2019s control. Volatile, negative, or uncertain economic conditions affect Kaleyra\u2019s customers\u2019 businesses and the markets Kaleyra serves. Such economic conditions in Kaleyra\u2019s markets have undermined, and could in the future undermine, business confidence in Kaleyra\u2019s markets and cause Kaleyra\u2019s customers to reduce or defer their spending on new technology offerings and services, or may result in customers reducing, delaying or eliminating spending under existing contracts with Kaleyra, which would negatively affect Kaleyra\u2019s business. Growth in the markets Kaleyra serves could be at a slow rate, or could stagnate or contract, in each case for an extended period of time. Ongoing economic volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect Kaleyra\u2019s business in a number of other ways, including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build Kaleyra\u2019s revenue and resource plans.\nEconomic volatility and uncertainty are particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and changes in demand patterns resulting from these and other factors to manifest themselves in Kaleyra\u2019s business and results of operations. Changing demand patterns from economic volatility and uncertainty could harm Kaleyra\u2019s business and results of operations.\nBreaches of Kaleyra\u2019s networks or systems, or those of AWS or Kaleyra\u2019s other service providers, could compromise the integrity of its products, Platforms and data, result in significant data losses and otherwise harm its business.\nKaleyra depends upon its information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems to conduct virtually all of its business operations, ranging from Kaleyra\u2019s internal operations and research and development activities to its marketing and sales efforts and communications with Kaleyra\u2019s customers and business partners. Individuals or entities may attempt to penetrate Kaleyra\u2019s network security, or that of its Platforms, and to cause harm to Kaleyra\u2019s business operations, including by misappropriating its proprietary information or that of its customers, employees and business partners or to cause interruptions of Kaleyra\u2019s products and Platforms. In particular, cyberattacks and other malicious Internet-based activity continue to increase in frequency and in magnitude generally, and cloud-based companies have been targeted in the past. In addition to threats from traditional computer hackers, malicious code (such as malware, viruses, worms, and ransomware), employee theft or misuse, password spraying, phishing, credential stuffing, and denial-of-service attacks, Kaleyra also faces threats from sophisticated organized crime, nation-state, and nation-state supported actors who engage in attacks (including advanced persistent threat intrusions) that add to the risk to Kaleyra\u2019s systems (including those hosted on AWS or other cloud services), internal networks, its customers\u2019 systems and the information that they store and process. While Kaleyra devotes significant financial and personnel resources to implement and maintain security measures, because the techniques used by such individuals or entities to access, disrupt or sabotage devices, systems and networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, Kaleyra may be required to make further investments over time to protect data and infrastructure as cybersecurity threats develop, evolve and grow more complex over time. Kaleyra may also be unable to anticipate these techniques, and Kaleyra may not become aware in a timely manner of such a security breach, which could exacerbate any damage Kaleyra experiences. Additionally, Kaleyra depends upon its employees and contractors to appropriately handle confidential and sensitive data, including customer data, and to deploy Kaleyra\u2019s IT resources in a safe and secure manner that does not expose Kaleyra\u2019s network systems to security breaches or the loss of data. Any data security incidents, including internal malfeasance by its employees or a third party\u2019s fraudulent inducement of Kaleyra\u2019s employees to disclose information, unauthorized access or usage, virus or similar breach or disruption of Kaleyra\u2019s or its service providers, such as\nAWS or service providers, could result in loss of confidential information, damage to Kaleyra\u2019s reputation, erosion of customer trust, loss of customers, litigation, regulatory investigations, fines, penalties and other liabilities. Accordingly, if Kaleyra\u2019s cybersecurity measures or those of AWS or Kaleyra\u2019s service providers, fail to protect against unauthorized access, attacks (which may include sophisticated cyberattacks), compromise or the mishandling of data by Kaleyra\u2019s employees and contractors, then Kaleyra\u2019s reputation, customer trust, business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. While Kaleyra maintains errors, omissions, and cyber liability insurance policies covering certain security and privacy damages, Kaleyra cannot be certain that its existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover the potentially significant losses that may result from a security incident or breach or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim.\nKaleyra\u2019s investments in new services and technologies may not be successful.\nKaleyra continues to invest in new services and technologies. The complexity of these solutions, Kaleyra\u2019s learning curve in developing and supporting them, and significant competition in the markets for these solutions could make it difficult for Kaleyra to market and implement these solutions successfully. Additionally, there is a risk that Kaleyra\u2019s customers may not adopt these solutions widely, which would prevent Kaleyra from realizing expected returns on these investments. Even if these solutions are successful in the market, they still rely on third-party hardware and software and Kaleyra\u2019s ability to meet stringent service levels. If Kaleyra is unable to deploy these solutions successfully or profitably, it could adversely impact its business.\nIf Kaleyra fails to adapt and respond effectively to rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, changing regulations, and changing customer needs, requirements or preferences, Kaleyra\u2019s products may become less competitive.\nThe market for communications in general, and cloud communications in particular, is subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changing regulations, as well as changing customer needs, requirements and preferences. The success of Kaleyra\u2019s business will depend, in part, on Kaleyra\u2019s ability to adapt and respond effectively to these changes on a timely basis. If Kaleyra is unable to develop new products that satisfy Kaleyra customers and provide enhancements and new features for Kaleyra\u2019s existing products that keep pace with rapid technological and industry change, Kaleyra business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. If new technologies emerge that are able to deliver competitive products and services at lower prices, more efficiently, more conveniently or more securely, such technologies could adversely impact Kaleyra\u2019s ability to compete effectively.\nIf Kaleyra loses any of its key personnel or is unable to attract and retain the talent required for its business, Kaleyra\u2019s business could be disrupted and its financial performance could suffer.\nKaleyra\u2019s success is heavily dependent upon its ability to attract, develop, engage, and retain key personnel to manage and grow its business, including Kaleyra\u2019s key executive, management, sales, services, and technical personnel.\nKaleyra\u2019s future success will depend to a significant extent on the efforts of Kaleyra\u2019s executive team including the leadership of Kaleyra\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Dario Calogero, as well as the continued service and support of other key employees. Kaleyra\u2019s future success also will depend on its ability to attract and retain highly skilled technology specialists, engineers, and consultants, for whom the market is extremely competitive. All of Kaleyra\u2019s officers and key employees are at-will employees, meaning that they can terminate their employment with Kaleyra at any time. Kaleyra\u2019s inability to attract, develop, and retain key personnel could have an adverse effect on its relationships with its technology partners and customers and adversely affect Kaleyra\u2019s ability to expand its offerings of technology offerings and services. Moreover, Kaleyra\u2019s inability to train its sales, services, and technical personnel effectively to meet the rapidly changing technology needs of its customers could cause a decrease in the overall quality and efficiency of such personnel. Such consequences could harm Kaleyra\u2019s business.\nKaleyra\u2019s ability to attract and retain business and personnel may depend on its reputation in the marketplace.\nKaleyra believes its brand name and its reputation in the marketplace are important corporate assets that help distinguish Kaleyra\u2019s technology offerings and services from those of competitors and also contribute to Kaleyra\u2019s\nability to recruit and retain talented personnel, in particular its engineers and consulting professionals. However, Kaleyra\u2019s corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with customers, cybersecurity breaches, service outages, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures, or compliance violations. Similarly, Kaleyra\u2019s reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former customers, directors, employees, competitors, vendors, partners, Kaleyra\u2019s joint ventures or joint venture partners, adversaries in legal proceedings, legislators, or government regulators, as well as members of the investment community or the media. There is a risk that negative information about Kaleyra, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could adversely affect its business. Damage to Kaleyra\u2019s reputation could be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing customers reluctant to select Kaleyra for new engagements, resulting in a loss of business, and could adversely affect Kaleyra\u2019s recruitment and retention efforts. Damage to Kaleyra\u2019s reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of Kaleyra\u2019s brand name and could reduce investor confidence in Kaleyra, adversely affecting its share price.\nKaleyra has experienced rapid internal growth as well as growth through acquisitions in recent periods. If Kaleyra fails to manage its growth effectively, or its business does not grow as expected, Kaleyra\u2019s operating results may suffer.\nKaleyra\u2019s headcount and operations have grown substantially. Kaleyra had 564 employees as of December 31, 2021, as compared with 350 employees as of December 31, 2020. This growth has placed, and will continue to place, a significant strain on Kaleyra\u2019s operational, financial, and management infrastructure. Kaleyra anticipates further increases in headcount will be required to support increases in its technology offerings and continued expansion. To manage this growth effectively, Kaleyra must continue to improve its operational, financial, and management systems as well as controls by, among other things:\n\u2022\neffectively attracting, training, and integrating a large number of new employees, particularly technical personnel and members of Kaleyra\u2019s management and sales teams;\n\u2022\nfurther improving Kaleyra\u2019s key business systems, processes, and information technology infrastructure to support Kaleyra\u2019s business needs;\n\u2022\nenhancing Kaleyra\u2019s information and communication systems to ensure that Kaleyra\u2019s employees are well-coordinated and can effectively communicate with each other and Kaleyra\u2019s customers; and\n\u2022\nimproving Kaleyra\u2019s internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures to ensure timely and accurate reporting of Kaleyra\u2019s operational and financial results.\nIf Kaleyra fails to manage its expansion or implement Kaleyra\u2019s new systems, or if Kaleyra fails to implement improvements or maintain effective internal controls and procedures, Kaleyra\u2019s costs and expenses may increase more than expected and Kaleyra may not expand its client base, increase existing customer volumes and renewal rates, enhance its existing applications, develop new applications, satisfy its customers, respond to competitive pressures, or otherwise execute its business plan. If Kaleyra is unable to manage its growth, Kaleyra\u2019s operating results likely will be harmed.\nFuture acquisitions could disrupt Kaleyra\u2019s business and may divert management\u2019s attention, and if unsuccessful, harm Kaleyra\u2019s business.\nKaleyra may choose to expand by making acquisitions that could be material to its business. Acquisitions involve many risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nan acquisition may negatively affect Kaleyra\u2019s results of operations and financial condition because it may require Kaleyra to incur charges or assume substantial debt or other liabilities, may cause adverse tax consequences or unfavorable accounting treatment, may expose Kaleyra to claims and disputes by third parties, including intellectual property claims and disputes, or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset additional costs and expenses related to the acquisition;\n\u2022\nKaleyra may encounter difficulties or unforeseen expenditures in integrating the business, technologies, products, personnel, or operations of any company that it acquires, particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for Kaleyra;\n\u2022\nan acquisition may disrupt its ongoing business, divert resources, increase Kaleyra\u2019s expenses, or distract its management;\n\u2022\nan acquisition may result in a delay or reduction of client purchases for both Kaleyra and the company it acquired due to client uncertainty about continuity and effectiveness of service from either company;\n\u2022\nKaleyra may encounter difficulties in, or may be unable to, successfully sell any acquired technology offerings or services;\n\u2022\nan acquisition may involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which Kaleyra has little or no prior experience or where competitors have stronger market positions;\n\u2022\nthe challenges inherent in effectively managing an increased number of employees in diverse locations;\n\u2022\nthe potential strain on its financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures;\n\u2022\nthe potential known and unknown liabilities associated with an acquired company;\n\u2022\nKaleyra\u2019s use of cash to pay for acquisitions would limit other potential uses for its cash;\n\u2022\nif Kaleyra incurs additional debt to fund such acquisitions, such debt may subject Kaleyra to additional material restrictions on its ability to conduct its business as well as additional financial maintenance covenants;\n\u2022\nthe risk of impairment charges related to potential write-downs of acquired assets or goodwill in future acquisitions;\n\u2022\nto the extent that Kaleyra issues a significant amount of equity or equity-linked securities in connection with future acquisitions, existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease; and\n\u2022\nmanaging the varying intellectual property protection strategies and other activities of an acquired company.\nKaleyra may not succeed in addressing these or other risks or any other problems encountered in connection with the integration of any acquired business. The inability to integrate successfully the business, technologies, products, personnel, or operations of any acquired business, or any significant delay in achieving integration, could harm its business and results of operations.\nThe combination of the Kaleyra and mGage businesses may not lead to the growth and success of the combined business that Kaleyra believes will occur.\nAlthough Kaleyra believes the combination of the Kaleyra and mGage businesses provides a significant commercial opportunity for growth, Kaleyra may not realize all of the synergies that it anticipates and may not be successful in implementing its commercialization strategy. The combined business will be subject to all of the risks and uncertainties inherent in the pursuit of growth in the CPaaS industry and Kaleyra may not be able to successfully sell its and mGage\u2019s products and services, or realize the anticipated benefits expected as part of the combination of the two businesses. If Kaleyra is not able to grow the combined business as a commercial enterprise, its financial condition will be negatively impacted.\nAlthough Kaleyra expects to realize certain benefits as a result of the acquisition of mGage, there is the possibility Kaleyra may be unable to integrate successfully the business of mGage to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition or do so within the intended timeframe.\nFollowing the acquisition of mGage, Kaleyra is devoting significant management attention and resources to the integration of the business practices and operations of Kaleyra and mGage. Potential difficulties that Kaleyra may encounter as part of the integration process include the following:\n\u2022\nthe costs of integration and compliance and the possibility that the full benefits anticipated to result from the acquisition will not be realized;\n\u2022\nany delay in the integration of management teams, strategies, operations, products and services\u037e\n\u2022\ndiversion of the attention of management as a result of integrating the mGage business into Kaleyra\u037e\n\u2022\nlack of going-forward commitment of mGage customers, based on fatigue, loss of trust, disapproval or the directions of mGage pre-acquisition, or Kaleyra post-acquisition;\n\u2022\nloss of customers that will consider Kaleyra to be a competitor post-acquisition, or due to the acquisition of a customer by a competitor to Kaleyra;\n\u2022\ndifferences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies that may delay successful integration;\n\u2022\nthe ability to create and enforce uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems\u037e\n\u2022\nthe challenge of integrating complex systems, technology, networks and other assets of mGage into those of Kaleyra in a manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies\u037e\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the integration of mGage\u037e\n\u2022\nthe disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, our ongoing businesses; and\n\u2022\nthe potential unknown and undisclosed technical deficiencies and lack of required features and functionalities at the mGage products and services that will prevent the deployment and sale of those products and services. It is only through our interactions with the customers during the months following the acquisition that we will be able to define whether our products are salable and deployable whatsoever, or are not competitive, and hence will not be capable of generating meaningful revenue.\nAny of these factors could adversely affect the ability of Kaleyra to benefit financially from the acquisition of mGage, maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies or its ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of mGage or could reduce or even completely diminish the earnings or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of Kaleyra.\nKaleyra expects to continue incur additional integration and consolidation related costs related to the integration of the mGage business.\nKaleyra completed the acquisition of the mGage business on June 1, 2021. Kaleyra has incurred and expects to incur non-recurring costs associated with integrating the operations of mGage into its business. The amount of these costs could be material to the financial position and results of operations of Kaleyra. A substantial amount of such expenses includes facilities and systems consolidation costs, implementing integration plans, and employee-related costs. The combined company has and will continue to incur restructuring and integration costs in connection with the acquisition. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred, as there are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated in connection with the acquisition and the integration of the two companies\u2019 businesses. The elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, may not offset incremental transaction and other integration related costs in the near term or at all.\nKaleyra may not have discovered undisclosed liabilities and product deficiencies of mGage.\nKaleyra\u2019s due diligence review of mGage may not have discovered undisclosed liabilities and product and service deficiencies of mGage. If mGage has undisclosed liabilities or product or service deficiencies, Kaleyra as a successor owner may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities. Kaleyra has tried to control its exposure to undisclosed liabilities by obtaining certain protections as contemplated and provided for under the Merger Agreement, including representations and warranties from mGage regarding undisclosed liabilities, however, such representations and warranties expire by their terms on the completion of the Merger. There can be no assurance that such provisions in the Merger Agreement will protect Kaleyra against any undisclosed liabilities or product or service deficiencies being discovered or provide an adequate remedy for any undisclosed liabilities that are discovered. Such undisclosed liabilities could have an adverse effect on the business and results of operations of Kaleyra and may adversely affect the value of Kaleyra common stock after the consummation of the Merger.\nUncertainties associated with the integration of the mGage business may cause a loss of employees and may otherwise materially adversely affect the future business and operations of Kaleyra following the Merger.\nKaleyra\u2019s success depends upon the ability of Kaleyra to retain senior management and key employees of Kaleyra and mGage. In some of the fields in which Kaleyra and mGage operate, there are only a limited number of people in the job market who possess the requisite skills, and it may be increasingly difficult for Kaleyra to hire personnel over time. Kaleyra operates in many geographic locations where the labor markets, especially for software engineers, are particularly competitive.\nCurrent and prospective employees of Kaleyra and mGage may experience uncertainty about their roles with Kaleyra following the integration of the mGage business. In addition, key employees may depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with Kaleyra. The loss of services of certain senior management or key employees of Kaleyra and mGage or the inability to hire new personnel with the requisite skills could restrict the ability of Kaleyra to develop new products or enhance existing products in a timely manner, or to sell products to customers or to manage the business of Kaleyra following the integration effectively. Also, the business, financial condition and results of operations of Kaleyra following the integration could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of its key employees, by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position, or by Kaleyra\u2019s inability to attract and retain skilled employees, particularly engineers.\nKaleyra may experience quarterly fluctuations in its operating results due to a number of factors, which makes its future results difficult to predict and could cause its operating results to fall below expectations.\nKaleyra\u2019s quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and Kaleyra expects them to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of Kaleyra\u2019s control. As a result, Kaleyra\u2019s past results may not be indicative of its future performance and comparing Kaleyra\u2019s operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. In addition to the other risks described in this Annual Report, factors that may affect Kaleyra\u2019s quarterly operating results include:\n\u2022\nchanges in spending on collaboration and technology offerings and services by Kaleyra\u2019s current or prospective customers;\n\u2022\npricing Kaleyra\u2019s technology offerings and services effectively so that Kaleyra is able to attract and retain customers without compromising its operating results;\n\u2022\nattracting new customers and increasing Kaleyra\u2019s existing customers\u2019 use of Kaleyra\u2019s technology offerings and services;\n\u2022\nthe mix between wholesale and retail maintenance new contracts and renewals;\n\u2022\nclient renewal rates and the amounts for which agreements are renewed;\n\u2022\nseasonality and its effect on client demand;\n\u2022\nawareness of Kaleyra\u2019s brand;\n\u2022\nchanges in the competitive dynamics of Kaleyra\u2019s market, including consolidation among competitors or customers and the introduction of new technologies and technology enhancements;\n\u2022\nchanges to the commission plans, quotas, and other compensation-related metrics for Kaleyra\u2019s sales representatives;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of payment for operating expenses, particularly sales and marketing expense;\n\u2022\nKaleyra\u2019s ability to manage its existing business and future growth, domestically and internationally;\n\u2022\nunforeseen costs and expenses related to the expansion of Kaleyra\u2019s business, operations, and infrastructure, including disruptions in Kaleyra\u2019s hosting network infrastructure and privacy and data security; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions in Kaleyra\u2019s domestic and international markets.\nKaleyra may not be able to accurately forecast the amount and mix of future technology offerings and services, size or duration of contracts, revenue, and expenses and, as a result, Kaleyra\u2019s operating results may fall below its estimates. Risks related to confidentiality and security provisions or privacy laws will increase as Kaleyra continues to grow its cloud-based offerings and services and store and process increasingly large amounts of Kaleyra\u2019s customers\u2019 confidential information and data and host or manage parts of Kaleyra\u2019s customers\u2019 businesses, especially in industries involving particularly sensitive data such as the financial services industry and the healthcare industry. The loss or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data, including personal data, whether through breach of computer systems, systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, or otherwise, could damage Kaleyra\u2019s reputation and cause it to lose customers. Similarly, unauthorized access to or through Kaleyra\u2019s information systems and networks or those Kaleyra develops or manages for its customers, whether by Kaleyra\u2019s employees or third parties, could result in negative publicity, legal liability, and damage to Kaleyra\u2019s reputation, which could in turn harm Kaleyra\u2019s business and results of operations.\nIf Kaleyra causes disruptions in its customers\u2019 businesses or provides inadequate service, Kaleyra\u2019s customers may have claims for substantial damages against Kaleyra, which could cause Kaleyra to lose customers, have a negative effect on Kaleyra\u2019s reputation, and adversely affect its results of operations.\nIf Kaleyra makes errors in the course of delivering services for its customers or business partners, or fails to consistently meet its service level obligations or other service requirements of Kaleyra\u2019s customers, these errors or failures could disrupt Kaleyra\u2019s client\u2019s business, which could result in a reduction in its revenue or a claim for substantial damages against Kaleyra. In addition, a failure or inability by Kaleyra to meet a contractual requirement could subject Kaleyra to penalties, cause Kaleyra to lose customers or damage Kaleyra\u2019s brand or corporate reputation, and limit Kaleyra\u2019s ability to attract new business.\nThe services Kaleyra provides are often critical to Kaleyra\u2019s customers\u2019 businesses. Certain of Kaleyra\u2019s client contracts require Kaleyra to comply with security obligations including maintaining network security and backup data, ensuring Kaleyra\u2019s network is virus-free, maintaining business continuity planning procedures, and verifying the integrity of employees that work with Kaleyra\u2019s customers by conducting background checks. Any failure in a client\u2019s system, failure of Kaleyra\u2019s data center, cloud or other offerings, or breach of security relating to the services Kaleyra provides to the client could damage Kaleyra\u2019s reputation or result in a claim for substantial damages against Kaleyra. Any significant failure of Kaleyra\u2019s equipment or systems, or any major disruption to basic infrastructure in the locations in which Kaleyra operates, such as power and telecommunications, could impede Kaleyra\u2019s ability to provide services to Kaleyra\u2019s customers, have a negative impact on Kaleyra\u2019s reputation, cause Kaleyra to lose customers, and adversely affect its results of operations.\nUnder Kaleyra\u2019s client contracts, Kaleyra\u2019s liability for breach of its obligations is in some cases limited pursuant to the terms of the contract. Such limitations may be unenforceable or otherwise may not protect it from liability for damages. In addition, certain liabilities, such as claims of third parties for which Kaleyra may be required to indemnify its customers, are generally not limited under Kaleyra\u2019s contracts. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against Kaleyra in amounts greater than those covered by Kaleyra\u2019s current insurance policies could harm Kaleyra\u2019s financial condition. Even if such assertions against it are unsuccessful, Kaleyra may incur reputational harm and substantial legal fees.\nKaleyra\u2019s technology offerings and services could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or Kaleyra might lose its ability to utilize the intellectual property of others.\nKaleyra cannot be sure that its brand, technology offerings, and services, including, for example, the software solutions of others that Kaleyra offers to its customers, do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and these third parties could claim that Kaleyra or its customers are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. These claims could harm Kaleyra\u2019s reputation, cause Kaleyra to incur substantial costs or prevent Kaleyra from offering some services or solutions in the future or require Kaleyra to rebrand. Any related proceedings could require Kaleyra to expend significant resources over an extended period of time. In most of Kaleyra\u2019s contracts, Kaleyra agrees to indemnify its customers for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Any claims or litigation in this area, regardless of merit, could be time-consuming and costly, damage Kaleyra\u2019s reputation, and/or require Kaleyra to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to its customers. If Kaleyra cannot secure this right\nat all or on reasonable terms, or, alternatively, substitute a non-infringing technology, Kaleyra\u2019s business, results of operations, or financial condition could be harmed. Similarly, if Kaleyra is unsuccessful in defending a trademark claim, Kaleyra could be forced to re-brand, which could harm its business, results of operations, or financial condition. Additionally, in recent years, individuals and firms have purchased intellectual property assets where their sole or primary purpose is to assert claims of infringement against technology providers and customers that use such technology. Any such action naming Kaleyra or its customers could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against Kaleyra. Moreover, such an action could result in an injunction being ordered against Kaleyra\u2019s client or Kaleyra\u2019s own services or operations, causing further damages.\nIf Kaleyra is unable to protect its intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties, its business could be adversely affected.\nKaleyra\u2019s success depends, in part, upon its ability to protect its proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property. Existing laws offer only limited protection of Kaleyra\u2019s intellectual property rights, and the protection in some countries in which Kaleyra operates or may operate in the future may be very limited. Kaleyra relies upon a combination of confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, and trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws to protect its intellectual property rights. These laws are subject to change at any time and could further limit its ability to protect its intellectual property. There is uncertainty concerning the scope of available intellectual property protection for software and business methods, which are fields in which Kaleyra relies on intellectual property laws to protect its rights. The validity and enforceability of any intellectual property right Kaleyra obtains may be challenged by others and, to the extent it has enforceable intellectual property rights, those intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from reverse engineering its proprietary information or independently developing technology offerings and services similar to or duplicative of Kaleyra. Further, the steps Kaleyra takes in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of its intellectual property by competitors, former employees or other third parties, and Kaleyra might not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce, its intellectual property rights. Enforcing Kaleyra\u2019s rights might also require considerable time, money, and oversight, and Kaleyra may not be successful in enforcing its rights.\nKaleyra\u2019s use of open source software could negatively affect its ability to sell Kaleyra\u2019s products and subject Kaleyra to possible litigation.\nKaleyra\u2019s products and Platforms incorporate open source software, and Kaleyra expects to continue to incorporate open source software in its products and Platforms in the future. Few of the licenses applicable to open source software have been interpreted by courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on Kaleyra\u2019s ability to commercialize its products and Platforms. Moreover, although Kaleyra has implemented policies to regulate the use and incorporation of open source software into Kaleyra\u2019s products and Platforms, Kaleyra cannot be certain that it has not incorporated open source software in Kaleyra products or Platforms in a manner that is inconsistent with such policies. If Kaleyra fails to comply with open source licenses, Kaleyra may be subject to certain requirements, including requirements that it offer Kaleyra\u2019s products that incorporate the open source software for no cost, that Kaleyra make available source code for modifications or derivative works Kaleyra creates based upon, incorporating or using the open source software and that it license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of applicable open source licenses. If an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that Kaleyra has not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, Kaleyra could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from generating revenue from customers using products that contained the open source software and required to comply with onerous conditions or restrictions on these products. In any of these events, Kaleyra and its customers could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering Kaleyra\u2019s products and Platforms and to re-engineer Kaleyra\u2019s products or Platforms or discontinue offering its products to customers in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis. Any of the foregoing could require Kaleyra to devote additional research and development resources to re-engineer Kaleyra\u2019s products or Platforms, which could result in customer dissatisfaction and could harm Kaleyra\u2019s business.\nIf Kaleyra is unable to collect its receivables from, or bill its unbilled services to its customers, its business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nKaleyra\u2019s business depends on its ability to successfully obtain payment from its customers of the amounts they owe Kaleyra for technology offerings sold or services performed. Kaleyra typically evaluates the financial condition of its customers and usually bills and collects on relatively short cycles. Kaleyra maintains allowances against receivables and unbilled services. Actual losses on client balances could differ from those that Kaleyra currently anticipate and, as a result, Kaleyra might need to adjust its allowances. There is no guarantee that Kaleyra will accurately assess the creditworthiness of its customers. Macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for Kaleyra\u2019s customers, including limited access to the credit markets, insolvency, or bankruptcy, and, as a result, could cause customers to delay payments to Kaleyra, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase Kaleyra\u2019s receivables balance, or default on their payment obligations to Kaleyra. Timely collection of client balances also depends on Kaleyra\u2019s ability to complete its contractual commitments and bill and collect its contracted revenue. If Kaleyra is unable to meet its contractual requirements, it might experience delays in collection of and/or be unable to collect its client balances. In addition, if Kaleyra experiences an increase in the time to bill and to collect for its services, Kaleyra\u2019s cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nUnfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. Furthermore, the most recent global financial crisis caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn, including due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or one that could result from the recent military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, could result in a variety of risks to our business, including a reduced ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all. Furthermore, supply chain issues that developed in 2021, and the nature, magnitude, and duration of hostilities stemming from Russia\u2019s military conflict with Ukraine, including the effects of sanctions and retaliatory cyber-attacks on the world economy and markets, could negatively impact our business. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.\nKaleyra\u2019s products and Platforms and its business are subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those regarding data protection and information security, and Kaleyra customers may be subject to regulations related to the handling and transfer of certain types of sensitive and confidential information. Any failure of Kaleyra\u2019s products to comply with or enable its customers and channel partners to comply with applicable laws and regulations could harm Kaleyra\u2019s business.\nKaleyra and its customers that use Kaleyra\u2019s products may be subject to data protection-related laws and regulations that impose obligations in connection with the collection, processing and use of personal data, financial data, health or other similar data. The U.S. federal and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed limitations on, or requirements regarding, the collection, distribution, use, security and storage of personally identifiable information of individuals. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission and numerous state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards on the online collection, use and dissemination of data, and to the security measures applied to such data.\nSimilarly, many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the EU member states, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personally identifiable information obtained from individuals located in the EU or by businesses operating within their jurisdiction, which are often more restrictive than those in the U.S. laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of personally identifiable information that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, such as names, telephone numbers, message addresses and, in some jurisdictions, IP addresses and other online identifiers.\nFor example, in April 2016 the EU adopted the GDPR, which took full effect on May 25, 2018. GDPR enhances data protection obligations for businesses and requires service providers (data processors) processing personal data on behalf of customers to cooperate with European data protection authorities, implement security measures and keep records of personal data processing activities. Noncompliance with the GDPR can trigger fines equal to or greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of global annual revenues. Given the breadth and depth of changes in data\nprotection obligations, preparing to meet the requirements of GDPR has required significant time and resources, including a review of Kaleyra\u2019s technology and systems currently in use against the requirements of GDPR. There are also additional EU laws and regulations (and member states\u2019 implementations thereof) which govern the protection of consumers and of electronic communications. If Kaleyra\u2019s efforts to comply with GDPR or other applicable EU laws and regulations are not successful, Kaleyra may be subject to penalties and fines that would adversely impact Kaleyra\u2019s business and results of operations, and Kaleyra\u2019s ability to conduct business in the EU could be significantly impaired.\nFurthermore, outside of the EU, Kaleyra continues to see increased regulation of data privacy and security, including the adoption of more stringent subject matter specific state laws in the U.S. For example, on June 28, 2018, California enacted the CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase Kaleyra\u2019s compliance costs and potential liability. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent state privacy legislation in the U.S., which could increase Kaleyra\u2019s potential liability and adversely affect its business.\nKaleyra continues to see jurisdictions imposing data localization laws, which require personal information, or certain subcategories of personal information to be stored in the jurisdiction of origin. These regulations may inhibit Kaleyra\u2019s ability to expand into those markets or prohibit Kaleyra from continuing to offer services in those markets without significant additional costs. The uncertainty and changes in the requirements of multiple jurisdictions may increase the cost of compliance, delay or reduce demand for Kaleyra\u2019s services, restrict Kaleyra\u2019s ability to offer services in certain locations, impact Kaleyra\u2019s customers\u2019 ability to deploy its solutions in certain jurisdictions, or subject Kaleyra to sanctions, by national data protection regulators.\nAdditionally, although Kaleyra endeavors to have its products and Platforms comply with applicable laws and regulations, these and other obligations may be modified, they may be interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, and they may conflict with one another, other regulatory requirements, contractual commitments or Kaleyra\u2019s internal practices.\nKaleyra also may be bound by contractual obligations relating to its collection, use and disclosure of personal, financial and other data or may find it necessary or desirable to join industry or other self-regulatory bodies or other privacy- or data protection-related organizations that require compliance with their rules pertaining to privacy and data protection.\nKaleyra expects that there will continue to be new proposed laws, rules of self-regulatory bodies, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the U.S, the EU and other jurisdictions, and Kaleyra cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, rules, regulations and standards may have on Kaleyra\u2019s business. Moreover, existing U.S. federal and various state and foreign privacy- and data protection-related laws and regulations are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations, and various legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current or enact new laws and regulations regarding privacy- and data protection-related matters. Because global laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy and data security have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible that Kaleyra or its products or Platforms may not be, or may not have been, compliant with each such applicable law, regulation and industry standard and compliance with such new laws or to changes to existing laws may impact Kaleyra\u2019s business and practices, requires Kaleyra to expend significant resources to adapt to these changes, or to stop offering Kaleyra\u2019s products in certain countries. These developments could harm Kaleyra\u2019s business.\nAny failure or perceived failure by Kaleyra, its products or its Platforms to comply with new or existing U.S., EU or other foreign privacy or data security laws, regulations, policies, industry standards or legal obligations, or any security incident that results in the unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release or transfer of, personally identifiable information or other customer data may result in governmental investigations, inquiries, enforcement actions and prosecutions, private litigation, fines and penalties, adverse publicity or potential loss of business.\nKaleyra is subject to privacy and data security obligations in the U.S. Any failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or contractual obligations may harm Kaleyra\u2019s business. The Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d), other federal agencies or state attorneys general could fine or subject Kaleyra to other adverse actions that may negatively impact Kaleyra\u2019s business reputation. If Kaleyra is subject to an investigation or suffers a breach, Kaleyra may incur costs or be subject to forfeitures and penalties that could reduce Kaleyra\u2019s profitability.\nKaleyra is subject to privacy and data security laws and regulations that impose obligations in connection with the collection, processing and use of personal data. Federal and state laws or proposed laws impose limits on, or requirements regarding, the collection, distribution, use, security and storage of personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d) of individuals. Kaleyra sees increased regulation of data privacy and security, including the adoption of more stringent subject matter specific state laws in the U.S. For example, in 2018, California enacted the CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020. As discussed in the above Risk Factor, the CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase Kaleyra\u2019s compliance costs and potential liability. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent state privacy legislation in the U.S., which could increase Kaleyra\u2019s potential liability and adversely affect its business.\nKaleyra also may be bound by contractual obligations relating to Kaleyra\u2019s collection, use and disclosure of personal data or may find it necessary or desirable to join industry or other self-regulatory bodies or other privacy or security related organizations that require compliance with their rules pertaining to privacy and data protection.\nKaleyra is subject to individual or joint jurisdiction of the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission, and state attorneys general with respect to privacy and data security obligations. If Kaleyra was to suffer or if one of Kaleyra\u2019s customers were to suffer a breach, Kaleyra may be subject to the jurisdiction of a variety of federal agencies\u2019 jurisdictions as well as state attorneys general. Kaleyra may have to comply with a variety of data breach laws at the federal and state levels, comply with any resulting investigations, as well as offer mitigation to customers and potential end-users of certain customers to which Kaleyra provides services. Kaleyra could also be subject to fines, forfeitures and other penalties that may adversely impact Kaleyra\u2019s business.\nAny failure or perceived failure by Kaleyra, its products or its Platforms to comply with new or existing U.S. privacy or data security laws, regulations, policies, industry standards or contractual or legal obligations, or any security incident that results in the unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release or transfer of, PII or other customer data may result in governmental investigations, inquiries, enforcement actions and prosecutions, private litigation, fines and penalties, adverse publicity or potential loss of business.\nThe storage, processing and use of personal information and related data subjects Kaleyra to evolving governmental laws and regulation, commercial standards, contractual obligations and other legal obligations related to consumer and data privacy, which may have a material impact on Kaleyra\u2019s costs, use of Kaleyra\u2019s services, or expose Kaleyra to increased liability.\nU.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, commercial obligations and industry standards, each provide for obligations and restrictions with respect to data privacy and security, as well as the collection, storage, retention, protection, use, processing, transmission, sharing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other customer data, including customer proprietary network information under applicable federal law. The evolving nature of these obligations and restrictions subjects Kaleyra to the risk of differing interpretations, inconsistency or conflicts among countries or rules, and creates uncertainty regarding their application to Kaleyra\u2019s business.\nThese obligations and restrictions may limit Kaleyra\u2019s ability to collect, store, process, use, transmit and share data with Kaleyra\u2019s customers, employees and third-party providers and to allow Kaleyra\u2019s customers to collect, store, retain, protect, use, process, transmit, share and disclose data with others through Kaleyra\u2019s services. Compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such obligations and restrictions could increase the cost of Kaleyra\u2019s operations and impact its ability to market its services through effective segmentation.\nFailure to comply with obligations and restrictions related to applicable data protection laws, regulations, standards, and codes of conduct, as well as Kaleyra\u2019s own posted privacy policies and contractual commitments could subject Kaleyra to lawsuits, fines, criminal penalties, statutory damages, consent decrees, injunctions, adverse publicity, loss of user confidence in Kaleyra\u2019s services, and loss of users, which could materially harm Kaleyra\u2019s business. Because these obligations and restrictions have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible that Kaleyra may not be, or may not have been, compliant with each such obligation and restriction. Additionally, third-party contractors may have access to customer or employee data. If these or other third-party vendors violate obligations and restrictions related to applicable data protection laws or Kaleyra\u2019s policies, such violations may also put Kaleyra\u2019s customers\u2019 or employees\u2019 information at risk and could in turn harm Kaleyra\u2019s business.\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect Kaleyra\u2019s business, investments and results of operations.\nKaleyra is subject to laws, regulations and rules enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, Kaleyra is required to comply with certain SEC, the NYSE, the NYSE American and other legal or regulatory requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws, regulations and rules may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws, regulations and rules and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on Kaleyra\u2019s business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and rules, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on Kaleyra\u2019s business and results of operations.\nUnfavorable conditions in Kaleyra\u2019s industry or the global economy or reductions in spending on information technology and communications could lower Kaleyra\u2019s revenue and harm its business.\nKaleyra\u2019s results of operations may vary based on the impact of changes in Kaleyra\u2019s industry or the global economy on Kaleyra\u2019s customers. Kaleyra\u2019s results of operations depend in part on demand for information technology and cloud communications. In addition, Kaleyra\u2019s revenue is dependent on the usage of Kaleyra\u2019s products, which in turn is influenced by the scale of business that Kaleyra\u2019s customers are conducting. To the extent that weak economic conditions result in a reduced volume of business for, and communications by, Kaleyra\u2019s customers and prospective customers, demand for, and use of, Kaleyra\u2019s products may decline. Furthermore, weak economic conditions may make it more difficult to collect on outstanding trade receivables. Kaleyra has generated a portion of its revenue from small and medium-sized businesses, and Kaleyra expects this to continue to increase in the foreseeable future. Small and medium-sized business may be affected by economic downturns to a greater extent than enterprises, and typically have more limited financial resources, including capital borrowing capacity, than enterprises. If Kaleyra\u2019s customers reduce their use of Kaleyra\u2019s products, or prospective customers delay adoption or elect not to adopt Kaleyra products, as a result of a weak economy, this could lower Kaleyra\u2019s revenue and harm its business.\nKaleyra may require additional capital to support Kaleyra\u2019s business, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nKaleyra intends to continue to make investments to support Kaleyra\u2019s business and may require additional funds. In particular, Kaleyra may seek additional funds to develop new products and enhance Kaleyra\u2019s Platforms and existing products, expand Kaleyra\u2019s operations, including Kaleyra\u2019s sales and marketing organizations and Kaleyra\u2019s presence outside of the U.S., improve Kaleyra\u2019s infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses, technologies, services, products and other assets. In addition, Kaleyra may use a portion of its cash to satisfy tax withholding and remittance obligations related to outstanding restricted stock units. Accordingly, Kaleyra may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If Kaleyra raises additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, in addition to the Financing, Kaleyra\u2019s stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities Kaleyra issues could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of Kaleyra\u2019s common stock. Any debt financing that Kaleyra may secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to Kaleyra\u2019s capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for Kaleyra to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. Kaleyra may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to Kaleyra, if at all. If Kaleyra is unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to Kaleyra when Kaleyra requires it, Kaleyra\u2019s ability to continue to support its business growth, scale its infrastructure, develop product\nenhancements and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired and could harm Kaleyra\u2019s business.\nKaleyra\u2019s business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, floods and other natural catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as power disruptions, computer viruses, data security breaches or terrorism.\nA significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire or flood, occurring at Kaleyra\u2019s headquarters, at one of Kaleyra\u2019s other facilities or where a business partner is located could adversely affect Kaleyra\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, if a natural disaster or man-made problem were to affect Kaleyra\u2019s service providers, this could adversely affect the ability of Kaleyra\u2019s customers to use its products and Platforms. In addition, natural disasters and acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in Kaleyra\u2019s or its customers\u2019 businesses, national economies or the world economy as a whole. Kaleyra also rely on its network and third-party infrastructure and enterprise applications and internal technology systems for Kaleyra\u2019s engineering, sales and marketing, and operations activities. Although Kaleyra maintains incident management and disaster response plans, in the event of a major disruption caused by a natural disaster or man-made problem, Kaleyra may be unable to continue its operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in Kaleyra\u2019s development activities, lengthy interruptions in service, breaches of data security and the loss of critical data.\nIn addition, computer malware, viruses and computer hacking, fraudulent use attempts and phishing attacks have become more prevalent in Kaleyra\u2019s industry, have occurred on Kaleyra\u2019s Platforms in the past and may occur on Kaleyra\u2019s Platforms in the future. Though it is difficult to determine what, if any, harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security, integrity and availability of Kaleyra\u2019s products and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of Kaleyra\u2019s users may harm Kaleyra\u2019s reputation and Kaleyra\u2019s ability to retain existing users and attract new users.\nKaleyra is unable to predict the extent to which the global COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact Kaleyra\u2019s business operations, financial performance, results of operations and stock price.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to control its spread have, in the past and continue to, significantly curtail the movement of people, goods and services worldwide, including in most or all of the regions in which Kaleyra sells its products and services and conduct its business operations. Kaleyra also has its headquarters in Milan, Italy, which has been severely affected by the first wave of COVID-19 and the resulting government lockdowns to attempt to contain the spread of COVID-19. The fifth wave of COVID-19 triggered by the surge of the Omicron variant is currently affecting a large number of countries across the globe, and additional government restrictions are expected to reduce the resurgence in the pandemic infections. The magnitude and duration of the resulting decline in business activity cannot currently be estimated with any degree of certainty and threatens to (1) negatively impact the demand for its products and services, especially in those locations subject to \u201cshelter in place\u201d restrictions or similar government orders, (2) restrict its sales operations and marketing efforts, and (3) disrupt other important business activities in its various locations, some of which are also in areas affected by COVID-19. For example, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the emergence of the Omicron variant, certain industry events that Kaleyra sponsors or at which Kaleyra presents or at which we present and certain customer events have been canceled, postponed or moved to virtual-only experiences; Kaleyra is encouraging all of its employees to work remotely; and Kaleyra may deem it advisable to similarly alter, postpone or cancel entirely additional customer, employee or industry events in the future. Additionally, Kaleyra may see its services carrying less revenue-generating traffic in areas subject to \u201cshelter in place\u201d restrictions or related government orders as the population of those areas refrain from traveling and normal commerce activities. Accordingly, Kaleyra expects the COVID-19 pandemic to potentially have a negative impact on its sales and its results of operations in those areas adversely affected by COVID-19, the size and duration of which Kaleyra are currently unable to predict. In addition, Kaleyra\u2019s implementation of business continuity plans in a fast-moving public health emergency could have an adverse effect on its internal controls (potentially giving rise to significant discrepancies or material weaknesses) and increase our vulnerability to information technology and other systems discrepancies. Furthermore, concerns over the economic impact of COVID-19 have caused extreme volatility in financial and other capital markets which has and may continue to adversely impact Kaleyra\u2019s stock price and its ability to access capital.\nIf Kaleyra\u2019s goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, Kaleyra may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nKaleyra reviews its intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. As of December 31, 2021, Kaleyra carried a net $235.9 million of goodwill and intangible assets, net. An adverse change in market conditions, particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of Kaleyra\u2019s critical assumptions or estimates, could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an impairment charge to Kaleyra\u2019s goodwill or intangible assets. Any such charges may adversely affect Kaleyra\u2019s results of operations.\nChanges in the international and U.S. taxation business activities or the adoption of other tax reform policies could materially impact Kaleyra\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges to tax laws in jurisdictions where Kaleyra currently does business may be enacted in the future and could impact the tax treatment of Kaleyra\u2019s earnings. Due to the expansion of Kaleyra\u2019s business activities into new geographic regions, any changes in the taxation of such activities may increase Kaleyra\u2019s worldwide effective tax rate. An increase in overall tax rate could reduce Kaleyra\u2019s cash flow and lower Kaleyra\u2019s overall profitability.\nKaleyra\u2019s ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2021, Kaleyra had federal, state and foreign net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards totaling $157.9 million, $177.8 million and $5.4 million, respectively. However, Kaleyra\u2019s ability to utilize these NOLs to offset taxable income may be limited in the future. A corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is typically subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-ownership change NOLs to offset future taxable income. In general, under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders (generally 5% stockholders, applying certain look-through and aggregation rules) increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders\u2019 lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years). Purchases or sales of Kaleyra\u2019s common stock in amounts greater than specified levels could create a limitation on Kaleyra\u2019s ability to utilize our NOLs for tax purposes in the future. Limitations imposed on Kaleyra\u2019s ability to utilize NOLs could cause U.S. federal and state income taxes to be paid earlier than would be paid if such limitations were not in effect.\nFurthermore, Kaleyra may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize Kaleyra\u2019s NOLs before they expire. In addition, NOLs incurred in one state generally are not available to offset income earned in a different state and there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited for state tax purposes, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\nKaleyra\u2019s global operations and structure subject Kaleyra to potentially adverse tax consequences.\nKaleyra generally conducts Kaleyra global operations through subsidiaries and report Kaleyra\u2019s taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon Kaleyra\u2019s business operations in those jurisdictions. In particular, Kaleyra\u2019s intercompany relationships are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. Also, Kaleyra\u2019s tax expense could be affected depending on the applicability of withholding and other taxes (including withholding and indirect taxes on software licenses and related intercompany transactions) under the tax laws of certain jurisdictions in which Kaleyra has business operations. The relevant revenue and taxing authorities may disagree with positions Kaleyra has taken generally, or Kaleyra\u2019s determinations as to the value of assets sold or acquired or income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a disagreement were to occur, and Kaleyra\u2019s position were not sustained, Kaleyra could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability of Kaleyra\u2019s operations.\nCertain government agencies in jurisdictions where Kaleyra and its affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational companies. In addition, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development is conducting a project focused on base erosion and profit shifting in international structures, which seeks to establish certain international standards for taxing the worldwide income of multinational companies. As a result of these developments, the tax laws of certain countries in which Kaleyra and its affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could increase\nKaleyra\u2018s liabilities for taxes, interest and penalties, and therefore could harm Kaleyra\u2019s business, cash flows, results of operations and financial position.\nIf Kaleyra is not able to maintain and enhance Kaleyra\u2019s brand and increase market awareness of Kaleyra and its services, then Kaleyra\u2019s business could be harmed.\nKaleyra believes that maintaining and enhancing Kaleyra\u2019s brand identity and increasing market awareness of Kaleyra and its services are critical to achieving widespread acceptance of Kaleyra and its Platforms, as well as to strengthen Kaleyra\u2019s relationships with its existing customers and to Kaleyra\u2019s ability to attract new customers. The successful promotion of Kaleyra\u2019s brand will depend largely on Kaleyra\u2019s continued marketing efforts, Kaleyra\u2019s ability to continue to offer high quality services and Kaleyra\u2019s ability to successfully differentiate Kaleyra\u2019s services from competing products and services. Kaleyra\u2019s brand promotion activities may not be successful or yield increased revenue. In addition, independent industry analysts often provide reviews of Kaleyra\u2019s services and competing products and services, which may significantly influence the perception of Kaleyra\u2019s services in the marketplace. If these reviews are negative or not as strong as reviews of Kaleyra\u2019s competitors\u2019 services, then Kaleyra\u2019s brand may be harmed.\nFrom time to time, Kaleyra\u2019s customers have complained about Kaleyra\u2019s services. If Kaleyra does not handle customer complaints effectively, then Kaleyra\u2019s brand and reputation may suffer, Kaleyra\u2019s customers may lose confidence in Kaleyra and they may reduce or cease their use of Kaleyra\u2019s services. Kaleyra\u2019s success depends, in part, on Kaleyra\u2019s ability to generate positive customer feedback. Complaints or negative publicity about Kaleyra, its services or Platforms could harm Kaleyra\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers.\nThe promotion of Kaleyra\u2019s brand also requires Kaleyra to make substantial expenditures, and Kaleyra anticipates that these expenditures will increase as Kaleyra\u2019s market becomes more competitive and as Kaleyra expands into new markets. To the extent that these activities increase revenue, this revenue still may not be enough to offset the increased expenses Kaleyra incurs. If Kaleyra does not successfully maintain and enhance its brand, then Kaleyra\u2019s business may not grow, Kaleyra may see its pricing power reduced relative to competitors and Kaleyra may lose customers, all of which could lower Kaleyra\u2019s revenue and harm its business.\nAny failure to deliver and maintain high-quality customer support may adversely affect Kaleyra\u2019s relationships with its customers and prospective customers and could adversely affect Kaleyra\u2019s reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMany of Kaleyra\u2019s customers depend on Kaleyra\u2019s customer support team to assist them in deploying or using Kaleyra\u2019s services effectively, to help them resolve post-deployment issues quickly and to provide ongoing support. If Kaleyra does not devote sufficient resources or are otherwise unsuccessful in assisting Kaleyra\u2019s customers effectively, it could adversely affect Kaleyra\u2019s ability to retain existing customers and could prevent prospective customers from adopting Kaleyra\u2019s services. Kaleyra may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in demand for customer support. Kaleyra also may be unable to modify the nature, scope and delivery of its customer support to compete with changes in the support services provided by Kaleyra\u2019s competitors. Increased demand for customer support, without corresponding revenue, could increase Kaleyra\u2019s costs and harm its business and operations. Kaleyra\u2019s sales are highly dependent on Kaleyra\u2019s business reputation. Any failure to deliver and maintain high-quality customer support, or a market perception that Kaleyra does not maintain high-quality customer support, could harm Kaleyra\u2019s reputation and business.\nIndemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose Kaleyra to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses.\nKaleyra\u2019s agreements with customers and other third parties typically include indemnification or other provisions under which Kaleyra agrees to indemnify or otherwise be liable to them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, damages caused by Kaleyra to property or persons or other liabilities relating to or arising from Kaleyra\u2019s services or Platforms or other acts or omissions. The term of these contractual provisions often survives termination or expiration of the applicable agreement. Large indemnity payments or damage claims from a contractual breach could harm Kaleyra\u2019s business. Although Kaleyra normally contractually limit its liability with respect to such obligations, Kaleyra may still incur substantial liability related to\nthem. Any dispute with a customer with respect to such obligations could harm Kaleyra\u2019s relationship with that customer and other current and prospective customers and reduce demand for its services.\nKaleyra is subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business, and uninsured judgments or a rise in insurance premiums may adversely affect Kaleyra\u2019s results of operations.\nIn the ordinary course of business, Kaleyra is subject to various claims and litigation. Any such claims, regardless of merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources. In accordance with customary practice, Kaleyra maintains insurance against some, but not all, of these potential claims. Kaleyra may elect not to obtain insurance if Kaleyra believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. The levels of insurance Kaleyra maintains may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses or liabilities. Further, Kaleyra may not be able to maintain insurance at commercially acceptable premium levels or at all. If any significant judgment, claim (or a series of claims) or other event is not fully insured or indemnified against, it could have a material adverse impact on Kaleyra\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance as to the actual amount of these liabilities or the timing thereof. Kaleyra cannot be certain that the outcome of current or future litigation will not harm its business and results of operations.\nDefects or errors in Kaleyra\u2019s services could diminish demand for Kaleyra\u2019s services, harm Kaleyra\u2019s business and subject Kaleyra to liability.\nKaleyra\u2019s customers use its services for important aspects of their businesses, and any errors, defects or disruptions to Kaleyra\u2019s services and any other performance problems with Kaleyra\u2019s services could damage its customers\u2019 businesses and, in turn, hurt Kaleyra\u2019s brand and reputation. Kaleyra provides regular updates to Kaleyra\u2019s services, which have in the past contained, and may in the future contain, undetected errors, failures, vulnerabilities and bugs when first introduced or released. Real or perceived errors, failures or bugs in Kaleyra\u2019s services could result in negative publicity, loss of or delay in market acceptance of Kaleyra\u2019s Platforms, loss of competitive position, lower customer retention or claims by customers for losses sustained by them. In such an event, Kaleyra may be required, or may choose, for customer relations or other reasons, to expend additional resources in order to help correct the problem. In addition, Kaleyra may not carry insurance sufficient to compensate Kaleyra for any losses that may result from claims arising from defects or disruptions in Kaleyra\u2019s services. As a result, Kaleyra\u2019s brand and reputation could be harmed.\nIf Kaleyra does not file and maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, holders will only be able to exercise such warrants on a \u201ccashless basis.\u201d\nIf Kaleyra does not maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants at the time that holders wish to exercise such warrants, they will only be able to exercise them on a \u201ccashless basis\u201d provided that an exemption from registration is available. As a result, the number of shares of common stock that holders will receive upon exercise of the warrants will be fewer than it would have been had such holder exercised its warrant for cash. Further, if an exemption from registration is not available, holders would not be able to exercise on a cashless basis and would only be able to exercise their warrants for cash if a current and effective prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is available. Under the terms of the warrant agreement, Kaleyra has agreed to use its best efforts to meet these conditions and to maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants until the expiration of the warrants. However, Kaleyra cannot make any assurances that it will be able to do so. If Kaleyra is unable to do so, the potential \u201cupside\u201d of the holder\u2019s investment in Kaleyra may be reduced or the warrants may expire worthless.\nThere is no guarantee that the warrants will be in the money, and they may expire worthless and the terms of warrants may be amended.\nThe exercise price for the warrants is $11.50 per share of common stock. There is no guarantee that the public warrants will continue to be in the money prior to their expiration, and as such, the warrants may expire worthless.\nIn addition, the warrants were issued in registered form under a warrant agreement with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants to make any other change. Accordingly, Kaleyra may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants approve of such amendment. Although Kaleyra\u2019s ability to amend the terms of the warrants with the consent of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of shares and their respective affiliates and associates have of common stock purchasable upon exercise of a warrant.\nIf Kaleyra fails to introduce or acquire new products or services that achieve broad market acceptance on a timely basis, or if its products or services are not adopted as expected, Kaleyra will not be able to compete effectively.\nKaleyra operates in a highly competitive, quickly changing environment, and Kaleyra\u2019s future success depends on its ability to develop or acquire, and introduce new products and services that achieve broad market acceptance. Kaleyra\u2019s ability to successfully introduce and market new products is unproven. Because Kaleyra has a limited operating history and the market for its products, including newly acquired or developed products, is rapidly evolving, it is difficult to predict Kaleyra\u2019s operating results, particularly with respect to any new products that it may introduce. Kaleyra\u2019s future success will depend in large part upon its ability to identify demand trends in the market in which it will operate and quickly develop or acquire, and design, manufacture and sell, products and services that satisfy these demands in a cost-effective manner.\nIn order to differentiate Kaleyra\u2019s products and services from competitors\u2019 products, Kaleyra will need to increase focus and capital investment in research and development, including software development. If any products currently sold by, and services offered by, Kaleyra do not continue, or if Kaleyra\u2019s new products or services fail to achieve widespread market acceptance, or if Kaleyra is unsuccessful in capitalizing on opportunities in the market in which Kaleyra operates, our future growth may be slowed and its business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Successfully predicting demand trends is difficult, and it is very difficult to predict the effect that introducing a new product or service will have on existing product or service sales. It is possible that Kaleyra may not be successful with its new products and services, and as a result Kaleyra\u2019s future growth may be slowed and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Also, Kaleyra may not be able to respond effectively to new product or service announcements by competitors by quickly introducing competitive products and services.\nIn addition, Kaleyra may acquire companies and technologies in the future. In these circumstances, Kaleyra may not be able to successfully manage integration of the new product and service lines with our existing suite of products and services. If Kaleyra is unable to effectively and successfully further develop these new product and service lines, Kaleyra may not be able to increase or maintain sales (as compared to sales of Kaleyra on a standalone basis), and our gross margin (as compared to sales of Kaleyra on a standalone basis) may be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, the success of Kaleyra\u2019s new products will depend on several factors, including, but not limited to, market demand costs, timely completion and introduction of these products, prompt resolution of any defects or bugs in these products, Kaleyra\u2019s ability to support these products, differentiation of new products from those of the Kaleyra\u2019s competitors, market acceptance of these products, delays and quality issues in releasing new products and services. The occurrence of one or more of the foregoing factors may result in lower quarterly revenue than expected, and Kaleyra may in the future experience product or service introductions that fall short of its projected rates of market adoption.\nIf Kaleyra\u2019s products fail to achieve and sustain sufficient market acceptance, Kaleyra\u2019s revenue will be adversely affected.\nKaleyra\u2019s success will depend on its ability to develop and market products that are recognized and accepted as reliable, enabling and cost-effective. Some potential customers of Kaleyra may already use products similar to what Kaleyra currently offers and similar to what Kaleyra may offer in the future and may be reluctant to replace\nthose products with what Kaleyra currently offers or which Kaleyra may offer in the future. Market acceptance of Kaleyra\u2019s products and technology will depend on many factors, including Kaleyra\u2019s ability to convince potential customers that Kaleyra\u2019s products and technology are an attractive alternative to existing products and technology. Prior to adopting Kaleyra\u2019s products and technology, some potential customers may need to devote time and effort to testing and validating Kaleyra\u2019s systems. Any failure of Kaleyra\u2019s systems to meet these customer benchmarks could result in potential customers choosing to retain their existing systems or to purchase systems other than Kaleyra\u2019s.\nIf Kaleyra\u2019s performance does not meet the expectations of investors, stockholders or financial analysts, the market price of its securities may decline.\nIf Kaleyra\u2019s performance does not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the market price of its securities may decline. In addition, fluctuations in the price of Kaleyra\u2019s securities could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment. The trading price of Kaleyra\u2019s securities could be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond Kaleyra\u2019s control. Any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on your investment in Kaleyra\u2019s securities and these securities may trade at prices significantly below the price you paid for them. In such circumstances, the trading price of Kaleyra\u2019s securities may not recover and may experience a further decline.\nFactors affecting the trading price of Kaleyra\u2019s securities may include:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in Kaleyra\u2019s quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to Kaleyra;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market\u2019s expectations about Kaleyra\u2019s operating results;\n\u2022\nsuccess of competitors;\n\u2022\nKaleyra\u2019s operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning Kaleyra or the market in general;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to Kaleyra\u2019s;\n\u2022\nKaleyra\u2019s ability to market new and enhanced services and products on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting Kaleyra\u2019s business;\n\u2022\ncommencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving Kaleyra;\n\u2022\nchanges in Kaleyra\u2019s capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u2022\nthe volume of shares of Kaleyra\u2019s securities available for public sale;\n\u2022\nany major change in the Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) or management;\n\u2022\nsales of substantial amounts of common stock by Kaleyra\u2019s directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.\nBroad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of Kaleyra\u2019s securities irrespective of its operating performance. The stock market in general and the NYSE have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of Kaleyra\u2019s securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for retail stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to Kaleyra could depress its stock price regardless of its business, prospects,\nfinancial condition or results of operations. A decline in the market price of Kaleyra\u2019s securities also could adversely affect its ability to issue additional securities and its ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nIf securities or industry analysts cease publishing research or reports about Kaleyra, its business, or its market, or if they change their recommendations regarding its securities adversely, the price and trading volume of its securities could decline.\nThe trading market for Kaleyra\u2019s securities will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about Kaleyra, its business, its market, or its competitors. If any of the analysts who currently or in the future may cover Kaleyra, change their recommendation regarding its stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about Kaleyra\u2019s competitors, the price of its securities would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover Kaleyra were to cease coverage of Kaleyra or fail to regularly publish reports on it, Kaleyra could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause its stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThere may be a limited public market for the shares of common stock of Kaleyra, and the ability of the stockholders of Kaleyra to dispose of their common stock may be limited.\nKaleyra\u2019s common stock is traded on the NYSE. Kaleyra cannot foresee the degree of liquidity that will be associated with its common stock. A holder of the common stock may not be able to liquidate his, her or its investment in a short time period or at the market prices that currently exist at the time the holder decides to sell. The market price for the common stock may fluctuate in the future, and such volatility may bear no relation to Kaleyra\u2019s performance.\nA market for Kaleyra\u2019s securities may not continue, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of its securities.\nThe price of Kaleyra\u2019s securities may fluctuate significantly due to the market\u2019s reaction to Kaleyra and general market and economic conditions. An active trading market for Kaleyra\u2019s securities may never develop or, if developed, it may not be sustained. In addition, the price of Kaleyra\u2019s securities can vary due to general economic conditions and forecasts, Kaleyra\u2019s general business condition and the release of its financial reports. Additionally, if Kaleyra\u2019s securities become delisted from the NYSE for any reason, and are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, an inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities that is not a national securities exchange, the liquidity and price of Kaleyra\u2019s securities may be more limited than if its securities were quoted or listed on the NYSE or another national securities exchange. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established or sustained.\nThere can be no assurance that Kaleyra will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of the NYSE and the NYSE American.\nKaleyra\u2019s common stock is currently listed on the NYSE and its warrants on the NYSE American. If the NYSE or NYSE American delists Kaleyra\u2019s securities from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the listing standards, Kaleyra and its stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences including:\n\u2022\na limited availability of market quotations for Kaleyra\u2019s securities;\n\u2022\na determination that the common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in its common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for the common stock;\n\u2022\na limited amount of analyst coverage; and\n\u2022\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nKaleyra qualifies as an emerging growth company, and Kaleyra\u2019s decision to comply with reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nKaleyra is an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and, for as long as Kaleyra continues to be an emerging growth company, Kaleyra currently intends to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to have its independent registered public accounting firm audit Kaleyra\u2019s internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its registration statements, periodic reports and proxy statements (including the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part) and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Kaleyra will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of: (i) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the IPO; (ii) the first fiscal year after its annual gross revenue is $1.07 billion or more; (iii) the date on which Kaleyra has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; or (iv) the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of its common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year.\nKaleyra cannot predict whether investors will find its common stock less attractive if Kaleyra chooses to rely on these exemptions while Kaleyra is an emerging growth company. If some investors find its common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for its common stock and the price of its common stock may be more volatile.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. Kaleyra has availed itself of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, Kaleyra may not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.", "PERMNO": 17245, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "KLR"}
