{"cik": "911649", "company": "SPECIAL DIVERSIFIED OPPORTUNITIES INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nNote: In addition to the risk factors identified in this Section 1A, there are numerous other risks associated with the consummation of the transactions described above under \u201cRecent Developments.\u201d As and when such transactions are consummated, we will update our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to describe such risks.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur stockholders have not received and may not receive any of the proceeds of the Asset Sale.\nThe cash purchase price for the Life Sciences Business was paid directly to the Company. None of the net proceeds of the purchase price will be received by our stockholders, unless our Board ultimately proposes, and our stockholders approve, a distribution of the assets of the Company to the stockholders.\nThe Purchaser did not assume any of the excluded liabilities under the Asset Purchase Agreement.\nUnder the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser did not assume all of the liabilities associated with our Life Sciences Business. Certain liabilities remained with us post-closing. For example, Purchaser did not assume any liabilities arising out of, relating to or resulting or accruing from or with respect to the Life Sciences Business prior to the closing date. Such liabilities, together with other excluded liabilities under the asset purchase agreement, could be significant. While we believe that we are adequately insured against certain of the risks associated with such excluded liabilities, there can be no assurances.\nOur common stock was delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market following the Asset Sale, and there may be reduced ability to trade our common stock.\nBecause we no longer had an operating business immediately following the Asset Sale Transaction, we were notified that, in NASDAQ\u2019s view, we no longer satisfied the continued listing standards of the NASDAQ Capital Market, and our common stock was delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market pursuant to NASDAQ\u2019s authority under NASDAQ Listing Rule 5101. While trading of our common stock is currently conducted in the over-the-counter market on the OTC Bulletin Board, such trading could substantially reduce the market liquidity of our common stock. As a result, an investor may find it more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate quotations for the price of, our common stock.\nWe might not generate revenue following the Asset Sale Transaction and, if we do, any such revenue will be unpredictable.\nThe Life Sciences Business sold to the Purchaser represented substantially all of our revenue-generating assets. Following the Asset Sale, we may never generate revenue. Our revenues in the future, if any, will be unpredictable. Conversely, during the immediate future, we will continue to incur certain expenses of operating our business as a public company.\nWe are precluded from competing in certain areas of the Life Sciences Business for five years following the consummation of the Asset Sale.\nWe have agreed to be bound by a non-competition covenant in the Asset Purchase Agreement which precludes our ability to re-enter the antibody and assay design business (as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement) during the five years following the consummation of the Asset Sale.\nFailure to successfully identify and enter into a new line of business or identify possible acquisition candidates could cause our stock price to decline.\nSince the close of the Asset Sale, we have been exploring strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value going forward, including deploying the proceeds of the Asset Sale in seeking business acquisition opportunities, a merger with another company, or other actions to redeploy our capital, including, without limitation, distribution of cash to our stockholders. In furtherance of these efforts, we have entered into the agreements described above under Item 1, \u201cBusiness\u2009-\u2009Recent Developments.\u201d In relation to pursuing such strategic alternatives and new business acquisition opportunities, including those referred to in the previous sentence, our stock price may decline due to any or all of the following potential occurrences:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to identify a profitable new line of business or deploy successfully our resources to operate profitably in such line of business; and\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates or may not be able to acquire suitable candidates with our limited financial resources.\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to consummate any transactions that we announce.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or business and investment opportunities.\nThere is no guarantee that we will be able to identify such new business acquisition opportunities or strategic alternatives in which we may redeploy our assets and the proceeds of the Asset Sale. If we are unable to identify new business opportunities or acquire suitable acquisition candidate(s), or to consummate any transactions that we announce, we may continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flows, and our results of operations and stock price may suffer.\nOur shareholders are subject to the broad discretion of our Board.\nFollowing the closing of the Asset Sale, we have essentially no operating assets, and our business strategy is primarily identifying new business and investment opportunities. Our stockholders may not have an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any such proposed transactions or investments. As a result, our stockholders may be dependent on the broad discretion and judgment of our Board in\nconnection with the application of our capital and the selection of acquisition or investment targets, or any proposal that our Board may make to our stockholders that they approve, a distribution of the assets of the Company to the stockholders. There can be no assurance that determinations ultimately made by us will permit us to achieve profitable operations.\nWe will incur significant costs in connection with our evaluation of new business opportunities and suitable acquisition candidates.\nOur Board is in the process of identifying, analyzing and evaluating potential new business opportunities, including possible acquisition and merger candidates, and intends to continue to do so. We will incur significant costs, such as due diligence and legal and other professional fees and expenses, as part of these efforts. Notwithstanding these efforts and expenditures, we cannot give any assurance that we will identify an appropriate new business opportunity, or any acquisition opportunity, in the near term, or at all.\nWe will likely have no operating history in our new line of business, which is yet to be determined, and therefore we will be subject to the risks inherent in establishing a new business.\nWe have not identified what, if anything, our new line or lines of business will be and, therefore, we cannot fully describe the specific risks presented by such business. It is likely that we will have had no operating history in the new line of business, and it is possible that any company we may acquire will have a limited operating history in its business. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our future operations will generate operating or net income, and as such our success will be subject to the risks, expenses, problems and delays inherent in establishing a new line of business for us. The ultimate success of such new business cannot be assured.\nFollowing the closing of the Asset Sale, we became a \u201cshell company\u201d under the federal securities laws.\nThe Life Sciences Business constituted our only operating business, and accordingly, after the closing of the Asset Sale, we became a shell company as defined by Rule 405 of the Securities Act and Exchange Act Rule 12b-2. Applicable securities rules prohibit shell companies from using a Form S-8 registration statement to register securities pursuant to employee compensation plans and from utilizing Form S-3 for the registration of securities for so long as we would be a shell company and for 12 months thereafter.\nAdditionally, Form 8-K requires shell companies to provide more detailed disclosure upon completion of a transaction that causes it to cease being a shell company. To the extent that we acquire a business in the future, we would be required to file a current report on Form 8-K containing the financial and other information required in a registration statement on Form 10 within four business days following completion of such a transaction.\nTo assist the Securities and Exchange Commission in the identification of shell companies, we are required to check a box on our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our annual reports on Form 10-K indicating that we are a shell company.\nTo the extent that we would be required to comply with additional disclosure because we are a shell company, we might be delayed in executing any mergers or acquiring other assets that would cause us to cease being a shell company. In addition, under Rule 144 of the Securities Act, a holder of restricted securities of a \u201cshell company\u201d is not allowed to resell their securities in reliance upon Rule 144. Preclusion from any prospective purchase using the exemptions from registration afforded by Rule 144 might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future and the inability to utilize registration statements on Forms S-8 and S-3 would likely increase our costs to register securities in the future. Additionally, the loss of the use of Rule 144 and Forms S-3 and S-8 might make investments in our securities less attractive to investors and might make the offering and sale of our securities to employees, directors and others under compensatory arrangements more expensive and less attractive to recipients.\nFuture acquisitions and business combinations that we consummate may be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or divert management attention.\nWe may consider making acquisitions and entering into business combinations, investments, joint ventures or other strategic alliances with other companies. We may have to issue debt or equity securities to pay for future acquisitions, which could be dilutive to our then current stockholders. We cannot assure you that we will consummate any transactions in the future. However, these transactions create risks, such as:\n\u2022\ndifficulty assimilating the operations, technology and personnel of the combined companies;\n\u2022\ndisrupting the business we may acquire;\n\u2022\nproblems retaining key technical and managerial personnel of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nadditional operating losses and expenses of acquired businesses; and\n\u2022\nimpairment of relationships with existing employees, customers and business partners of the acquired business.\nAny of the events described in the foregoing paragraph could have an adverse effect on the combined business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf we do not produce future taxable income, our ability to realize the benefits of our net operating loss carryforwards could be significantly reduced.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards, including those acquired in the Company\u2019s past acquisitions, of approximately $22.4 million, which, if not utilized, begin to expire as follows:\nThe Tax Reform Act of 1986 (the \u201cAct\u201d) limits the annual use of net operating loss and income tax credit carryforwards after certain ownership changes, as defined by the Act. The application of these limits, or the application of certain other statutory or regulatory requirements for the utilization of net operating losses and income tax credit carryforwards, could significantly restrict our ability to utilize carryforwards. Certain of our total net operating loss carryforwards from 2000 and prior years are subject to limitations on their annual use since a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50% has occurred within a three-year period with respect to those net operating loss carryforwards. The Company has determined that no limitations on net operating loss carryforwards exist for the years expiring 2022 through 2031 (tax years 2001 through 2012).\nBased on the best information available to us today, we do not have sufficient future taxable income to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwards prior to their expiration, and we have established a full valuation allowance against these net operating loss and income tax credit carryforwards for financial reporting purposes.\nCertain of our shareholders are able to significantly influence proposals for a change in control or other matters requiring a shareholder vote.\nOne shareholder held approximately 34.5% of our common stock as of March 15, 2017. Due to this concentration of ownership, this shareholder can substantially influence all matters requiring a stockholder vote, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nthe election of directors\n\u2022\nthe amendment of our organizational documents; or\n\u2022\nthe approval of a merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction.\nProvisions in our organizational documents could prevent or frustrate attempts by stockholders to replace our current management.\nOur certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our Board. Our certificate of incorporation provides for a staggered board and removal of directors only for cause. Accordingly, stockholders may elect only a portion of our board at any annual meeting, which may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in management. In addition, under our certificate of incorporation, our Board of Directors may issue additional shares of preferred stock, which could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby effect a change in the composition of our Board of Directors. Our bylaws require advance notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations and permit only our President or a majority of the Board of Directors to call a special stockholder meeting. These provisions may have the effect of preventing or hindering attempts by our stockholders to replace our current management. In addition, our certificate of incorporation contains provisions that limit our ability to engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of our capital stock unless, among other possibilities, the Board of Directors approves the transaction. These provisions may have the effect of preventing or hindering a change of control of our company.\nOur stock has generally had low trading volume, and its public trading price has been volatile.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the price of our common stock fluctuated between $0.83 and $1.18 per share, with an average daily trading volume for the year of approximately 28,000 shares. The market may experience significant price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies.", "PERMNO": 79689, "SIC": 5190, "TIC": "SDI"}
