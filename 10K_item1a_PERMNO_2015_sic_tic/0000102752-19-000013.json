Risk Factors\nOur future results may differ materially from past results and from those projected in the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K due to various uncertainties and risks, including those risks set forth below, nonrecurring events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in our other reports filed with the SEC.\nUncertain government budgets and shifting government priorities could delay contract awards and funding and adversely affect our ability to continue work under our government contracts. Additionally, federal procurement directives could result in our loss of work on current programs to small business set-asides and large multiple award contracts.\nOur government business is subject to funding delays, terminations (including at the government's convenience), reductions, in-sourcing, extensions and moratoriums associated with the government\u2019s budgeting and contracting process. The federal procurement environment is unpredictable and could adversely affect our ability to perform work under new and existing contracts. We have experienced delays in contract awards and funding on our contracts in recent years that have adversely affected our ability to continue existing work and to replace expiring work. Additionally, our government business is subject to the risk that one or more of our potential contracts or contract extensions may be diverted by the contracting agency to a small or disadvantaged or minority-owned business pursuant to set-aside programs administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration, or may be bundled into large multiple award contracts for very large businesses. These risks can potentially have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profit margins.\nIncreased market competition resulting from decreases in government spending for contract services and government contracting award criteria could adversely affect our ability to sustain our revenue levels.\nPressure on government budgets may adversely affect the flow of work to federal contractors, particularly new programs. Competitor contractors that experience a loss of government work have tended to redirect their marketing efforts toward the types of work that we perform. This increase in competition for our service offerings has adversely affected our ability to win new work or successor contracts to continue work that is currently performed by us under expiring contracts. Unsuccessful bidders frequently protest contract awards, which can delay or reverse the contract awards. Additionally, the government has frequently used contract award criteria that emphasizes lowest price, technically acceptable bids, which further intensifies competition in our government markets.\nCertain programs comprise a material portion of our revenue. Our work on large government programs presents a risk to revenue growth and sustainability and profit margins.\nThe eventual expiration of large government programs or the loss of or disruption of revenues on a single contract may reduce our revenues and profits. Such revenue losses could also erode profits on our remaining programs that would have to absorb a larger portion of the fixed corporate costs previously allocated to the expiring programs or discontinued contract work. Our USPS managed inventory program (\u201cMIP\u201d) and our foreign military sales program with the U.S. Navy (\u201cFMS Program\u201d) each constitute a material portion of our revenues. This concentration of our revenue subjects us to risk of material adverse revenue disruptions if customer operational decisions, government contractual or other issues prevent or delay the fulfillment of work requirements associated with these key programs. In recent years, revenue levels for our FMS Program have fluctuated widely enough to cause material changes in our overall revenue levels and affect our profit margins. Similarly, variations in volume and types of parts purchased by the USPS in recent years have caused changes in our profit margins.\nThe USPS has initiated a fleet replacement program for a next generation of the delivery vehicle fleet. The timing of both the roll out of a new fleet and the retirement of the current vehicles and their decision on how many of such vehicles will remain in the fleet could potentially have a significant affect on our future revenues and profits.\nGlobal economic conditions and political factors could adversely affect our revenues.\nRevenues from our government programs for which work is performed in foreign countries are subject to economic conditions in these countries and to political risks posed by ongoing foreign conflicts and potential terrorist activity. Services performed by our employees on our FMS Program are, to a certain extent, dependent on our placement of employees in a client country. Significant domestic and political unrest in client countries can constrain our ability to maintain consistent staffing levels, resulting in a fluctuating level of services performed by our employees. We cannot predict when these conditions will occur or the effect it will have on our FMS Program revenues. Regime changes in these countries can result in government restrictions upon the continuation of ongoing work.\nEconomic conditions in both the United States and foreign countries, and global prices and availability of oil and other commodities could potentially have an adverse effect on the demand for some of our services, including our aviation services.\nDue to the nature of our work we could potentially be exposed to legal actions arising from our operations.\nOur work includes many manual tasks, including warehousing, shipping and packing of truck parts inventory, maintaining and repairing military and non-military vehicles, aircraft and equipment, and maintaining and overhauling U.S. Navy ships. Some of our work efforts involve the handling of hazardous materials. These services may pose certain challenges that could cause us to be exposed to legal and other liabilities arising from performance issues, work related incidents or employee misconduct that result in damages, injury or death to third parties. Such events could cause us to suffer financial losses and adversely affect our financial condition. (See Item 3. \"Legal Proceedings\u201d below.)\nTechnology security and cyber-attack risks could potentially impact our financial results.\nWe face the threat to our computer systems of unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, malicious code, organized cyber-attacks and other security problems and system disruptions, including possible unauthorized access to our and our clients' proprietary or classified information.\nSome of our contract work includes data management and technology services associated with Social Security Administration and military medical and health records. This exposes us to certain information and technology security risks. If there is a security breach of sensitive data in our custody or for which we provide services, we could possibly be held liable for damages to third parties related to such security breach and incur costs to prevent future incidents. We also provide refurbishment, maintenance and training services support to international clients directly and through DoD. Foreign nations with interests that conflict with the international clients we support could be motivated to conduct a cyber-attack to access information on these programs.\nWe maintain a cybersecurity risk management program to monitor and mitigate cybersecurity threats and an incident response plan for emerging threats. Costs associated with preventing or remediating information management security breaches or complying with related laws and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Additionally, we have obtained insurance that provides coverage for certain cybersecurity incidents. However, the occurrence of a future security breach event could potentially have such an adverse effect.\nAcquisitions, which have been a part of our business strategy in recent years, present certain risks.\nThe acquisition of a business that subsequently does not meet expected operating and financial performance targets, the ineffective integration of an acquisition, our inability to service debt associated with an acquisition, or the failure to timely complete an acquisition could adversely affect our financial performance or condition.\nThe nature of our operations and work performed by our employees present certain challenges related to work force management.\nOur financial performance is heavily dependent on the abilities of our operating and administrative staff with respect to technical skills, operating performance, pricing, cost management, safety, and administrative and compliance efforts. A wide diversity of contract types, nature of work, work locations, and legal and regulatory complexities challenges our administrative staff and skill sets. We also face challenges associated with our quality of workforce, quality of work, safety, and labor relations compliance. Our current and projected work in foreign countries exposes us to challenges associated with export and ethics compliance, local laws and customs, workforce issues, extended supply chain, political unrest and war zone threats. Failure to attract or retain an adequately skilled workforce, lack of knowledge or training in critical functions, or inadequate staffing levels can result in lost work, reduced profit margins, losses from cost overruns, performance deficiencies, workplace accidents, and regulatory noncompliance.\nOur business could be adversely affected by incidents that could cause an interruption in our operations or impose a significant financial liability on us.\nDisruption of our operations due to internal or external system or service failures, accidents or incidents involving employees or third parties working in high-risk locations, or natural disasters or other crises could adversely affect our financial performance and condition. A fire, flood, earthquake, or other natural disaster at physical facilities that support key revenue generating operations, or a procurement system or contractual delay could potentially interrupt the revenues from our operations.\nWe are subject to numerous government rules and regulations that could expose us to potential liabilities or work loss.\nWe must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of government contracts. A violation of laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of contracts or debarment from working or bidding on government contracts.\nIn some instances, these government contract laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are significantly more favorable to the government than those typically available to commercial parties in negotiated transactions. For example, the government may terminate any government contract or subcontract at its convenience, as well as for performance default.\nA termination for default could expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. A termination for default could also impact our past performance and ability to obtain new or additional work. In addition, the government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor, irrespective of the quality of services provided by us as a subcontractor.\nAdditionally, our contract work that is performed by our subcontractors is subject to government compliance, performance requirements and financial risks. If any of our subcontractors fail to timely meet their contractual obligations or have regulatory compliance or other problems, our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor may be jeopardized.\nThe aviation industry is highly regulated by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (\"FAA\") and similar regulatory agencies in other countries. Aviation engines and engine components that we sell must meet certain airworthiness standards established by the FAA or the equivalent agencies in certain other countries. We also operate repair facilities that are licensed by the FAA and equivalent agencies of certain other countries to perform such services. New and more stringent regulations may be adopted in the future that could have an adverse effect on us.\nOur business could be adversely affected by government audits or investigations.\nGovernment agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Contract Management Agency and the Department of Labor, routinely audit and investigate government contractors. These agencies review a contractor\u2019s performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. The government also may review the adequacy of, and a contractor\u2019s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor\u2019s purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed and any such costs already reimbursed must be refunded.\nThe scope and rigor of government agency audits and investigations have increased in recent years, resulting in a greater likelihood that an audit or investigation may result in an adverse outcome. We have been subject to unfavorable findings and recommendations from various government agencies from time to time. We expect that government agencies will continue to rigorously audit and investigate us and there may be adverse or disputed findings, resulting in corrective action plans and/or settlements.\nIf an audit or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the government. In addition, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety were made. Performance of international work can expose us to risks associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Export Control Act compliance.\nInvestments in facilities could cause losses if certain work is disrupted or discontinued.\nWe have made investments in facilities and lease commitments to support specific business programs, work requirements, and service offerings. A slowing or disruption of these business programs, work requirements, or service offerings that results in operating below intended levels could cause us to suffer financial losses.\nEnvironmental and pollution risks could potentially impact our financial results.\nSome of our contract work includes the use of chemical solvents and the handling of hazardous materials to maintain, repair, and refurbish vehicles, aircraft engines, and equipment. This exposes us to certain environmental and pollution risks. Costs associated with compliance with Federal, State and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials or that otherwise relate to the protection of the environment have not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive\nposition. However, we cannot predict the likelihood of such a material adverse effect should we experience the occurrence of a future environmental or pollution event.", "PERMNO": 79864, "SIC": 8711, "TIC": "VSEC"}
