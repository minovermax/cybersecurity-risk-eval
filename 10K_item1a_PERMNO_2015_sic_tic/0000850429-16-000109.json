{"cik": "850429", "company": "TREDEGAR CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThere are a number of risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. The following risk factors should be considered, in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (\u201cForm 10-K\u201d), when evaluating Tredegar and its businesses:\nGeneral\n\u2022\nTredegar has an underfunded defined benefit (pension) plan. Tredegar sponsors a pension plan that covers certain hourly and salaried employees in the U.S. The plan was substantially frozen to new participants in 2007, and frozen to benefit accruals for active participants in 2014. As of December 31, 2015, the plan was underfunded under U.S. GAAP measures by $93.2 million. Tredegar expects that it will be required to make a cash contribution of approximately $6.1 million to its underfunded pension plan in 2016, and may be required to make higher cash contributions in future periods depending on the level of interest rates and investment returns on plan assets.\n\u2022\nU.S. and global economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of some or all of Tredegar\u2019s operations. As a global entity, the consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for Tredegar could become more sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions, including fluctuations in exchange rates. Sales associated with new products and regions tend to more closely follow the cycles within the economy. Cost reductions and productivity improvements may not be sufficient to offset the adverse effects on profitability from lower customer demand in an economic downturn. Therefore, as such product offerings become a greater part of the Company\u2019s business, its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by seasonal slowdowns, cyclical downturns in the economy or changes in foreign currency rates.\n\u2022\nNoncompliance with any of the covenants in the Company\u2019s $350 million credit facility could result in all debt under the agreement outstanding at such time becoming due and limiting its borrowing capacity, which could have a material adverse effect on consolidated financial condition and liquidity. The credit agreement governing Tredegar\u2019s revolving credit facility contains restrictions and financial covenants that could restrict the Company\u2019s operational and financial flexibility. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, would result in all outstanding debt under the credit facility at such time becoming due, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial condition and liquidity. Renegotiation of the covenant(s) through an amendment to the revolving credit facility may effectively cure the noncompliance, but may have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial condition or liquidity depending upon how the amended covenant is renegotiated.\n\u2022\nTredegar\u2019s performance is influenced by costs incurred by its operating companies, including, for example, the cost of raw materials and energy. These costs include, without limitation, the cost of resin (the raw material on which PE Films primarily depends), PTA and MEG (the raw materials on which Flexible Packaging Films primarily depends), aluminum (the raw material on which Aluminum Extrusions primarily depends), natural gas (the principal fuel necessary for Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 plants to operate), electricity and diesel fuel. Resin, aluminum and natural gas prices are extremely volatile as shown in the charts in the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures section on pages 36-37. The Company attempts to mitigate the effects of increased costs through price increases and contractual pass-through provisions, but there are no assurances that higher prices can effectively be passed through to customers or that Tredegar will be able to offset fully or on a timely basis the effects of higher raw material and energy costs through price increases or pass-through arrangements. Further, the Company\u2019s cost control efforts may not be sufficient to offset any additional future declines in revenue or increases in raw material, energy or other costs.\n\u2022\nSubstantial international operations subject the Company to risks of doing business in countries outside the U.S., which could adversely affect its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Risks inherent in international operations include the following, by way of example: changes in general economic conditions or governmental policies, potential difficulty enforcing agreements and intellectual property rights, modifications in foreign tax laws and incentives, staffing and managing widespread operations and the challenges of complying with a wide variety of laws and regulations, restrictions on international trade or investment, restrictions on the repatriation of income, imposition of additional taxes on income generated outside the U.S., nationalization of private enterprises, unexpected adverse changes in international laws and regulatory requirements and fluctuations in exchange rates. In the countries where Tredegar conducts its operations, significant fluctuations in the foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a material impact on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, while expanding operations into emerging markets provides greater opportunities for growth, there are certain operating risks, as previously noted.\n\u2022\nTredegar may not be able to successfully identify, complete or integrate strategic acquisitions. From time to time, the Company evaluates acquisition candidates that fit its business objectives. Acquisitions involve special risks, including, without limitation, meeting revenue, margin, working capital and capital expenditure expectations that substantially drive valuation, diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from existing businesses, the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies and potential difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving anticipated operational improvements. Acquired businesses may not achieve expected results.\n\u2022\nFailure to continue to attract, develop and retain certain senior executive officers, operating company management or other key employees could adversely affect Tredegar\u2019s businesses. The Company depends on its senior executive officers, operating company management and other key personnel to run the businesses. The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on operations. Competition for qualified employees among companies that rely heavily on engineering and technology expertise is intense, and the loss of qualified employees or an inability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled employees required for the operation and expansion of Tredegar\u2019s businesses could hinder its ability to improve manufacturing operations, conduct research activities successfully and develop marketable products.\n\u2022\nTredegar is subject to various environmental laws and regulations and could become exposed to material liabilities and costs associated with such laws. The Company is subject to various environmental obligations and could become subject to additional obligations in the future. In the case of known potential liabilities, it is management\u2019s judgment that the resolution of ongoing and/or pending environmental remediation obligations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial condition or liquidity. In any given period(s), however, it is possible such obligations or matters could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations. Changes in environmental laws and regulations, or their application, including, but not limited to, those relating to global climate change, could subject Tredegar to significant additional capital expenditures and operating expenses. Moreover, future developments in federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations are difficult to predict. Environmental laws have become and are expected to continue to become increasingly strict. As a result, Tredegar expects to be subject to new environmental laws and regulations. However, any such changes are uncertain and, therefore, it is not possible for the Company to predict with certainty the amount of additional capital expenditures or operating expenses that could be necessary for compliance with respect to any such changes. See Government Regulation on page 4 for a further discussion of this risk factor.\n\u2022\nMaterial disruptions at one of the Company\u2019s major manufacturing facilities could negatively impact financial results. Tredegar believes its facilities are operated in compliance with applicable local laws and regulations and that the Company has implemented measures to minimize the risks of disruption at its facilities. Such a disruption could be a result of any number of events, including but not limited to: an equipment failure with repairs requiring long lead times, labor stoppages or shortages, utility disruptions, constraints on the supply or delivery of critical raw materials, and severe weather conditions. A material disruption in one of the Company\u2019s operating locations could negatively impact production and its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022\nAn information technology system failure may adversely affect the business. Tredegar relies on information technology systems to help manage business processes, collect and interpret business data and communicate internally and externally with employees, investors, suppliers, customers and others. Some of these information systems are managed by third-party service providers. The Company has backup systems and business continuity plans in place, and takes care to protect its systems and data from unauthorized access. To date, interruptions of our information systems have been infrequent and have not had a material impact on our operations. Nevertheless, an information technology system failure due to computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, power interruptions, hardware failures, fire, natural disasters, human error, or other causes could disrupt operations and prevent the Company from being able to process transactions with its customers, operate its manufacturing facilities, and properly report those transactions in a timely manner. A significant, protracted information technology system failure or cyber attacks or security breaches by parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes may result in the loss of revenue, assets or personal or other sensitive data, cause damage to the reputation of the Company and result in legal challenges and significant remediation and other costs to the Company.\n\u2022\nTredegar is subject to credit risk that is inherent with efforts to increase market share as the Company attempts to broaden its customer base. In the event of the deterioration of operating cash flows or diminished borrowing capacity of Tredegar\u2019s customers, the collection of trade receivable balances may be delayed or deemed unlikely. The Company\u2019s credit risk exposure could increase as business is expanded, including on export sales which have payment terms in excess of domestic sales. In addition, the operations of the customers for Aluminum Extrusions generally follow the cycles within the economy, resulting in greater credit risk from diminished operating cash flows and higher bankruptcy rates when the economy is deteriorating or in recession.\n\u2022\nAn inability to renegotiate the Company\u2019s collective bargaining agreements could adversely impact its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Some of the Company\u2019s employees are represented by labor unions under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. Tredegar may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements when they expire, which could result in strikes or work stoppages or higher labor costs. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at the Company\u2019s facilities in the future. Any such work stoppages (or potential work stoppages) could negatively impact Tredegar\u2019s ability to manufacture its products and adversely affect its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022\nTredegar\u2019s valuation of its $7.5 million cost-basis investment in kal\u00e9o is volatile and uncertain. Tredegar uses the fair value method to account for its 19% ownership interest and investment in kaleo, Inc. (\u201ckal\u00e9o\u201d), a private specialty pharmaceutical company. There is no active secondary market for buying or selling ownership interests in kal\u00e9o. The Company\u2019s fair value estimates can fluctuate materially between reporting periods, primarily due to variances in performance versus expectations, and kal\u00e9o\u2019s ability to meet developmental and commercialization milestones within an anticipated time frame. Commercial sales of kal\u00e9o\u2019s first licensed product, an epinephrine auto-injector, commenced in the first quarter of 2013, and commercial sales of its second product, a naloxone auto-injector, commenced in the third quarter of 2014.\nIn 2009, kal\u00e9o licensed exclusive rights to sanofi-aventis U.S. LLC (\u201cSanofi\u201d) to commercialize the epinephrine auto-injector in the U.S. and Canada. Sanofi began manufacturing and distributing the epinephrine auto-injector, under the names Auvi-Q\u00ae in the U.S. and Allerject\u00ae in Canada, in 2013. Sanofi announced on October 28, 2015, a voluntary recall of all Auvi-Q and Allerject epinephrine auto-injectors that were previously on the market. As a result of this recall and its adverse impact on kal\u00e9o\u2019s expected future prospects, the Company\u2019s estimated fair value of its investment decreased $20.5 million, or 52%, in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nKal\u00e9o may need additional financing as it addresses this recall, attempts to correct the issues with its epinephrine auto-injector that resulted in the recall, and continues to invest in its product pipeline. Whether or not kal\u00e9o could be successful in raising additional funds is uncertain. Moreover, significant dilution could occur to existing investors in any new round of financing that does occur. Even with additional financing, kal\u00e9o may not be able to resolve the recall issue or bring new technology to market.\nThe estimated fair value of the Company\u2019s investment in kal\u00e9o was $18.6 million at December 31, 2015 (included in \u201cOther assets and deferred charges\u201d in the consolidated balance sheets).\nPE Films\n\u2022\nPE Films is highly dependent on sales associated with its top five customers, the largest of which is P&G. PE Films\u2019 top five customers comprised approximately 32%, 38% and 44% of Tredegar\u2019s consolidated net sales (sales less freight) from continuing operations, in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, with net sales to P&G alone comprising approximately 19%, 24% and 28% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The loss or significant reduction of sales associated with one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. Other factors that could adversely affect the business include, by way of example, (i) failure by a key customer to achieve success or maintain share in markets in which they sell products containing PE Films\u2019 materials, (ii) key customers rolling out products utilizing technologies developed by others that replace PE Films\u2019 business with such customer, (iii) delays in a key customer rolling out products utilizing new technologies developed by PE Films and (iv) operational decisions by a key customer that result in component substitution, inventory reductions and similar changes. While PE Films has undertaken efforts to expand its customer base, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful, or that they will offset any delay or loss of sales and profits associated with these large customers.\nIn recent years, PE Films lost substantial sales volume due to product transitions and suffered other losses associated with various customers (see further discussion in the Executive Summary, PE Films section on page 20).\nPE Films anticipates further exposure to product transitions and lost business in certain personal care materials that could negatively affect future operating profit from ongoing operations by approximately $10 million annually, likely beginning after 2017. While it continues to identify new business opportunities with its existing customers, PE Films is also working to expand its customer base in order to create long-term growth and profitability by actively competing for new business with various customers across its full product portfolio and introducing new products and/or improvements to existing applications. There is no assurance that these efforts to expand the revenue base and mitigate this or any future loss of sales and profits from significant customers will be successful.\n\u2022\nPE Films and its customers operate in highly competitive markets. PE Films competes on product innovation, quality, price and service, and its businesses and their customers operate in highly competitive markets. Global market conditions continue to exacerbate the Company\u2019s exposure to margin compression due to competitive forces, especially as certain products move into the later stages of their product life cycles. While PE Films continually works to identify new business opportunities with existing and new customers, primarily through the development of new products with improved performance and/or cost characteristics, there can be no assurances that such efforts will be successful, or that they will offset business lost from competitive dynamics or customer product transitions.\n\u2022\nGrowth of PE Films depends on its ability to develop and deliver new products at competitive prices. Personal care materials, surface protection films and engineered polymer solutions applications are now being made with a variety of new innovative materials and the overall cycle for bringing new films products to market has accelerated. While PE Films has substantial technological resources, there can be no assurance that its new products can be brought to market successfully, or if brought to market successfully, at the same level of profitability and market share of replaced films. A shift in customer preferences away from PE Films\u2019 technologies, its inability to develop and deliver new profitable products, or delayed acceptance of its new products in domestic or foreign markets, could have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In the long term, growth will depend on PE Films\u2019 ability to provide innovative products at a price that meets the customers\u2019 needs.\n\u2022\nFailure of PE Films\u2019 customers, who are subject to cyclical downturns, to achieve success or maintain market share could adversely impact its sales and operating margins. PE Films\u2019 plastic films serve as components for various consumer products sold worldwide. A customer\u2019s ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market their products is integral to PE Films\u2019 success. In addition, many customers are in industries that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions. During weak economic cycles, consumers of premium products made with or using PE Films\u2019 components may shift to less premium, less expensive products, reducing the demand for PE Films\u2019 plastic films. Cycle downturns may negatively affect businesses that use PE Films\u2019 plastic film products, which could adversely affect sales and operating margins.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s inability to protect its intellectual property rights or its infringement of the intellectual property rights of others could have a material adverse impact on PE Films. PE Films operates in an industry where its significant customers and competitors have substantial intellectual property portfolios. The continued success of its business depends on its ability not only to protect its own technologies and trade secrets, but also to develop and sell new products that do not infringe upon existing patents or threaten existing customer relationships. Intellectual property litigation is very costly and could result in substantial expense and diversions of Company resources, both of which could adversely affect its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, there may be no effective legal recourse against infringement of the Company\u2019s intellectual property by third parties, whether due to limitations on enforcement of rights in foreign jurisdictions or as a result of other factors. An unfavorable outcome in any intellectual property litigation or similar proceeding could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of PE Films.\n\u2022\nAn unstable economic environment could have a disruptive impact on PE Films\u2019 supply chain. Certain raw materials used in manufacturing PE Films\u2019 products are sourced from single suppliers, and PE Films may not be able to quickly or inexpensively re-source from other suppliers. The risk of damage or disruption to its supply chain may increase if and when different suppliers consolidate their product portfolios or experience financial distress. Failure to take adequate steps to effectively manage such events, which are intensified when a product is procured from a single supplier or location, could adversely affect PE Films\u2019 consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as require additional resources to restore its supply chain.\nFlexible Packaging Films\n\u2022\nUncertain economic conditions in Brazil could adversely impact the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Flexible Packaging Films. Flexible Packaging Films and its customers operate in a highly competitive global market for PET films. In addition, its operations have been adversely impacted by ongoing unfavorable economic conditions in Brazil, its primary market, which accounted for approximately 46% of its overall sales in 2015. These combined factors have resulted in significant competitive pricing pressures and margin compression. Tredegar has attempted to mitigate these impacts through new product offerings, cost saving measures and manufacturing efficiency initiatives, but these efforts to-date have not been sufficient, resulting in a significant decline in the operating profit for Flexible Packaging Films since its acquisition in October 2011 and further efforts may not be successful, which could adversely impact Flexible Packaging Films\u2019 financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022\nGovernmental failure to extend anti-dumping duties in Brazil on imported products or prevent competitors from circumventing such duties could adversely impact Flexible Packaging Films. In recent years, excess global capacity in the industry has led to increased competitive pressures from imports into Brazil, the Company\u2019s primary market for flexible packaging films. The Company believes that these conditions have shifted the competitive environment from a regional to a global landscape and have driven price convergence and lower product margins for Flexible Packaging Films. In addition to previous actions taken against UAE, Mexico and Turkey, the Brazilian government recently extended anti-dumping duties on PET films imported from China, Egypt and India, and authorities have initiated new investigations of dumping against Peru and Bahrain. Competitors not currently subject to anti-dumping duties may choose to utilize their excess capacity by selling product in Brazil, which may result in pricing pressures thereby creating margin compression that Flexible Packaging Films may not be able to offset with cost savings measures and/or manufacturing efficiency initiatives.\nAluminum Extrusions\n\u2022\nSales volume and profitability of Aluminum Extrusions is seasonal and cyclical and highly dependent on economic conditions of end-use markets in the U.S., particularly in the construction sector. Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 end-use markets can be subject to seasonality as well as large cyclical swings in volume. Because of capital intensive nature and level of fixed costs inherent in the aluminum extrusions business, the percentage drop in operating profits in a cyclical downturn will likely exceed the percentage drop in volume. Any benefits associated with cost reductions and productivity improvements may not be sufficient to offset the adverse effects on profitability from pricing and margin pressure and higher bad debts (including a greater chance of loss associated with customers defaulting on fixed-price forward sales contracts) that usually accompany a downturn. In addition, higher energy costs can further reduce profits unless offset by price increases or cost reductions and productivity improvements.\n\u2022\nThe markets for Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 products are highly competitive with product quality, service, delivery performance and price being the principal competitive factors. Aluminum Extrusions has approximately 1,500 customers that are in a variety of end-use markets within the broad categories of building and construction, distribution, automotive and other transportation, machinery and equipment, electrical and consumer durables. No single customer exceeds 3% of Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 net sales. Future success and prospects depend on its ability to provide superior service and high quality products to retain existing customers and participate in overall industry cross-cycle growth. In recent years, increased demand, primarily from the nonresidential building and construction sector, has pushed Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 average capacity utilization in excess of 90%. Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 ability to grow and service existing customers is closely tied to having sufficient capacity.\nDuring improving economic conditions, excess industry capacity is absorbed and pricing pressure becomes less of a factor in many of its end-use markets. Conversely, during an economic slowdown, excess industry capacity often drives increased pricing pressure in many end-use markets as competitors protect their position with key customers. Because the business is susceptible to these changing economic conditions, Aluminum Extrusions targets complex, customized, service-intensive business with more challenging requirements in order to differentiate itself from competitors that focus on higher volume, standard extrusion applications.\n\u2022\nAluminum Extrusions\u2019 efforts to expand the Company\u2019s presence in the automotive market may not be successful. Aluminum Extrusions has made significant capital investments in recent years to increase sales to automotive and light truck tier suppliers. Efforts to expand product offerings and broaden the customer base are tied to successfully substituting the Company\u2019s aluminum extrusions for current market alternatives. New Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards requiring material improvements in the automotive and light truck MPG (miles per gallon) by 2025, are expected to increase demand for lighter materials used in the vehicle\u2019s body, some of which can be supplied by Aluminum Extrusions. If the demand does not increase and/or the alternative products offered by Aluminum Extrusions are not accepted by its customers, Aluminum Extrusions may not generate expected returns on its capital investments, which could have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022\nFailure to extend duties on imported products or prevent competitors from circumventing such duties could adversely impact Aluminum Extrusions. In previous years, imports into the U.S., primarily from China, represented an increasing portion of the U.S. aluminum extrusion market. However, due to an affirmative determination by the U.S. International Trade Commission in April 2011 that asserted that dumped and subsidized imports of aluminum extrusion from China unfairly and negatively impacted the domestic industry, the U.S. Department of Commerce has applied duties to these imported products. As a result, aluminum extrusion imports from China have decreased significantly. While the risk to the domestic industry has been abated for the time being, these protective duties are scheduled to expire in 2016. There are ongoing efforts within the U.S. aluminum extrusions industry to extend these protective duties. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Aluminum Extrusions.", "PERMNO": 75649, "SIC": 3081, "TIC": "TG"}
