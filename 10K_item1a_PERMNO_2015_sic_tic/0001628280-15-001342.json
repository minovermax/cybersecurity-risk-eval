You should carefully consider, in addition to the other information set forth herein, the following risk factors.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by current conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.\nThe U.S. economic recession in 2007 through 2009, and the sluggish economic recovery since then, has had an adverse effect on our business. In addition, the global financial markets have undergone and may continue to experience pervasive and fundamental disruptions, which also have an adverse effect on our business. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers' underlying financial strength. While economic conditions have shown signs of improvement, the sustainability of an economic recovery is uncertain as economic activity continues to face difficulties due to cautious business spending, the variable rate of U.S. economic growth, weak commodity prices, low wage growth offsetting the improved levels of unemployment, currency exchange rate volatility and its effect on export growth, and the slowing and negative economic growth and other continuing economic developments in Europe and Asia.\nA sustained weakness or further weakening in business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we do business could have one or more of the following adverse effects on our business:\n\u2022\na decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us;\n\u2022\na decrease in deposit balances due to overall reductions in the accounts of customers;\n\u2022\na decrease in the value of our loans or other assets secured by real estate;\n\u2022\na decrease in net interest income derived from our lending and deposit gathering activities;\n\u2022\nan impairment of certain intangible assets; or\n\u2022\nan increase in the number of borrowers who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us. An increase in the number delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and provisions for credit losses.\nUnfavorable changes in economic conditions generally have an adverse effect on our business, and there can be no assurance that the economic recovery will be sustainable in the near term. If economic conditions worsen or remain volatile, we expect our business, financial condition and results of operations to be adversely affected.\nOur concentration of loans to privately owned small and medium-sized companies and to a limited number of clients within a particular industry or region could expose us to greater lending risk if the market sector, industry or region were to experience economic difficulties or changes in the regulatory environment.\nOur portfolio consists primarily of commercial loans to small and medium-sized, privately owned businesses in a limited number of industries and regions primarily throughout the United States.\nAs of December 31, 2014, real estate mortgage loans (which are predominately commercial real estate loans) comprised 47.1% of our total portfolio. At December 31, 2014, our largest property type concentration was healthcare property, totaling 18.4% of real estate mortgage loans. Other significant real estate mortgage loan property type concentrations were office properties at 13.9% and multi-family properties at 13.8% at December 31, 2014. In addition, 52.7% of our loans secured by real estate were in California at December 31, 2014.\nCommercial loans and leases comprised 49.4% of our total portfolio at December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2014, our largest commercial loan type concentration was cash flow loans, totaling 20.9% of our total portfolio. Cash flow secured loans are provided to sophisticated buyers and private equity groups, financial investors, strategic companies and sponsors to finance the acquisition or recapitalization of a business. Other significant commercial concentrations were asset-based loans at 15.1% and equipment finance at 8.2% of the total portfolio at December 31, 2014.\nIf any particular industry or geographic region were to experience economic difficulties, the overall timing and amount of collections on our loans to clients operating in those industries or geographic regions may differ from what we expected, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nAdditionally, compared to larger, publicly owned firms, privately owned small and medium-sized companies generally have limited access to capital and higher funding costs, may be in a weaker financial position and therefore more susceptible to economic downturns or volatility and may need more capital to expand or compete. These financial challenges may make it difficult for our clients to make scheduled payments of interest or principal on our loans. Accordingly, loans made to these types of clients entail higher risks than loans made to companies that are able to access a broader array of credit sources. The concentration of our portfolio in loans to these types of clients could amplify these risks.\nFurther, there is generally no publicly available information about the small and medium-sized privately owned companies to which we lend. Therefore, we underwrite our loans based on detailed financial information and projections provided to us by our clients and we must rely on our clients and the due diligence efforts of our employees to obtain the information relevant to making our credit decisions. We rely upon the management of these companies to provide full and accurate disclosure of material information concerning their business, financial condition and prospects. We may not have access to all of the material information about a particular client's business, financial condition and prospects, or a client's accounting records may be poorly maintained or organized. The client's business, financial condition and prospects may also change rapidly in the current economic environment. In such instances, we may not make a fully informed credit decision which may lead, ultimately, to a failure or inability to recover our loan in its entirety.\nOur business is subject to interest rate risk, and variations in interest rates may materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nChanges in the interest rate environment may reduce our profits. It is expected that we will continue to realize income from the differential or \"spread\" between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets, and interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest spreads are affected by the difference between the maturities and repricing characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in market interest rates generally affect loan volume, loan yields, funding sources and funding costs. Our net interest spread depends on many factors that are partly or completely out of our control, including competition, federal economic monetary and fiscal policies, and general economic conditions.\nWhile an increase in the general level of interest rates may increase our loan yield, it may adversely affect the ability of certain borrowers with variable-rate loans to pay the interest on and principal of their obligations. In addition, an increase in market interest rates on loans is generally associated with a lower volume of loan originations, which may reduce earnings. Following an increase in the general level of interest rates, our ability to maintain a positive net interest spread is dependent on our ability to increase our loan offering rates, replace loan maturities with new originations, minimize increases on our deposit rates, and maintain an acceptable level and mix of funding. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to increase our loan offering rates and continue to originate loans due to the competitive landscape in which we operate. Additionally, we cannot provide assurances that we can minimize the increases in our deposit rates while maintaining an acceptable level of deposits. Finally, we cannot provide any assurances that we can maintain our current levels of noninterest-bearing deposits as customers may seek higher yielding products when rates increase.\nFollowing a decline in the general level of interest rates, our ability to maintain a positive net interest spread is dependent on our ability to reduce the interest paid on deposits, borrowings, and other interest-bearing liabilities. We cannot provide assurance that we would be able to lower the rates paid on deposit accounts to support our liquidity requirements as lower rates may result in deposit outflows.\nAccordingly, changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest spread, asset quality, loan origination volume, liquidity, and overall profitability. We cannot assure you that we can minimize our interest rate risk.\nLiquidity risk would impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to acquire deposits or borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole as a result of conditions faced by banking organizations in the domestic and worldwide credit markets.\nWe face strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking services, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe conduct our community banking operations primarily in Southern California. Increased competition in our market may result in reduced loans and deposits or less favorable loan and deposit terms. Ultimately, we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. Many competitors offer the same banking services that we offer in our service areas. These competitors include national banks, regional banks and other community banks. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including without limitation, savings and loan institutions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit unions, mortgage banks and other financial intermediaries. In particular, our competitors include several major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and ATMs and conduct extensive promotional and advertising campaigns.\nAdditionally, banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions have larger or no lending limits and are thereby able to serve the credit needs of larger customers. Areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits, efforts to obtain deposits, and the range and quality of products and services provided, including new technology driven products and services. Technological innovation continues to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets as technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services. We also face competition from out-of-state financial intermediaries that have opened production offices or that solicit deposits in our market areas. Should competition in the financial services industry intensify, our ability to market our products and services may be adversely affected. If we are unable to attract and retain banking customers, we may be unable to grow or maintain the levels of our loans and deposits and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected as a result.\nCompetition from financial institutions seeking to maintain adequate liquidity places upward pressure on the rates paid on certain deposit accounts relative to the level of market interest rates during times of both decreasing and increasing market liquidity. To maintain both attractive and adequate levels of liquidity, without exhausting secondary sources of liquidity, we may incur increased deposit costs.\nSeveral rating agencies publish unsolicited ratings of the financial performance and relative financial health of many banks, including Pacific Western, based on publicly available data. As these ratings are publicly available, a decline in the Bank's ratings from these agencies may result in deposit outflows or the inability of the Bank to raise deposits in the secondary market as broker-dealers and depositors may use such ratings in deciding where to deposit their funds.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in the actual or perceived soundness or condition of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions that deal with each other are interconnected as a result of trading, investment, liquidity management, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. Within the financial services industry, loss of public confidence, including through default by any one institution, could lead to liquidity challenges or to defaults by other institutions. Concerns about, or a default by, one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems and losses or defaults by other institutions, as the commercial and financial soundness of many financial institutions is closely related as a result of these credit, trading, clearing and other relationships. Even the perceived lack of creditworthiness of, or questions about, a counterparty may lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by various institutions. This systemic risk may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, banks and exchanges with which we interact on a daily basis or key funding providers such as the Federal Home Loan Banks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not recover all amounts that are contractually owed to us by our borrowers.\nThe Company is dependent primarily on loan and lease principal, interest, and fee collections to fund its operations. A shortfall in collections and proceeds may impair our ability to fund our operations or to repay our existing debt.\nWhen we loan money, commit to loan money or enter into a letter of credit or other contract with a counterparty, we incur credit risk. The credit quality of our portfolio can have a significant impact on our earnings. We expect to experience charge-offs and delinquencies on our loans in the future. Our clients' actual operating results may be worse than our underwriting indicated when we originated the loans, and in this circumstance, if timely corrective action is not taken, we could incur a substantial impairment or loss of the value on such loans. We may fail to identify problems because our client did not report them in a timely manner or, even if the client did report the problem, we may fail to address it quickly enough or at all. Even if clients provide us with full and accurate disclosure of all material information concerning their businesses, we may misinterpret or incorrectly analyze this information. Mistakes may cause us to make loans that we otherwise would not have made, to fund advances that we otherwise would not have funded, result in losses on one or more of our loans, or necessitate that we significantly increase our allowance for loans losses. As a result, we could suffer loan losses and have nonperforming loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, net income and results of operations and financial condition, to the extent the losses exceed our allowance for loan and lease losses.\nThe collateral securing a loan or lease may not be sufficient to protect us if we have not properly obtained or perfected a lien on such collateral or if the collateral value does not cover the loan or lease.\nMost of our loans are secured by a lien on specified collateral of the client and we may not obtain or properly perfect our liens or the value of the collateral securing any particular loan may not protect us from suffering a partial or complete loss if the loan becomes non-performing and we move to foreclose on the collateral. In such event, we could suffer loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, net income, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn particular, cash flow lending involves lending money to a client based primarily on the expected cash flow, profitability and enterprise value of a client rather than on the value of its assets. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 20.9% of our portfolio was comprised of cash flow loans. Although the value of the enterprise is significantly in excess of our loan balance, the value of the stand-alone assets which we hold as collateral for these loans is typically substantially less than the amount of money we advance to a client under these loans. When a cash flow loan becomes non-performing, our primary recourse to recover some or all of the principal of our loan is to force the sale of the entire company as a going concern or restructure the company in a way we believe would enable it to generate sufficient cash flow over time to repay our loan. Neither of these alternatives may be an available or viable option or generate enough proceeds to repay the loan.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future and such capital may not be available when needed or at all.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments, regulatory requirements, and business needs. As a publicly traded company, a likely source of additional funds is the capital markets, accomplished generally through the issuance of equity, both common and preferred stock, and the issuance of subordinated debentures. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and our financial performance. Deterioration in economic conditions and the loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase our cost of funding and limit our access to some of our customary sources of liquidity, including, but not limited to, the capital markets, inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings from the discount window of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (\"FRBSF\").\nWe cannot assure you that access to such capital and liquidity will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers, or depositors of the Bank or counterparties participating in the capital markets, may materially and adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity. Further, if we need to raise capital in the future, we may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would then have to compete with those institutions for investors. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe value of our securities in our investment portfolio may decline in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we owned $1.6 billion of investment securities. The fair value of our investment securities may be adversely affected by market conditions, including changes in interest rates, and the occurrence of any events adversely affecting the issuer of particular securities in our investments portfolio. We analyze our securities on a quarterly basis to determine if an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred. The process for determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary usually requires complex, subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers, we may be required to recognize other-than-temporary impairment in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe banking industry is extensively regulated and supervised under both federal and state laws and regulations that are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, customers, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not for the protection of our stockholders and creditors. The Company is subject to regulation and supervision by the FRB, and the Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the FDIC, DBO and CFPB. The laws and regulations applicable to us govern a variety of matters, including permissible types, amounts and terms of loans and investments we make, the maximum interest rate that may be charged, consumer disclosures on the products and services we offer, the amount of reserves our bank must hold against deposits it takes, the types of deposits our bank may accept and the rates it may pay on such deposits, maintenance of adequate capital and liquidity, changes in control of us and the Bank, restrictions on dividends and establishment of new offices by the Bank. We must obtain approval from our regulators before engaging in certain activities, including certain acquisitions, and there can be no assurance that any regulatory approvals we may require will be obtained, or obtained without conditions, either in a timely manner or at all. Our regulators have the ability to compel us to, or restrict us from, taking certain actions entirely, such as actions that our regulators deem to constitute unsafe or unsound banking practice. Our failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, or regulatory policies and interpretations of such laws and regulations, could result in orders from our regulators, civil monetary penalties, or damage to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act significantly revised and expanded the rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority of federal bank regulators. Regulations affecting banks and other financial institutions, such as the Dodd-Frank Act, are undergoing continuous review and change frequently; the ultimate effect of such changes cannot be predicted. Because our business is highly regulated, compliance with such regulations and laws may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. Also, participation in any future specific government stabilization programs may subject us to additional restrictions. There can be no assurance that laws, rules and regulations will not be proposed or adopted in the future, which could (i) make compliance much more difficult or expensive, (ii) restrict our ability to originate, broker or sell loans or accept certain deposits, (iii) further limit or restrict the amount of commissions, interest or other charges earned on loans originated or sold by us, or (iv) otherwise materially and adversely affect our business or prospects for business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act has had and will continue to have material implications for the Company and the entire financial services industry. Among other things it has, had, or will or potentially could have the following effects:\n\u2022\ntogether with regulations implementing Basel reforms, affect the levels of capital and liquidity with which we must operate and how we plan capital and liquidity levels;\n\u2022\nsubject us to new and/or higher fees paid to various regulatory entities, including but not limited to deposit insurance fees to the FDIC;\n\u2022\nsubject us to annual stress tests;\n\u2022\nimpact our ability to invest in certain types of entities or engage in certain activities;\n\u2022\nrestrict the nature of our incentive compensation programs for executive officers;\n\u2022\nsubject us to the supervision of the CFPB, with its very broad rule-making and enforcement authorities; and\n\u2022\nsubject us to new and different litigation and regulatory enforcement risks.\nThe full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on us, our business strategies, and financial performance cannot be known at this time, and may not be known for a number of years, because this legislation requires many studies to be conducted and hundreds of regulations to be written in order for it to be fully implemented. However, these impacts are expected to be substantial and some of them may adversely affect us and our financial performance. The Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary or desired changes, and could therefore also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, on December 10, 2013, five financial regulatory agencies, including our primary federal regulator, the FRB, adopted the final rules implementing the Volcker Rule embodied in Section 13 of the Bank Holding Company Act, which was added by Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rules prohibit banking entities from, among other things, (i) engaging in short-term proprietary trading for their own accounts, and (ii) having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds. The final rules are intended to provide greater clarity with respect to both the extent of those primary prohibitions and of the related exemptions and exclusions. The final rules also require each regulated entity to establish an internal compliance program that is consistent with the extent to which it engages in activities covered by the Volcker Rule, which must include (for the largest entities) making regular reports about those activities to regulators. The final rules are effective April 1, 2014, but the conformance period has been extended from its statutory end date of July 21, 2014 until July 21, 2016. Because many of the effects of the Volcker Rule may become apparent only over the next several years as the federal financial regulatory agencies apply the rules in practice, the precise financial impact of the rule on the Company, its customers, or the financial industry more generally cannot currently be determined.\nWe are subject to capital adequacy standards, and a failure to meet these standards could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe Company and the Bank are each subject to capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and other regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital that must be maintained. From time to time, the regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines. If we fail to meet these minimum capital and liquidity guidelines and other regulatory requirements, we or our subsidiaries may be restricted in the types of activities we may conduct and may be prohibited from taking certain capital actions, such as paying dividends and repurchasing or redeeming capital securities.\nIn particular, the capital requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank under the recently adopted New Capital Rules are in the process of being phased-in. As a result of the New Capital Rules, we will be required to satisfy additional and more stringent capital adequacy and liquidity standards than we have in the past. Additionally, stress testing requirements may have the effect of requiring us to comply with the requirements of the New Capital Rules, or potentially even greater capital requirements, sooner than expected. While we expect to meet the requirements of the New Capital Rules, inclusive of the capital conservation buffer, as phased in by the FRB, these requirements could have a negative impact on our ability to lend, grow deposit balances, make acquisitions and make capital distributions in the form of dividends or share repurchases. Maintaining higher capital levels could also result in a lower return on equity, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreases in or required prepayments of FDIC insurance premiums may adversely affect our earnings.\nWe are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance and premiums may be increased or accelerated in the future. Since 2008, higher levels of bank failures dramatically increased resolution costs of the FDIC and depleted the deposit insurance fund. In addition, the FDIC instituted temporary programs, some of which were made permanent by the Dodd-Frank Act, to further insure customer deposits at FDIC-insured banks, which have placed additional stress on the deposit insurance fund.\nIn order to maintain a strong funding position and restore reserve ratios of the deposit insurance fund, the FDIC increased assessment rates of insured institutions. In addition, on November 12, 2009, the FDIC adopted a rule requiring banks to prepay three years' worth of premiums to replenish the depleted insurance fund.\nHistorically, the FDIC utilized a risk-based assessment system that imposed insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account several components including but not limited to the bank's capital level and supervisory ratings. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC amended its regulations to base insurance assessments on average consolidated assets less average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period.\nAny future increases in or required prepayments of FDIC insurance premiums may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ability to maintain, attract and retain customer relationships is highly dependent on our reputation.\nOur customers expect us to deliver superior, personalized financial services with the highest standards of ethics, performance, professionalism and compliance. Damage to our reputation could undermine the confidence of our current and potential customers in our ability to provide high-quality financial services. Such damage could also impair the confidence of our counterparties and vendors and ultimately affect our ability to effect transactions. Maintenance of our reputation depends not only on our success in maintaining our service-focused culture and controlling and mitigating the various risks described herein, but also on our success in identifying and appropriately addressing issues that may arise in areas such as potential conflicts of interest, anti-money laundering, client personal information and privacy issues, customer and other third party fraud, record-keeping, technology-related issues including but not limited to cyber fraud, regulatory investigations and any litigation that may arise from the failure or perceived failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements. Maintaining our reputation also depends on our ability to successfully prevent third parties from infringing on our brands and associated trademarks and our other intellectual property. Defense of our reputation, trademarks and other intellectual property, including through litigation, could result in costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur information and customer systems may experience an interruption or security breach.\nOur communications, information, technology and customer systems supporting our operations are important to our efficiency and vulnerable to unforeseen problems. Our operations depend on our ability, as well as that of third party service providers, to protect computer systems and network infrastructure against damage from fires, other natural disasters and pandemics, power or telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or wars or other catastrophic events, or other physical failures. Any damage or failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems, including, but not limited to, denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security breaches, could result in loss of customer information and/or failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure, interruption or security breach of our information and customer systems, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of our communications, information, technology and customer systems could result in liability to clients or loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, reputation, or results of operations. In addition, recovery from any of the mentioned areas of concern may be costly in terms of employee attention and out-of-pocket expenses.\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nWe regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, compliance monitoring activities and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well-designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, reputation and financial condition. In addition, if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are required to restate our financial statements, we could be required to implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures. We could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and potentially subject us to litigation. Any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or restatement of our financial statements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, reputation, and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we take title.\nIn the course of our business, we may own or foreclose and take title to real estate, and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. Environmental liabilities may require the Company to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit the Company\u2019s ability to use or sell the affected property. We may be held liable by a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we ever become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses.\nIn accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses to provide for loan and lease defaults and non-performance and a reserve for unfunded loan commitments, which, when combined, we refer to as the allowance for credit losses. Our allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to address actual credit losses, and future provisions for credit losses could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Our allowance for credit losses is based on prior experience and an evaluation of the risks in the current portfolio. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates that may be beyond our control, and these losses may exceed current estimates. Our federal and state regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, review our loans and leases and allowance for credit losses. While we believe our allowance for credit losses is appropriate for the risk identified in the Company's loan and lease portfolio, we cannot assure you that we will not further increase the allowance for credit losses, that it will be sufficient to address losses, or that regulators will not require us to increase this allowance. Any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our earnings. See \"Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for more information.\nOur acquisitions may subject us to unknown risks.\nWe have completed 27 acquisitions since May 2000. Certain events may arise after the date of an acquisition, or we may learn of certain facts, events or circumstances after the closing of an acquisition, that may affect our financial condition or performance or subject us to risk of loss. These events include, but are not limited to: litigation resulting from circumstances occurring at the acquired entity prior to the date of acquisition; loan downgrades and credit loss provisions resulting from underwriting of certain acquired loans determined not to meet our credit standards; personnel changes that cause instability within a department; delays in implementing new policies or procedures or the failure to apply new policies or procedures; and other events relating to the performance of our business. Acquisitions involve inherent uncertainty and we cannot determine all potential events, facts and circumstances that could result in loss or increased costs or give assurances that our investigation or mitigation efforts will be sufficient to protect against any such loss or increased costs.\nOur ability to execute strategic activities successfully will depend on a variety of factors. These factors likely will vary on the nature of the activity but may include our success in integrating the operations, services, products, personnel and systems of an acquired company into our business, operating effectively with any partner with whom we elect to do business, retaining key employees, achieving anticipated synergies, meeting expectations and otherwise realizing the undertaking's anticipated benefits. Our ability to address these matters successfully cannot be assured. In addition, our strategic efforts may divert resources or management's attention from ongoing business operations and may subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny. If we do not successfully execute a strategic undertaking, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation, regulatory relationships and growth prospects. In addition, if we were able to conclude that the value of an acquired business had decreased and that the related goodwill had been impaired, that conclusion would result in an impairment of goodwill charge to us, which would adversely affect our results of operations. To the extent we issue capital stock in connection with additional transactions, these transactions and related stock issuances may have a dilutive effect on earnings per share and share ownership.\nA natural disaster could harm the Company's business.\nThe nature and level of natural disasters cannot be predicted and may be exacerbated by global climate change. These natural disasters could harm our operations through interference with communications, including the interruption or loss of our computer systems, which could prevent or impede the Company from gathering deposits, originating loans and processing and controlling its flow of business, as well as through the destruction of facilities and our operational, financial and management information systems. California, in which a substantial portion of our business is located and a substantial portion of our loan collateral is located, is susceptible to natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, droughts and wild fires, and is currently in the midst of an ongoing drought. Such natural disasters could negatively impact our business operations, the values of collateral securing our loans and/or interrupt our borrowers' abilities to conduct their business in a manner to support their debt obligations, which could result in losses and increased provisions for credit losses.\nOur decisions regarding the fair value of assets acquired could be inaccurate which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects.\nManagement makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of acquired loans, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of secured loans. In acquisitions that include loss sharing agreements with the FDIC, we may record a loss sharing asset that we consider adequate to absorb future losses which may occur in the acquired loan portfolio. In determining the realization of the loss sharing asset, we analyze the expected cash flows, volume and classification of loans, volume and trends in delinquencies and nonaccruals, local economic conditions, and other pertinent information. If our assumptions are incorrect, the balance of the FDIC loss sharing asset may at any time be insufficient to cover future loan losses or subject to accelerated amortization. Any increase in future losses on loans and other assets covered by loss sharing agreements as well as any decrease in the expected cash flows from the FDIC could have a negative effect on our operating results.\nThe change of control rules under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code may limit our ability to use net operating loss carryovers and other tax attributes to reduce future tax payments or our willingness to issue equity.\nWe have net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes that can be utilized to offset future taxable income. If we were to undergo a change in ownership of more than 50% of our capital stock over a three-year period as measured under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes after the ownership change generally would be limited. The annual limit would equal the product of the applicable long term tax exempt rate and the value of the relevant taxable entity's capital stock immediately before the ownership change. These change of ownership rules generally focus on ownership changes involving stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5% or more (the \"5-Percent Shareholders\") of a company's outstanding stock, including certain public groups of stockholders as set forth under Section 382, and those arising from new stock issuances and other equity transactions, which may limit our willingness and ability to issue new equity. The determination of whether an ownership change occurs is complex and not entirely within our control. No assurance can be given as to whether we have undergone, or in the future will undergo, an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nIn April 2014, the Board of Directors adopted a tax benefit preservation plan (the \"Tax Plan\") which was designed to preserve the net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes of the Company. The Tax Plan is intended to discourage persons from becoming 5-Percent Shareholders and existing 5-Percent Shareholders from increasing their beneficial ownership of shares.\nAlthough the Tax Plan is intended to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change that could adversely affect the Company, there can be no assurance that such restrictions would prevent all transfers that could result in such an ownership change and thus no assurance can be given as to whether the Company could utilize the net operating losses to offset future taxable income. Additionally, because the Tax Plan may have the effect of restricting a stockholder's ability to dispose of or acquire the common stock of the Company, the liquidity and market value of our common stock might suffer.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to examinations and challenges by taxing authorities.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are routinely subjected to examinations and challenges from federal and state taxing authorities regarding tax positions taken by the Company and the determination of the amount of tax due. These examinations may relate to income, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property, sales and use, or other tax returns filed, or not filed, by the Company. The challenges made by taxing authorities may result in adjustments to the amount of taxes due, and may result in the imposition of penalties and interest. If any such challenges are not resolved in the Company's favor, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to changes in federal and state tax laws and changes in interpretation of existing laws.\nThe Company's financial performance is impacted by federal and state tax laws. Given the current economic and political environment, and ongoing budgetary pressures, the enactment of new federal or state tax legislation may occur. The enactment of such legislation, or changes in the interpretation of existing law, including provisions impacting income tax rates, apportionment, consolidation or combination, income, expenses, and credits, may have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nWe are subject to claims and litigation which could adversely affect our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations, or cause significant reputational harm to us.\nWe may be involved, from time to time, in litigation pertaining to our business activities. If such claims and legal actions, whether founded or unfounded, are not resolved in a manner favorable to us they may result in significant financial liability. Although we establish accruals for legal matters when and as required by generally accepted accounting principles and certain expenses and liabilities in connection with such matters may be covered by insurance, the amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially higher than the amounts accrued and/or insured. Substantial legal liability could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nWe may not pay dividends on common stock.\nOur stockholders are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future. Our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders is subject to the restrictions set forth in Delaware law, by our federal regulator, and by certain covenants contained in our subordinated debentures and borrowing agreements. Notification to the FRB is also required prior to our declaring and paying a cash dividend to our stockholders during any period in which our quarterly and/or cumulative twelve-month net earnings are insufficient to fund the dividend amount, among other requirements. We may not pay a dividend should the FRB object until such time as we receive approval from the FRB or we no longer need to provide notice under applicable regulations. In addition, we may be restricted by applicable law or regulation or actions taken by our regulators, or as a result of our participation in any future specific government stabilization programs, now or in the future, from paying dividends to our stockholders. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will continue paying dividends on our common stock at current levels or at all. Our failure to pay dividends on our common stock could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the market price of our common stock.\nThe primary source of the holding company's liquidity from which, among other things, we pay dividends is the receipt of dividends from the Bank.\nThe holding company, PacWest, is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and our other subsidiaries. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank and other factors, that the FRB, the FDIC and/or the DBO could assert that payment of dividends or other payments is an unsafe or unsound practice, or that such regulatory authority may impose restrictions on the Bank's ability to pay dividends as a condition to the Bank's participation in any stabilization program. In the event the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the holding company, it is likely that we, in turn, would have to stop paying dividends on our common stock and may have difficulty meeting our other financial obligations, including payments in respect of any outstanding indebtedness or trust preferred securities. The inability of the Bank to pay dividends to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, including on the market price of our common stock.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline.\nThe trading price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;\n\u2022\nchanges in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet analysts\u2019 revenue or earnings estimates;\n\u2022\ncyber security breaches;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nactions by institutional stockholders;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry;\n\u2022\nproposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments;\n\u2022\nanticipated or pending investigations, proceedings or litigation that involve or affect us; or\n\u2022\ndomestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance.\nThe stock market and, in particular, the market for financial institution stocks, has experienced significant volatility during the past several years and the future performance of the stock market is inherently uncertain. As a result, the stock market generally and the market price of our common stock specifically may be volatile. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate more than usual and cause significant price variations to occur. The trading price of the shares of our common stock and the value of our other securities will depend on many factors, which may change from time to time, including, without limitation, our financial condition, performance, creditworthiness and prospects, and future sales of our equity or equity-related securities. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers\u2019 underlying financial strength. A significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for individual stockholders and could lead to costly and disruptive securities litigation.", "PERMNO": 88343, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "PACW"}
