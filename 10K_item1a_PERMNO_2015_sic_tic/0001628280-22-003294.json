{"cik": "1012100", "company": "SEALED AIR CORP/DE", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIntroduction\nThe risks described below should be carefully considered before making an investment decision. These are the most significant risk factors, but they are not the only risk factors that should be considered in making an investment decision. This Form 10-K also contains and may incorporate by reference forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See the \u201cCautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d immediately preceding Part I, of this Form 10-K. Our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks, and investors in our securities may lose all or part of their investment.\nStrategic Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact the health and safety of our employees, our business continuity, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, including the outbreak of variants such as Delta and Omicron, and the related containment and mitigation measures that have been put into place across the globe, have had and may continue to have adverse impact on the global economy and our business. We and some of our customers have experienced facility shutdowns or reductions in operations during the pandemic. The outbreak of recent variants has also adversely impacted the staffing level in our operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to result in supply chain and operational disruptions such as the availability and transportation of raw materials or the ability for our packaging and equipment specialists to visit customer facilities. Unpredictable disruptions to the Company\u2019s operations or our customers\u2019 operations could reduce our future revenues and negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nIn addition, economic and market volatility due to the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact consumer buying habits, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe extent to which our operations may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in the future will depend largely on continued developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the outbreak, including new variants of the virus, and actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak or treat its impact, including the effectiveness and distribution of vaccines.\nThe global nature of our operations exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe operate in 46 countries/territories, and our products are distributed in 114 countries/territories around the world. A large portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside of the U.S. and 47% of our net sales are generated outside of the U.S. These operations, particularly those in developing regions, are subject to various risks that may not be present in or as significant for our U.S. operations. Economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we operate, including developing regions, could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from our operations in those markets.\nRisks inherent in our international operations include:\n\u2022inflationary pressures, including wage inflation and input cost inflation, as well as the impact of fiscal policy interventions by national or regional governments to control inflation;\n\u2022foreign currency exchange controls and tax rates;\n\u2022foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, including devaluations;\n\u2022adverse impacts resulting from regional or global human health related illnesses;\n\u2022restrictive governmental actions such as those on transfer or repatriation of funds and trade protection matters, including anti-dumping duties, tariffs, embargoes and prohibitions or restrictions on acquisitions or joint ventures;\n\u2022changes in laws and regulations, including the laws and policies of the U.S. and foreign countries affecting trade and foreign investment;\n\u2022the impact of customer perceptions or regulatory developments related to sustainability concerns;\n\u2022the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u2022variations in protection of intellectual property and other legal rights;\n\u2022more expansive legal rights of foreign unions or works councils;\n\u2022changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022import and export delays caused, for example, by an extended strike at the port of entry, could cause a delay in our supply chain operations;\n\u2022social plans that prohibit or increase the cost of certain restructuring actions;\n\u2022the potential for governmental actions that may result in expropriation or nationalization of our facilities or other assets in that country;\n\u2022unsettled political conditions and possible terrorist attacks against U.S. or other interests; and\n\u2022potential tax inefficiencies and tax costs in repatriating funds from our non-U.S. subsidiaries.\nThese and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations and, consequently, on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nUncertain global economic conditions may have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nUncertain global economic conditions, including the impact of inflationary pressure across the global economy, may have an adverse impact on our business in the form of lower volumes sold due to weakened demand, unfavorable changes in product price/mix, or lower profit margins. For example, in the past, global economic downturns have adversely impacted some of our customers and end-users, such as food processors, distributors, supermarket retailers, restaurants, industrial manufacturers, retail establishments, business service contractors and e-commerce and mail order fulfillment firms, and other end-users that are particularly sensitive to business and consumer spending. Additionally, in 2021, widespread inflationary pressures were experienced across global economies, resulting in higher costs for our raw materials, non-material cost components and labor.\nDuring economic downturns or recessions, there can be a heightened competition for sales and increased pressure to reduce selling prices as our customers may reduce their volume of purchases from us. If we lose significant sales volume or reduce selling prices significantly, there could be a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, profitability or cash flows.\nAlso, reduced availability of credit may adversely affect the ability of some of our customers and suppliers to obtain funds for operations and capital expenditures. This could negatively impact our ability to obtain necessary supplies as well as our sales of materials and equipment to affected customers. This could also result in reduced or delayed collections of outstanding accounts receivable.\nWe experience competition in the markets for our products and services and in the geographic areas in which we operate.\nOur packaging products and equipment solution offerings compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with a number of other types of materials or products. We compete on the basis of performance characteristics of our products, as well as service, price, sustainability and innovations in technology. A number of competing domestic and foreign companies are well-established.\nCustomers in the e-commerce and food service industry and peers in the packaging industry have been consolidating in recent years, and we believe this trend may continue. Such consolidation could have an adverse impact on the pricing of our products and services and our ability to retain customers, which could in turn adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur inability to maintain a competitive advantage could result in lower prices or lower sales volumes for our products. Additionally, we may not successfully implement our pricing actions. These factors may have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nConcerns about the impact that some plastic materials may have on the environment, along with changes in legal or regulatory requirements, development of recycling infrastructure, consumer preferences or market measures to address these concerns, may negatively affect our business and operations.\nPublic attention to plastic waste and its associated or perceived environmental impact continues to receive attention. Some jurisdictions have laws and regulations that govern the registration, labeling and taxation or surcharges of some of our products. For example, some of our products will be subject to a tax on certain plastics, which is currently scheduled to go into effect in\n2022 in the United Kingdom. Consumer perceptions, preferences and buying behaviors may change as a result of public attention to plastic waste and current and future regulations.\nCurrently, single-use plastic bans and/or proposals have focused on specific items such as grocery bags, cutlery, beverage straws and stir sticks, expanded polystyrene or oxo-degradable plastic. At present, all of the products we manufacture are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurances regarding future laws and regulations.\nWe maintain programs designed to comply with laws and regulations and to monitor their evolution. We also continue to innovate our packaging solutions to exceed recyclability or reusability requirements, address cube optimization to eliminate non-recyclable plastic waste, and increase the use of recycled and/or renewable materials. We believe that execution of our strategy positions us to exceed sustainability and recyclability demands of our customers with innovative solutions and new formulations of our materials. However, future development of government policies including taxation to restrict waste imports and/or expand bans beyond single-use plastics, as well as changes in customer preferences, may have an adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe execution of future acquisitions or investments in other companies may be limited by the availability of suitable candidates. Additionally, we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses without significant use of resources or diversion of management\u2019s attention.\nAcquisitions and non-controlling or equity investments are subject to the availability of suitable candidates or investment opportunities. Business acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulty in determining valuation, integration of acquired operations, technologies, services and products, key personnel turnover, and the diversion of management's attention from other business matters. Ultimately, we may be unable to achieve the expected benefits which could adversely affect our business and execution of our strategy.\nAs a result of acquisitions, we may record a significant amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets and we may never realize the full carrying value of the related assets.\nAs a result of acquisitions, we may record a significant amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets, including customer relationships, trademarks and developed technologies.\nWe test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for possible impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In the event that we determine that events or circumstances exist that indicate that the carrying value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets may no longer be recoverable, we might have to recognize a non-cash impairment of goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nPolitical and economic instability and risk of government actions affecting our business and our customers or suppliers may adversely impact our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe are exposed to risks inherent in doing business in each of the countries or territories in which we or our customers or suppliers operate including: civil unrest, acts of terrorism, sabotage, epidemics, force majeure, war or other armed conflict and related government actions, including sanctions/embargoes, the deprivation of contract rights, the inability to obtain or retain licenses required by us to operate our plants or import or export our goods or raw materials, the expropriation or nationalization of our assets, and restrictions on travel, payments or the movement of funds. Geopolitical events may have a negative impact on the global industrial macro-economic environment and could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIf we are not able to protect our trade secrets or maintain our trademarks, patents and other intellectual property, we may not be able to prevent competitors from developing similar products or from marketing their products in a manner that capitalizes on our trademarks, and this loss of a competitive advantage may adversely impact our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property. If we were unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our intellectual property and our significant current or future products, the resulting loss of associated competitive advantage could lead to decreased sales or increased operating costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on trade secrets to maintain our competitive position, including protecting the formulation and manufacturing techniques of many of our products. As such, we have not sought U.S. or international patent protection for some of our principal product formulas and manufacturing processes. Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent others from developing products that are similar to or competitive with our products.\nWe own a large number of patents and pending patent applications on our products, aspects thereof, methods of use and/or methods of manufacturing. There is a risk that our patents may not provide meaningful protection and patents may never be issued for our pending patent applications.\nWe own, or have licenses to use, all of the material trademark and trade name rights used in connection with the packaging, marketing and distribution of our major products both in the U.S. and in other countries/territories where our products are principally sold. Trademark and trade name protection is important to our business. Although most of our trademarks are registered in the U.S. and in the foreign countries/territories in which we operate, we may not be successful in asserting trademark or trade name protection. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries/territories may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. The costs required to protect our trademarks and trade names may be substantial.\nWe cannot be certain that we will be able to assert these intellectual property rights successfully in the future or that they will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Other parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and may thereby dilute the value of our intellectual property in the marketplace. Third parties, including competitors, may assert intellectual property infringement or invalidity claims against us that could be upheld. Intellectual property litigation, which could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us, may be necessary to protect our trade secrets or proprietary technology or for us to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of others\u2019 proprietary rights. We may not prevail in any such litigation, and if we are unsuccessful, we may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all.\nAny failure by us to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOperational Risks\nRaw material pricing, including how our selling prices reflect the cost of raw materials, availability and allocation by suppliers as well as energy-related costs may negatively impact our results of operations, including our profit margins.\nWe use petrochemical-based raw materials to manufacture many of our products. The prices for these raw materials are cyclical and increases in market demand or fluctuations in the global trade for petrochemical-based raw materials and energy could increase our costs, such as those experienced during 2021.\nWhile historically we have been able to successfully manage the impact of higher raw material costs by increasing our selling prices, if we were unable to minimize the effects of increased raw material costs through sourcing, pricing or other actions, our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected. A portion of our sales prices, specifically within Food's North American and APAC business, is determined using formula based pricing which reflects changes in underlying raw material indices. On average, formula based pricing lags raw material cost movement by approximately six months. We may experience a benefit (when resin prices decrease) or detriment (when resin prices increase) to our cost of sales before those price changes are reflected in our selling prices. As such, trends in raw material pricing may have a negative impact on future profit margins. We also have some sole-source suppliers, and the lack of availability of supplies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nNatural disasters, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake or other severe weather event, as well as political instability and terrorist activities, may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers and suppliers of other raw materials in the future. For example, throughout 2021, the Company experienced supply chain disruptions and sharp raw material price increases resulting, in part, from disruptions caused by Winter Storm Uri in February 2021. These factors could lead to increased prices for our raw materials, curtailment of supplies, allocation of raw materials, and other force majeure events of our suppliers and harm relations with our customers which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nUnfavorable customer responses to price increases could have a material adverse impact on our sales and earnings.\nFrom time to time, and especially in periods of rising raw material costs, we increase the prices of our products. For example, throughout 2021, the Company enacted pricing actions, which included price increases across our portfolio. Significant price increases could impact our earnings depending on, among other factors, the pricing by competitors of similar products and the\nresponse by the customers to higher prices. Such price increases may result in lower volume of sales and a subsequent decrease in gross margin and adversely impact our results of operations.\nDemand for our products could be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences or if we are not able to innovate and bring new products to market.\nOur sales depend heavily on the volumes of sales by our customers in food processing and service industries, the industrial manufacturing and electronics sectors, and e-commerce. Consumer preferences for food and durable goods packaging can influence our sales. Consumer preferences for fresh and unpackaged foods and the global e-commerce and industrial market change over time. Changes in consumer behavior, including changes driven by cost, availability, durability, sustainability, innovation, or various health or environmental-related concerns and perceptions, could negatively impact demand for our products.\nInnovation, particularly related to our automation, sustainability and digital offerings, is key to our strategy. Our performance and prospects for future growth could be adversely affected if new products do not meet sales or margin expectations and we are not able to meet our innovation rate goals. Our customers' preferences continue to trend towards sustainable and automated packaging solutions. We believe that we are well positioned to offer these solutions to our customers, but our success is dependent on continued innovation in sustainability and our ability to bring new products to market in an efficient manner.\nOur competitive advantage is due in part to our ability to develop and introduce new and sustainable products in a timely manner at favorable margins. The development and introduction cycle of new products can be lengthy and involve high levels of investment. New products may not meet sales or margin expectations due to many factors, including our inability to (i) accurately predict demand, end-user preferences and evolving industry and regulatory standards; (ii) resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and cost-effective manner; or (iii) achieve manufacturing efficiencies.\nCyber risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties with which we do business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe are subject to an increasing number of information technology vulnerabilities, threats and targeted computer crimes which pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers, or cyber attacks or security breaches of our networks or systems, or networks or systems of our customers and key vendors, could result in the loss of customers and business opportunities, legal liability, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, and additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations. To mitigate these threats to our business, we maintain a cybersecurity program aligned with industry frameworks designed to protect, detect, and respond to internal and external threats. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, attacks attempting to breach the security of our network and systems, none have resulted in a breach with material impact or any penalties or settlement for the three years ended December 31, 2021.\nWe also maintain and have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer controls. Despite our efforts to protect such sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, our facilities and systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe regulatory environment surrounding cybersecurity and data privacy is increasingly demanding, with new and changing regulations. We could be required to expend additional resources to comply with any such regulations, and failure to comply could subject us to significant penalties or claims.\nSupply chain disruptions related to the transport of raw materials and/or finished goods may delay the timing of when we are able to manufacture our product or serve our customers, which could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe rely on third-party logistics suppliers for the distribution and transportation of raw materials, operating supplies and products. Delays, fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure may adversely impact our ability to manufacture and distribute products. Specifically,\nmany key ports around the world experienced delays and backlogs in 2021. The Company may also incur higher tariffs and duties to obtain materials from suboptimized sourcing locations. Additionally, transportation costs may increase as freight carriers raise prices to address the overall market conditions. There is no guarantee that we will be able to recover any past or future increases in transportation costs. While we have a geographically diverse international presence and are situated in close proximity to many significant customers, continued supply chain disruptions related to the transport of raw materials and/or finished goods could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nLarge-scale animal health issues as well as other health issues affecting the food industry and disruptive forces of nature, including those resulting from climate change, such as significant regional droughts, prolonged severe weather conditions, floods, and natural disasters, may lead to decreased revenues.\nWe manufacture and sell food packaging products, among other products. Various forces of nature affecting the food industry have in the past and may in the future have a negative effect on the sales of food packaging products. Outbreaks of animal diseases may lead governments to restrict exports and imports of potentially affected animals and food products, leading to decreased demand for our products and possibly also to the culling or slaughter of significant numbers of the animal population otherwise intended for food supply. Other disruptive forces of nature such as droughts, floods and other severe weather can lead to agricultural market disruptions resulting in reduced herd size or modifications to the traditional herd cycles which could affect supply or demand for our products. Also, consumers may change their eating habits as a result of perceived problems with certain types of food. These factors may lead to reduced sales of food packaging products, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nA major loss of or disruption in our manufacturing and distribution operations or our information systems and telecommunication resources could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIf we were to experience a natural disaster, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake or other severe weather event, a casualty loss from an event such as a fire or flood, at one of our larger strategic facilities, or experience adverse impacts, such as plant shutdowns or travel restrictions due to regional or global human health related illness or if such events were to affect a key supplier, our supply chain or our information systems and telecommunication resources, then there could be a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. We are dependent on internal and third-party information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information. In particular, we depend on our information technology infrastructure for fulfilling and invoicing customer orders, applying cash receipts, and placing purchase orders with suppliers, making cash disbursements, and conducting digital marketing activities, data processing and electronic communications among business locations.\nWe also depend on telecommunication systems for communications between company personnel and our customers and suppliers. Future system disruptions, security breaches or shutdowns could significantly disrupt our operations or result in lost or misappropriated information and may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIf we are unable to retain key employees and other personnel, our consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected or we may not be able to execute our strategies.\nThe execution and success of our strategy depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our management team and other key personnel. Their experience and industry contacts significantly benefit us, and we need their expertise to execute our business strategies, including our strategies related to automation, digital and sustainability. If any such employee were to cease working for us and we were unable to replace them, our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nWe could experience disruptions in operations and/or increased labor costs.\nWe depend on the skills, working relationships, and continued services of employees, including our direct manufacturing employees. The labor market in many geographic regions, including the United States, is becoming increasingly competitive. Higher turnover may lead to reductions in operational efficiencies. Additionally, in Europe and Latin America, the majority of our employees are represented by either labor unions or workers' councils and are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are generally renewable on an annual basis. As is the case with any negotiation, we may not be able to negotiate acceptable new collective bargaining agreements, which could result in strikes or work stoppages by affected workers. Renewal of collective bargaining agreements could also result in higher wages or benefits paid to union members. A shortage in the labor pool and other general inflationary pressures or changes, the results of our labor negotiations and changes to applicable laws\nand regulations could increase labor costs, or cause a disruption in operations, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nWe are the subject of various legal proceedings, and may be subject to future claims and litigation, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings, including the securities class action lawsuit and the stockholder derivative action described in Part I, Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d. Litigation, in general, and securities, derivative actions and class action litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these proceedings may involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. Litigation and other adverse legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect our businesses, operating results and/or cash flows because of reputational harm to us caused by such proceedings, the cost of defending such proceedings, the cost of settlement or judgments against us or the changes in our operations that could result from such proceedings. Although we maintain legal liability insurance coverage, potential litigation claims could be excluded or exceed coverage limits under the terms of our insurance policies or could result in increased costs for such coverage.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of environmental laws that expose us to regulatory scrutiny, potential financial liability and increased operating costs.\nOur operations are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the manufacture of our products, handling, transportation, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, and the discharge of pollutants into the air, soil and water along with similar legislation aimed at addressing climate change issues.\nMany jurisdictions require us to have operating permits for our production and warehouse facilities and operations. Any failure to obtain, maintain or comply with the terms of these permits could result in fines or penalties, revocation or nonrenewal of our permits, or orders to cease certain operations, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe generate, use and dispose of hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes. In the event our operations result in the release of hazardous materials into the environment, we may become responsible for the costs associated with the investigation and remediation of sites at which we have released pollutants, or sites where we have disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes, even if we fully complied with applicable environmental laws at the time of disposal. We have been, and may continue to be, responsible for the cost of remediation at some locations.\nWe are also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that regulate products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans, animals and processed foods. In the U.S., these requirements are generally administered by the FDA. We maintain programs designed to comply with these laws and regulations and to monitor their evolution. To date, the cost of complying with product registration requirements and FDA compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAs countries progress towards long-term environmental stewardship goals, we expect laws and tax policy to continue to advance. For example, in July 2021, the European Union announced \"Fit for 55\" which is a series of laws and restrictions aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55%. SEE has processes in place and internal goals related to operating efficiency in matters such as greenhouse gas emissions, energy usage, and water consumption. There is no guarantee these internal goals will be more restrictive than future legislation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Additionally, some of SEE's materials or products will be subject to a tax on certain plastics or plastic components, which are currently scheduled to go into effect in 2022 in jurisdictions such as the United States and the United Kingdom. There is no guarantee that we will be able to recover the impact of plastic taxes from our customers. We maintain programs designed to comply with laws and regulations and to monitor their evolution.\nWe cannot predict with reasonable certainty the future cost to us of environmental compliance, product registration, or environmental remediation. Environmental laws have become more stringent and complex over time. Our environmental costs and operating expenses will be subject to evolving regulatory requirements and will depend on the scope and timing of the effectiveness of requirements in these various jurisdictions. As a result of such requirements, we may be subject to an increased regulatory burden, and we expect significant future environmental compliance obligations in our operations. Increased compliance costs, increasing risks and penalties associated with violations, or our inability to market some of our products in certain jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nProduct liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial results or harm our reputation or the value of our brands.\nClaims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of our business. In addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments, product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace or adversely impact the value of our brands or our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions. We could also be required to recall possibly defective products, or voluntarily do so, which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. Although we maintain product liability insurance coverage, potential product liability claims could be excluded or exceed coverage limits under the terms of our insurance policies or could result in increased costs for such coverage.\nFuture changes in global trade policies and regulations, as well as overall uncertainty surrounding international trade relations, could have a material adverse effect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nFuture changes in global trade policies and regulations, including tariffs on products we import and export, could have an adverse impact on our business. Additionally, future trade policies and regulations are due in part to international relations and other geopolitical factors outside of our control. In order to mitigate the impact of these trade-related increases on our costs of products sold, we may increase prices in certain markets and, over the longer term, make changes in our supply chain and, potentially, our global manufacturing strategy. Implementing price increases may cause our customers to find alternative sources for their products. We may be unable to successfully pass along these costs through price increases; adjust our supply chain without incurring significant costs; or locate alternative suppliers for raw materials or finished goods at acceptable costs or in a timely manner. Our inability to effectively manage the negative impacts of changing U.S. and foreign trade policies could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) has indicated that it intends to disallow our deduction of the approximately $1.49 billion for the payments made pursuant to the Settlement agreement (as defined below).\nIn the past, we have reduced taxable income by approximately $1.49 billion for the payments made pursuant to the Settlement agreement and thus have reduced our U.S. federal tax liability by approximately $525 million. The IRS has proposed to disallow, as deductible expense, the entirety of the $1.49 billion settlement payments. Although we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the proposed disallowance and have filed a protest with the IRS, this matter may not be resolved in 2022 and there can be no assurance that it will be resolved in the Company's favor. The matter has been submitted to the IRS Independent Office of Appeals for review of the proposed disallowance. An unfavorable resolution of this matter could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe are subject to taxation and tax controversies in multiple jurisdictions. As a result, any adverse development in the tax laws of any of these jurisdictions or any disagreement by the tax authorities with our tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe are subject to taxation in, and to the tax laws and regulations of, multiple jurisdictions as a result of the international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied.\nThere are various jurisdictions in which we operate which are actively considering changes to existing tax laws, that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business. Additional changes in tax laws could increase our overall taxes and our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected in a material way. The tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction, including the U.S., may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions. If any applicable tax authorities, including U.S. tax authorities, were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of our operations, or cash flows.\nWe are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in assessments against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods in which that development occurs. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical accruals.\nAlthough the Settlement agreement (as defined below) has been implemented and we have been released from the various asbestos-related, fraudulent transfer, successor liability, and indemnification claims made against us arising from a 1998 transaction with Grace (as defined below), if the courts were to refuse to enforce the injunctions or releases contained in the Plan (as defined below) and the Settlement agreement with respect to any claims and if Grace were unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify us for such claims, then we could be required to pay substantial damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. We were also a defendant in a number of asbestos-related actions in Canada arising from Grace\u2019s activities in Canada prior to the 1998 transaction.\nOn March 31, 1998, we completed a multi-step transaction (the \u201cCryovac transaction\u201d) involving W.R. Grace & Co. (\u201cGrace\u201d) which brought the Cryovac packaging business and the former Sealed Air\u2019s business under the common ownership of the Company. As part of that transaction, Grace and its subsidiaries retained all liabilities arising out of their operations before the Cryovac transaction (including asbestos-related liabilities), other than liabilities relating to Cryovac\u2019s operations, and agreed to indemnify the Company with respect to such retained liabilities. Beginning in 2000, we were served with a number of lawsuits alleging that the Cryovac transaction was a fraudulent transfer or gave rise to successor liability or both, and that as a result we were responsible for alleged asbestos liabilities of Grace and its subsidiaries. On April 2, 2001, Grace and a number of its subsidiaries filed petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the \u201cBankruptcy Court\u201d). In connection with Grace\u2019s Chapter 11 case, the Bankruptcy Court issued orders staying all asbestos actions against the Company (the \u201cPreliminary Injunction\u201d) but granted the official committees appointed to represent asbestos claimants in Grace\u2019s Chapter 11 case (the \u201cCommittees\u201d) permission to pursue fraudulent transfer, successor liability, and other claims against the Company and its subsidiary Cryovac, Inc. based upon the Cryovac transaction. In November 2002, we reached an agreement in principle with the Committees to resolve all current and future asbestos-related claims made against us and our affiliates, as well as indemnification claims by Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc. and affiliated companies, in each case, in connection with the Cryovac transaction (as memorialized by the parties and approved by the Bankruptcy Court, the \u201cSettlement agreement\u201d). A definitive Settlement agreement was entered into as of November 10, 2003 consistent with the terms of the agreement in principle. On June 27, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court approved the Settlement agreement and the Settlement agreement was subsequently incorporated into the plan of reorganization for Grace filed in September 2008 (as filed and amended from time to time, the \"Plan\"). Subsequently, the Bankruptcy Court (in January and February 2011) and the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (in January and June 2012) entered orders confirming Grace\u2019s plan of reorganization in its entirety.\nOn February 3, 2014 (the \u201cEffective Date\u201d), in accordance with the Plan, Grace emerged from bankruptcy. In accordance with the Plan and the Settlement agreement, on the Effective Date, Cryovac, Inc. made aggregate cash payments in the amount of $929.7 million to the WRG Asbestos PI Trust (the \u201cPI Trust\u201d) and the WRG Asbestos PD Trust (the \u201cPD Trust\u201d) and transferred 18 million shares of Sealed Air common stock to the PI Trust. Among other things, the Plan incorporated and implemented the Settlement agreement and provided for the establishment of two asbestos trusts under Section 524(g) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to which present and future asbestos-related personal injury and property damage claims are channeled. The Plan also provided injunctions and releases with respect to asbestos claims and certain other claims for our benefit. In addition, under the Plan and the Settlement agreement, Grace is required to indemnify us with respect to asbestos and certain other liabilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and although we believe the possibility to be remote, if any courts were to refuse to enforce the injunctions or releases contained in the Plan and the Settlement agreement with respect to any claims, and if, in addition, Grace were unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify us for such claims, then we could be required to pay substantial damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, profitability or cash flows.\nFinancial Risks\nFluctuations between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar could materially impact our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nApproximately 47% of our net sales in 2021 were generated outside the U.S. We translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into U.S. dollars for our Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, the Company is exposed to currency fluctuations both in receiving cash from its international operations and in translating its financial results into U.S. dollars. During periods of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported international sales and net earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer U.S. dollars. Foreign exchange rates can also impact the competitiveness of products produced in certain jurisdictions and exported for sale into other jurisdictions. These changes may impact the value received for the sale of our goods versus those of our competitors. The Company cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on its future operating results. As exchange rates vary, the Company's results of operations and profitability may be adversely impacted. While we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures, this does not insulate us\ncompletely from foreign currency effects and exposes us to counterparty credit risk for non-performance. See Note 15, \u201cDerivatives and Hedging Activities,\u201d of the Notes. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial effect resulting from foreign currency variations. The gains or losses associated with hedging activities may negatively impact the Company's results of operations.\nIn all jurisdictions in which we operate, we are also subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment, foreign trade and currency exchange transactions. These laws and regulations may limit our ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the U.S. and may limit our ability to convert foreign currency cash flows into U.S. dollars.\nWe have recognized foreign exchange losses related to the currency devaluations in Argentina and its designation as a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP. See Note 2, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards,\u201d for additional information.\nOur operating results or cash flows can change materially as a result of changes in our geographic mix of U.S. and foreign earnings and other factors, including changes in tax laws and changes made by regulatory authorities.\nOur overall effective income tax rate is equal to our total income tax provision as a percentage of total earnings before tax. However, income tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis. Losses in one jurisdiction may not be used to offset profits in other jurisdictions and may cause an increase in our tax rate. Changes in the mix of earnings (or losses) between jurisdictions and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, among other factors, could have a significant effect on our overall effective income tax rate. Additionally, changes in tax laws or developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods in which that development occurs.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on time or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to affect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities, the indentures that govern our senior notes and the agreements covering our accounts receivable securitization programs restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nIn addition, we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries, certain of which are not guarantors of our indebtedness. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. The indenture governing certain of our senior notes and the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us. These limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default, our note holders and lenders could accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, the lenders could terminate their commitments to loan money and/or foreclose against the assets securing the borrowings, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nThe terms of our credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities, our accounts receivable securitization programs, our supply chain financing programs, and the indentures governing our senior notes may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or to take certain actions.\nThe indentures governing our senior notes and the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and our accounts receivable securitization programs contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock;\n\u2022prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022make loans and investments;\n\u2022sell assets;\n\u2022incur liens;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022alter the businesses we conduct;\n\u2022enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends; and\n\u2022consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants in the credit agreement governing our senior credit facilities require us to maintain a specified net leverage ratio. Our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control.\nA breach of the covenants under the indenture governing our senior notes or under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities would permit the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under those facilities. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our senior secured credit facilities, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event our lenders or note holders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. As a result of these restrictions, we may be:\n\u2022limited in how we conduct our business;\n\u2022unable to respond to changing market conditions;\n\u2022unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns or to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due; or\n\u2022unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nIn addition, amounts available under our accounts receivable securitization programs and/or utilization of our supply chain financing programs can be impacted by a number of factors, including but not limited to our credit ratings, accounts receivable or payable balances, the creditworthiness of us or our customers, our receivables collection experience and/or our trade payable payment history. Additionally, if our credit ratings were to be downgraded, particularly our Corporate Rating, there could be a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and borrowing costs could increase.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed will remain the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. As of December 31, 2021, we had $512 million of long-term borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities at variable interest rates. A 1/8% increase or decrease in the assumed interest rates on the senior secured credit facilities would result in a $0.6 million increase or decrease in annual interest expense. In the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.\nThe full realization of our deferred tax assets may be affected by a number of factors, including future earnings and the feasibility of on-going planning strategies.\nWe have deferred tax assets including state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, accruals not yet deductible for tax purposes, employee benefit items and other items. We have established valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Our ability to utilize the deferred tax assets depends in part upon our ability to generate future taxable income within each respective jurisdiction during the periods in which these temporary differences reverse or our ability to carryback any losses created by the deduction of these temporary differences. We expect to realize the assets over an extended period. If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in the U.S. and/or certain foreign jurisdictions, or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rate would increase if we were required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets.\nDisruption and volatility of the financial and credit markets could affect our external liquidity sources.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are accumulated cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flow from operations and amounts available under our lines of credit, including our senior secured credit facilities, and our accounts receivable securitization programs. We may be unable to refinance any of our indebtedness, including our senior notes, our accounts receivable securitization programs and our senior secured credit facilities, on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nAdditionally, conditions in financial markets could affect financial institutions with which we have relationships and could result in adverse effects on our ability to utilize fully our committed borrowing facilities. For example, a lender under the senior secured credit facilities may be unwilling or unable to fund a borrowing request, and we may not be able to replace such lender.\nOur insurance policies may not cover all operating risks and a casualty loss beyond the limits of our coverage could materially and adversely impact our business.\nOur business is subject to operating hazards and risks relating to handling, storing, transporting and use of the products we sell. We maintain insurance policies in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that we believe are reasonable and prudent. Nevertheless, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities and expenses that may arise from claims for personal injury or death or property damage arising in the ordinary course of business, and our current levels of insurance may not be maintained or available in the future at economical prices. If a significant liability claim is brought against us that is not adequately covered by insurance, we may have to pay the claim with our own funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.", "PERMNO": 85926, "SIC": 3081, "TIC": "SEE"}
