{"cik": "1105705", "company": "TIME WARNER INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe Company must respond successfully to changes in technology and consumer behavior to remain competitive. The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenues and profits from its cable networks, its premium pay television services and its production and licensing of television programming. Technological changes have driven and reinforced changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when, where and how they consume content. These changes pose long-term risks to the traditional television industry and many of the Company\u2019s historical business models. These risks include: (i) the disruption of the traditional television content delivery model by over-the-top aggregators of content if they are successful in drawing large audiences and significant revenues away from, or further discouraging younger audiences from subscribing to, multichannel video services; (ii) the disruption of the advertising-supported television model due to increased online video consumption, time-shifted viewing of television programs and the use of digital video recorders to skip advertisements; (iii) the decline in the value of a network\u2019s acquired programming if it does not obtain the exclusive right to distribute that programming on both television and digital platforms and that programming becomes readily available to consumers on other companies\u2019 platforms; (iv) an increase in Turner\u2019s and Home Box Office\u2019s costs to produce or acquire high-quality, must-watch programming due to heightened competition, including from SVOD services. The Company\u2019s responses to mitigate the risks from these changes, including the adoption of new business models and enhancing TV Everywhere, may not be embraced by consumers, advertisers, affiliates or others in the media and entertainment industry, which could have a significant adverse effect on the Company\u2019s competitive position and its businesses. In addition, the Company may incur significant costs to respond to, and mitigate the risks from, these changes.\nIndex to Financial Statements The popularity of content is difficult to predict and can change rapidly, and low public acceptance of the Company\u2019s content will adversely affect its results of operations. The revenues derived from the sale, distribution and licensing of television programming, feature films, videogames and other content depend primarily on widespread public acceptance of that content, which is difficult to predict and can change rapidly. The Company must invest substantial amounts in the production and marketing of its content before it learns whether such content will reach anticipated levels of popularity with consumers. The popularity of the Company\u2019s content depends on many factors, only some of which are within the Company\u2019s control. Examples include the popularity of competing content (including locally produced content internationally), the availability of alternative forms of leisure and entertainment activities, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain or develop strong brand awareness and target key audiences, and the Company\u2019s ability to successfully anticipate (and timely adapt its content to) changes in consumer tastes and behavior in the many countries and territories in which the Company operates. Low public acceptance of the Company\u2019s content will adversely affect its results of operations.\nGenerally, feature films that perform well at the box office also have commercial success in subsequent distribution channels. Therefore, the underperformance of a feature film, especially an \u201cevent\u201d film, at the box office can result in lower than expected revenues for the Company from the license of the film to broadcast and cable networks and SVOD services, sales of the film via EST and physical discs, and from the sale of videogames or licenses for consumer products based on such film. There is also a risk that a new \u201cevent\u201d film that fails to achieve commercial success at the box office, which would limit the Company\u2019s ability to create a new theatrical franchise based on the film or characters featured in such film. The failure to develop successful new theatrical franchises could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nWith respect to television programming produced by the Company, low ratings for such programming may lead to the cancellation of a program and can negatively affect future license fees for the cancelled program. A decline in the ratings or popularity of the television programming aired on Turner\u2019s cable networks can negatively affect advertising revenues for Turner\u2019s cable networks in the near term and, over a longer period of time, could adversely affect subscription revenues and the distribution potential of a Turner network. A decline in the popularity of HBO and Cinemax\u2019s programming could, over a period of time, cause subscribers to cancel their subscriptions, which in turn could adversely affect both the Company\u2019s subscription and content licensing revenues. In addition, if the Company decides to no longer air programming due to low ratings or other factors, the Company could incur significant programming impairments, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations in a given period.\nThe failure to renew affiliate agreements on favorable terms or at all could cause the Company\u2019s subscription and advertising revenues to decline. The Company depends on agreements with affiliates for the distribution of Turner\u2019s cable networks and HBO and Cinemax. Competition from SVOD services and new distribution platforms is increasing the pressure on affiliates to control their programming costs in order to continue to attract and retain subscribers. As affiliates continue to try to control their programming costs, it may be more difficult for the Company to renew its affiliate agreements on terms, including those related to pricing, packaging and positioning, that are acceptable to the Company. In addition, due to consolidation among affiliates in the U.S. and consolidation and growth of large multi-territory distribution companies internationally, these companies are gaining scale and negotiating power. If the Company is not able to renew its affiliate agreements on acceptable terms, its subscription revenues may not increase as much as the Company expects or could decline. In addition, the inability to renew one or more of the Company\u2019s larger affiliate arrangements would reduce the Company\u2019s subscription revenues and the reach of the Company\u2019s programming, which could make Turner\u2019s cable networks less attractive to advertisers and result in a decline in advertising revenues.\nA decline in the number of multichannel video service subscribers could cause the Company\u2019s subscription revenues to decline. If multichannel video service rates charged by affiliates continue to increase or economic conditions worsen, subscribers may (i) cancel their multichannel video service subscriptions, (ii) cancel their subscriptions to HBO and Cinemax or (iii) elect to subscribe to lower-priced programming packages that may not include HBO, Cinemax or all of Turner\u2019s cable networks. In addition, consumers, particularly younger consumers, may choose to subscribe to SVOD services as an alternative to multichannel video services provided by affiliates. The number of HBO and Cinemax subscribers could also decline if affiliates choose not to market, or reduce their marketing of, HBO and Cinemax. A decline in the number of subscribers to multichannel video services or HBO or Cinemax could result in a decrease in the Company\u2019s subscription revenues.\nA decrease in demand for the television programming produced by Warner Bros. could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues. Warner Bros. is a leading producer of high-quality television programming, as well as a leader in the international\nIndex to Financial Statements\ndistribution of U.S.-produced television programming. Despite its strong competitive position, Warner Bros.\u2019 television production business, is largely dependent on the strength of the U.S. broadcast networks, basic cable networks and local television stations, and their demand for Warner Bros.\u2019 television programming. If there is a decrease in such demand, it could decrease the overall scale of Warner Bros.\u2019 television production business, reduce the aggregate license fees for its television programming in the short-term and reduce the aggregate syndication revenues for its television programming in the long-term. The following factors could increase the likelihood of a decrease in such demand in the U.S.: (i) consolidation among television station groups and vertical integration between station groups and broadcast networks, thereby reducing the number of buyers for Warner Bros.\u2019 programming; (ii) vertical integration between television production studios and broadcast networks, resulting in increased reliance by networks on their in-house and affiliated television production studios; and (iii) emergence of technological advances and alternative viewing options that could reduce the lifetime value of television programming. In international territories, the increasing popularity of locally produced television content could result in decreased demand and lower license fees for the Company\u2019s U.S.-produced television programming.\nAn increase in the costs incurred by Turner and Home Box Office to acquire or produce popular programming could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results. Competition to acquire popular programming is intense, and the growing number of SVOD services has increased competition in the U.S. and internationally. Turner may have to increase the price it is willing to pay for acquired and sports programming, including the renewal of programming it currently licenses. Acquired and sports programming costs may also increase if Turner seeks the right to distribute the programming on digital platforms and the right to exhibit programming exclusively during the applicable license period. In addition, the increased amount of original programming aired by cable networks, premium pay television services and SVOD services could drive up talent and production costs. If increases in Turner\u2019s and Home Box Office\u2019s costs to produce or acquire popular programming are not offset by increases in advertising rates and affiliate fees when affiliate agreements are renewed, the Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected if there is a decline in advertising spending, which could be caused by a number of factors. A decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could cause current or prospective advertisers to spend less on television advertising or spend their advertising dollars in other media. Television advertising expenditures also could be negatively affected by (i) increasing audience fragmentation caused by increased availability of alternative forms of leisure and entertainment activities; (ii) the increased use of digital video recorders to skip advertisements; (iii) pressure from public interest groups to reduce or eliminate advertising of certain products on television; (iv) new laws and regulations that prohibit or restrict certain types of advertisements; and (v) natural disasters, extreme weather, acts of terrorism, political uncertainty or hostilities, because there may be uninterrupted news coverage of such events that disrupts regular television programming. In addition, advertisers\u2019 willingness to purchase advertising time from the Company may be adversely affected by a decline in audience ratings for the programming aired on Turner\u2019s cable networks. If ratings decline significantly, Turner\u2019s cable networks generally will be required to provide additional advertising time to advertisers to reach agreed-on audience delivery thresholds. This may result in Turner\u2019s cable networks having less advertising time available to sell or to use to promote their own programming. Finally, if the television ratings system is not changed so that it captures the viewership of Turner\u2019s programming through digital video recorders, VOD and mobile devices, advertisers may not be willing to pay advertising rates based on the increasing viewership that occurs after the initial airing of a program and on digital platforms.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations may be adversely affected if the growth in digital sales of television content and feature films do not exceed and offset the decline in physical disc sales. Several factors have contributed to an industry-wide decline in sales of physical discs in recent years, including consumers shifting to SVOD services; consumers electing to rent films using discount rental kiosks, which generate significantly less profit per transaction for the Company than the sale of physical discs; changing retailer strategies and initiatives (e.g., reduction in floor space devoted to physical discs); retail store closures; weak economic conditions; increasing competition for consumer discretionary time and spending; and piracy. The Company\u2019s efforts to offset the decline in sales of physical discs and to make digital ownership of content more compelling to consumers (e.g., UltraViolet and EST) may not be successful or may take several more years to become successful.\nIf the Company fails to compete successfully against alternative sources of entertainment and news, there may be an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations. The Company competes with all other sources of entertainment and news, including television, premium pay television services, SVOD services, feature films, the Internet, home entertainment\nIndex to Financial Statements\nproducts, videogames, social networking, print media, pirated content, live sports and other events, for consumers\u2019 leisure and entertainment time and discretionary spending. The number of media and entertainment choices available to consumers has made it much more difficult to attract and obtain their attention and time. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors.\nThe Company is exposed to risks associated with weak domestic and global economic conditions and increased volatility and disruption in the financial markets. The Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by weak domestic and global economic conditions and the impact of those conditions on advertisers, affiliates, suppliers, retailers, insurers, theater operators and others with which it does business. The global economy continues to be volatile, with particular regions and countries, such as Argentina, Brazil, the Eurozone, India, Russia and Venezuela, facing uncertain or slow economic growth. These conditions could lead to lower consumer spending for the Company\u2019s content and products in these regions and countries, particularly if advertisers, licensees, retailers, theater operators and consumers reduce their demand for the Company\u2019s content and products due to the negative impact of these conditions on them. Consumer spending in these regions and countries may be further negatively impacted by governmental actions to manage national economic matters, whether through austerity or stimulus measures or initiatives intended to control wages, unemployment, credit availability, inflation, taxation and other economic drivers.\nIncreased volatility and disruptions in the financial markets could make it more difficult and more expensive for the Company to refinance outstanding indebtedness and obtain new financing. In addition, the adoption of new statutes and regulations, new interpretations of existing statutes and regulations or the enforcement of laws and regulations applicable to the financial markets or the financial services industry could result in a reduction in the amount of available credit or an increase in the cost of credit. Disruptions in the financial markets can also adversely affect the Company\u2019s lenders, insurers and counterparties, including vendors, retailers and film co-financing partners. The inability of the Company\u2019s counterparties to obtain capital on acceptable terms could impair their ability to perform under agreements with the Company and lead to negative effects on the Company, including business disruptions, decreased revenues, increases in bad debt expenses and, in the case of film co-financing partners, greater risk to the Company with respect to the performance of its feature films.\nThe Company faces risks relating to conducting business internationally that could adversely affect its businesses and operating results. It is important for the Company to achieve sufficient scale in key international territories in a cost-effective manner to be able to compete successfully in those territories. Failure to achieve sufficient scale could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations. In addition, there are risks inherent in international business operations, including:\n\u2022\nissues related to integrating and managing international operations and investments;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax developments;\n\u2022\nlack of sufficient protection for intellectual property in some countries;\n\u2022\nterritorial restrictions on content licensing;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange restrictions, export controls and currency devaluation risks in some foreign countries, including, but not limited to, Argentina and Venezuela;\n\u2022\nthe existence in some countries of statutory shareholder minority rights and restrictions on foreign direct ownership;\n\u2022\nthe existence of quotas and other content-related limitations or restrictions (e.g., government censorship);\n\u2022\nrestrictions on television advertising, marketing and network packaging;\n\u2022\nissues related to occupational safety and adherence to local labor laws and regulations;\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u2022\npolitical or social unrest;\n\u2022\nhigher than anticipated costs of entry;\n\u2022\nthe presence of corruption in certain countries;\n\u2022\nthe absence of good diplomatic relations between the U.S. and certain countries; and\n\u2022\nthe potential for government appropriation of the Company\u2019s assets.\nOne or more of these factors could harm the Company\u2019s international operations or investments and its operating results.\nIn addition, some of the Company\u2019s operations are conducted in foreign currencies, and the value of these currencies fluctuates in relation to the U.S. dollar. The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Although the Company hedges a portion of its foreign currency exposures, significant fluctuations in exchange rates in the past have had, and in the future could have, an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations in a given period.\nSome of the Company\u2019s businesses generate cash receipts in Venezuela. The Venezuelan government has imposed significant limits on the exchange of local currency into U.S. dollars in recent years. Although Venezuela implemented changes during 2014 that increase the potential to convert Venezuelan Bolivars Fuertes (\u201cVEF\u201d) to U.S. dollars, the Company has been unable to exchange its VEF to U.S. dollars, and there can be no assurance as to when or if or the rate at which the Company will be able to exchange its VEF to U.S. dollars.\nIncreased piracy of the Company\u2019s content, products and other intellectual property may further decrease the revenues received from the legitimate sale, licensing and distribution of its content and adversely affect its business and profitability. The Company continues to be negatively affected by piracy, and an increase in the piracy of the Company\u2019s content, products and other intellectual property could reduce the revenues the Company earns from the legitimate sale, licensing and distribution of its content, products and other intellectual property. The risks relating to piracy have increased in recent years due to technological developments that have made it easier to create, distribute and store high-quality unauthorized copies of content, such as the proliferation of cloud-based storage and streaming services, increased broadband Internet speeds and penetration rates, and increased speed of mobile data transmission. Piracy is particularly prevalent in countries that lack effective copyright and technical legal protections or enforcement measures, and illegitimate operators based in those parts of the world can attract viewers from anywhere in the world. The Company devotes substantial resources to protecting its content, products and intellectual property, but the Company\u2019s efforts to enforce its rights and combat piracy may not be successful.\nThe Company\u2019s operating results may suffer if it cannot continue to license and exploit its intellectual property rights. The Company relies on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, tradenames and other proprietary rights, as well as contractual arrangements, including licenses, to establish, maintain and protect its intellectual property rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which the Company does business. The Company may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which it does business or prevent others from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe on, or diminish the value of, the Company\u2019s trademarks and other proprietary rights. Companies that license the Company\u2019s intellectual property also may take actions that diminish the value of the Company\u2019s intellectual property or harm the Company\u2019s reputation.\nThe Company\u2019s intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit it to take advantage of business opportunities, such as new distribution platforms. As a result, the Company may be required to change its plans or acquire the necessary intellectual property rights, which could be costly.\nThe protection of the Company\u2019s intellectual property may require the Company to spend significant amounts of money. Further, the steps the Company takes to protect its intellectual property may not adequately protect its rights or prevent others from infringing or misappropriating its intellectual proprietary rights. Any impairment of the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights, including due to changes in U.S. or foreign intellectual property laws or the absence of effective\nIndex to Financial Statements\nlegal protections or enforcement measures, could adversely impact the Company\u2019s businesses, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company has been, and may be in the future, subject to claims that it infringed intellectual property rights of others, which could require the Company to change its business practices. Successful claims that the Company infringes on the intellectual property rights of others could require the Company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability, be prohibited preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question or require the Company to change its business practices to stop the infringing use, which could limit its ability to compete effectively. Even if the Company believes a claim of intellectual property infringement is without merit, defending against the claim can be time-consuming and costly and divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from its businesses.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses are subject to labor interruption. The Company and some of its suppliers and business partners retain the services of writers, directors, actors, athletes, technicians, trade employees and others involved in the development and production of its television programming and feature films who are covered by collective bargaining agreements. If negotiations to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements are not successful or become unproductive, the affected unions could take actions such as strikes, work slowdowns or work stoppages. Strikes, work slowdowns or work stoppages or the possibility of such actions could result in delays in the production of the Company\u2019s television programming and feature films. The Company could also incur higher costs from such actions, new collective bargaining agreements or the renewal of collective bargaining agreements on less favorable terms. Many of the collective bargaining agreements that cover individuals providing services to the Company are industry-wide agreements, and the Company may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of these agreements. Union or labor disputes or player lock-outs relating to certain professional sports leagues may preclude the Company from producing and telecasting scheduled games or events and could negatively impact the Company\u2019s promotional and marketing opportunities. Depending on their duration, such union or labor disputes or player lock-outs could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nService disruptions or failures of the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 information systems and networks as a result of computer viruses, misappropriation of data or other bad acts, natural disasters, extreme weather, accidental releases of information or other similar events, may disrupt the Company\u2019s businesses, damage its reputation or have a negative impact on its results of operations. Shutdowns or service disruptions of information systems or networks at the Company or vendors that provide information systems, networks or other services to the Company pose increasing risks. Such disruptions may be caused by third-party hacking of computers and systems; dissemination of computer viruses, worms and other destructive or disruptive software; denial of service attacks and other bad acts, as well as power outages, natural disasters, extreme weather, terrorist attacks, or other similar events. Shutdowns or disruption from such events could have an adverse impact on the Company and its customers, including degradation or disruption of service, loss of data and damage to equipment and data. In addition, system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company\u2019s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient to cover everything that could happen. Significant events could result in a disruption of the Company\u2019s operations, reduced revenues, the loss of or damage to the integrity of data used by management to make decisions and operate the Company\u2019s business, customer or advertiser dissatisfaction, damage to the Company\u2019s reputation or brands or a loss of customers. In addition, the Company may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate it for any losses associated with such events.\nThe Company is also subject to risks caused by the misappropriation, misuse, falsification or intentional or accidental release or loss of data maintained in the information systems and networks of the Company and its vendors, including confidential personnel, customer or vendor data. Outside parties may attempt to penetrate the Company\u2019s systems or those of its vendors or fraudulently induce employees or customers of the Company or employees of its vendors to disclose sensitive information to obtain or gain access to the Company\u2019s data. If a material breach of the Company\u2019s information systems or that of its vendors occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s information security measures could be harmed, the Company could lose customers and advertisers, and its reputation, brands and credibility could be damaged. In addition, if a material breach of its information systems occurs, the Company could be required to expend significant amounts of money and other resources to repair or replace information systems or networks or to comply with notification requirements. The Company also could be subject to actions by regulatory authorities and claims asserted in private litigation in the event of a breach of the information systems of the Company or its vendors.\nIndex to Financial Statements Although the Company develops and maintains information security practices and systems designed to prevent these events from occurring, the development and maintenance of these systems are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and tactics to overcome information security measures become more sophisticated. Moreover, despite the Company\u2019s efforts, the possibility of these events occurring cannot be eliminated entirely. As the Company distributes more of its content digitally, engages in more electronic transactions with consumers, increases the number of information technology systems used in its business operations, relies more on cloud-based services and information systems and increases its use of third-party service providers to perform information technology services, the related information security risks will continue to increase and the Company will need to expend additional resources to protect its information systems, networks and data.\nService disruptions or the failure of communications satellites or transmitter facilities relied on by HBO, Cinemax and Turner\u2019s cable networks could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s revenues. HBO, Cinemax and Turner\u2019s cable networks rely on communications satellites and transmitter facilities to transmit their programming to affiliates. Shutdowns of satellites and transmitter facilities or service disruptions pose significant risks to the Company\u2019s operations. Such disruptions may be caused by power outages, natural disasters, extreme weather, terrorist attacks, failures or impairments of communications satellites or on-ground uplinks or downlinks used to transmit programming, or other similar events. If a satellite is not able to transmit the Company\u2019s programming, the Company may not be able to secure an alternative communication satellite in a timely manner, because there are a limited number of communications satellites available for the transmission of programming. If such an event were to occur, there could be a disruption in the delivery of the Company\u2019s programming, which could harm the Company\u2019s reputation and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses are subject to regulation in the U.S. and internationally, which could cause the Company to incur additional costs or liabilities or disrupt its business practices. The Company\u2019s businesses are subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Matters,\u201d for a description of significant U.S. federal, state, local and international laws, regulations, regulatory agency inquiries, rulemaking proceedings and other developments affecting the Company and its businesses. The Company could incur significant costs to comply with new laws or regulations or changes in interpretations of laws or regulations or substantial penalties or other liabilities if it fails to comply with them. Compliance with new laws or regulations also could cause the Company to change or limit its business practices in a manner that is adverse to its businesses. In addition, if there are changes in laws or regulations that provide protections that the Company relies on in conducting its businesses, these changes could subject the Company to greater risk of liability and could increase compliance costs or limit the Company\u2019s ability to operate certain lines of business.\nThe Company\u2019s cost reduction initiatives present various risks, including the risk that the Company may not realize the financial and strategic goals relating to the initiatives. During the third and fourth quarters of 2014, the Company incurred significant restructuring and severance costs related to restructuring activities designed to position the Company for the current and future operating environment and reallocate resources to the Company\u2019s growth initiatives. The reductions in the Company\u2019s workforce from these restructuring activities could cause disruptions to the Company\u2019s operations, and the Company\u2019s anticipated cost savings from the workforce reductions may be less than initially expected. The Company has also launched multi-year enterprise efficiency initiatives to deliver certain business support services (e.g., real estate and certain information technology functions) centrally to the Company\u2019s divisions. In connection with these initiatives, the Company may incur greater than anticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits, experience business disruptions or have difficulty executing the initiatives.\nIf the separation of any of Time Inc., AOL Inc. (\u201cAOL\u201d) or Time Warner Cable Inc. (\u201cTWC\u201d) is determined to be taxable for income tax purposes, Time Warner and/or Time Warner\u2019s shareholders who received shares of Time Inc., AOL or TWC (as applicable) in connection with the respective spin-off of those companies could incur significant income tax liabilities. In connection with the legal and structural separation from the Company of (i) Time Inc. in June 2014 and (ii) AOL in December 2009, Time Warner received an opinion of counsel confirming that the applicable separation transaction should not result in the recognition, for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, of gain or loss to Time Warner or its shareholders, except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares in such transaction. In connection with the legal and structural separation of TWC from the Company in March 2009, Time Warner received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and opinions of counsel confirming that the TWC separation should not result in the recognition, for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, of gain or loss to Time Warner or its shareholders, except to the extent of\nIndex to Financial Statements\ncash received in lieu of fractional shares. The IRS ruling and the opinions of counsel in connection with these transactions were based on, among other things, certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings that were made by Time Warner and Time Inc., AOL or TWC, as applicable, in connection with the applicable separation transaction. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, Time Warner and its shareholders may not be able to rely on the IRS ruling (in the case of the TWC separation transaction) or opinion and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Furthermore, opinions of counsel are not binding on the IRS or state or local tax authorities or the courts, and a tax authority or court could determine that one or more of the separation transactions should be treated as a taxable transaction. Under the tax matters agreement Time Warner entered into with each of Time Inc., AOL and TWC in connection with the respective separation transactions, Time Warner is entitled to indemnification from the applicable former subsidiary for taxes resulting from the failure of the applicable separation transaction to qualify as tax-free as a result of (i) certain actions or failures to act by the former subsidiary or (ii) the failure of certain representations made by the former subsidiary to be true. However, if transaction taxes are incurred for other reasons, Time Warner would not be entitled to indemnification.", "PERMNO": 77418, "SIC": 4888, "TIC": "TWX"}
