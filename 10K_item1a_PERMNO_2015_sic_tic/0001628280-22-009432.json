{"cik": "1770141", "company": "UpHealth, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-04-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. The risk factors summarized below could materially harm the business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations of the Company, impair our future prospects and/or cause\nthe price of our Common Stock to decline. These risk factors are discussed more fully below in the section below. These risk factors are not exhaustive. Material risks that may affect our business, operating results and financial condition include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:\n\u2022Our limited operating history as a combined company makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects;\n\u2022The impact of health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, on our business, financial condition, growth and the actions we may take in response thereto;\n\u2022The high degree of uncertainty of the level of demand for and market utilization of our solutions;\n\u2022Substantial regulation and the potential for unfavorable changes to, or failure by us to comply with, these regulations, which could substantially harm our business and operating results;\n\u2022Our dependency upon third-party service providers for certain technologies;\n\u2022Increases in costs, disruption of supply or shortage of materials, which could harm our business;\n\u2022Developments and projections relating to our competitors and industry;\n\u2022The unavailability, reduction or elimination of government and economic incentives, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022Our management team\u2019s limited experience managing a public company;\n\u2022The possibility of our need to defend ourselves against fines, penalties and injunctions if we are determined to be promoting products for unapproved uses;\n\u2022Concentration of ownership among our existing executive officers, directors and their respective affiliates, which may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions;\n\u2022The lack of assurance that the combined company will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of the NYSE;\n\u2022If the benefits of the Business Combinations do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the market price of the Company\u2019s securities may decline;\n\u2022The risk that the Business Combinations disrupt current plans and operations of our business as a result of the announcement and consummation of the transactions described herein; and\n\u2022Following the consummation of the Business Combinations, the post-combination company\u2019s significant increased expenses and administrative burdens as a public company, which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to UpHealth\u2019s Business and Industry\nOur limited operating history as a combined company and evolving business make it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects and increases the risk of your investment.\nOur limited operating history and rapidly evolving business make it difficult to evaluate our current business, future prospects and plan for growth. UpHealth Holdings began offering products and services as a combined entity late in 2020. UpHealth offers products and services as a combined entity following the consummation of the Business Combinations. We will continue to encounter significant risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing and heavily regulated industries, such as attracting new customers, users and healthcare providers to our platform; retaining customers and encouraging them to utilize new offerings that we make available; competition from other companies; hiring, integrating, training and retaining skilled personnel; verifying the identity of customers, users and credentials of providers serving our customers; developing new solutions; determining prices for our solutions; unforeseen expenses; challenges in forecasting accuracy; and new or adverse regulatory developments affecting the use of digital health, pharmaceutical products, diagnostics, technology platforms or other aspects of the healthcare industry. Additional risks include our ability to effectively manage growth and process, and to store, protect, and use personal data in compliance with governmental regulations, contractual obligations and other legal obligations related to privacy and security. Further, because we depend, in part, on market acceptance of our newer and future services, it is difficult to evaluate trends that may affect our business and whether our expansion will be profitable. If we have difficulty launching new solutions, our reputation may be harmed and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. If our assumptions regarding these and other similar risks and uncertainties that relate to our business, which we use to plan our business, are incorrect or change as we gain more\nexperience operating our platform or expand into the treatment of new conditions, or if we do not address these challenges successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations and our business could suffer.\nIt remains unclear how the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic may impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. This contagious outbreak, which has continued to spread, and the related adverse public health developments, including orders to shelter-in-place, travel restrictions and mandated business closures, have adversely affected workforces, organizations, customers, economies and financial markets globally, leading to an economic downturn and increased market volatility. The duration and severity of this pandemic is unknown and the extent of the business disruption and financial impact depend on factors beyond our knowledge and control making it difficult for us to accurately predict the duration or magnitude of the adverse results of the outbreak and its effects on our business, results of operations or financial condition at this time, but such effects may be material.\nContinued shelter-in-place, quarantine, hospital requisitions, or related measures to combat the spread of COVID-19 or any variants thereof, as well as the perceived need by individuals to continue such practices to avoid infection, among other factors, could harm our results of operations and revenue, business and financial condition. These measures and practices have resulted in temporary closures of some of our offices, the offices and practices of our customers, and may also result in delays in entry into new markets and expansion in existing markets. In addition, customers who utilize our services or products in connection with in-office healthcare procedures, as well as our businesses that provide in-office healthcare procedures, may experience a loss in revenue associated with such measures and practices, potentially negatively impacting their ability or willingness to pay us. In addition, due to the shelter-in-place orders across the globe, several of our businesses have implemented work-from-home policies for many employees which may impact productivity and disrupt our business operations. Generally, we have seen our businesses rebound from an initial negative impact at the start of the pandemic. However, given the unpredictable nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may in the future experience additional negative impacts on our operations, revenues, expenses, collectability of accounts receivables and other money owed, capital expenditures, liquidity and overall financial condition by disrupting or delaying delivery of materials and products in the supply chain for our offices, causing staffing shortages, or increasing capital expenditures due to the need to buy incremental hardware.\nHealthcare organizations around the world have faced and will continue to face, substantial challenges in treating patients with COVID-19, such as the diversion of hospital staff and resources from ordinary functions to the treatment of patients with COVID-19, supply, resource and capital shortages and overburdening of staff and resource capacity. In the United States, governmental authorities have also recommended, and in certain cases required, that elective, specialty and other procedures and appointments, including certain primary care services, be suspended or canceled to avoid non-essential patient exposure to medical environments and potential infection with COVID-19 and to focus limited resources and personnel capacity toward the treatment of patients with COVID-19. These measures may divert patients away from our businesses that provide products and services direct to consumers and from procedures in healthcare facilities that utilize our products and services, which could harm our results of operations and revenue.\nOur continued access to sources of liquidity also depend on multiple factors, including global economic conditions, the condition of global financial markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing and our operating performance. There is no guarantee that debt or equity financing will be available in the future to fund our obligations, or that it will be available on commercially reasonable terms, in which case we may need to seek other sources of funding.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has increased interest in and customer use of digital health solutions. We cannot guarantee that this increased interest or usage will continue after the pandemic has subsided.\nDue to COVID-19, digital health has seen a steep increase in use across the healthcare industry, in part due to governmental waivers of statutory and regulatory restrictions that have historically limited how digital health may be used in delivering care in certain jurisdictions. We do not know if this relaxation of regulatory barriers resulting from COVID-19 will remain or for how long. There is renewed focus on digital health and the expanded use of digital health services and related technology among legislatures and regulators due to COVID-19, which could result in regulatory changes inconsistent with, or that place additional restrictions on, our current business model or operations in certain jurisdictions. If customer adoption of digital health generally, or our platform in particular, materially decreases as COVID-19 restrictions are lifted, or if COVID-19 results in regulatory changes that limit our current activities, our industry, business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nThe level of demand for and market utilization of our solutions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty.\nWith respect to our digital health services, the market for digital health services and related technology is in the early stages of development and characterized by rapid change and volatility. As digital health specialty consultation workflows and related business drivers continue to evolve, the level of demand for and market utilization of our digital health services and platform remain subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of our customers to use, and to increase the frequency and extent of their utilization of, our products and services and our ability to demonstrate the value of digital health to employers, health plans, government agencies and other purchasers of healthcare for beneficiaries in our key digital health markets. If healthcare provider and payer organizations and government agencies and health ministries do not recognize or acknowledge the benefits of our digital health services or software platform or if we are unable to reduce healthcare costs or generate positive health outcomes, then the market for our solutions might not further develop, or it might develop more slowly than we expect. Similarly, negative publicity regarding patient confidentiality and privacy in the context of technology-enabled healthcare or concerns about our solutions or the digital health market as a whole could limit market acceptance of our solutions. If our customers do not perceive the benefits of our solutions, then our market may not develop at all, or it may develop more slowly than we expect. Achieving and maintaining market acceptance of our solutions could be negatively affected by many factors, including:\n\u2022the popularity, pricing and timing of digital health consultation services being launched and distributed by us and our competitors;\n\u2022general economic conditions, particularly economic conditions adversely affecting discretionary and reimbursable healthcare spending;\n\u2022federal and state policy initiatives impacting the need for and pricing of digital health services;\n\u2022changes in customer needs and preferences;\n\u2022the development of specialty care practice standards or industry norms applicable to digital health consultation services;\n\u2022the availability of other forms of medical and digital health assistance;\n\u2022lack of additional evidence or peer-reviewed publication of clinical evidence supporting the safety, ease-of-use, cost-savings or other perceived benefits of our solutions over competitive products or other currently available methodologies;\n\u2022perceived risks associated with the use of our solutions or similar products or technologies generally; and\n\u2022critical reviews and public tastes and preferences, all of which change rapidly and cannot be predicted.\nIn addition, our solutions may be perceived by our customers or potential customers to be more complicated or less effective than traditional approaches, and they may be unwilling to change their current healthcare practices. Healthcare providers are often slow to change their medical treatment practices for a variety of reasons, including perceived liability risks arising from the use of new products and services and the uncertainty of third-party reimbursement. Accordingly, healthcare providers may not recommend our solutions until there is sufficient evidence to convince them to alter their current approach. Any of these factors could adversely affect the demand for and market utilization of our solutions, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely affected by legal challenges to our business model or by actions restricting our ability to provide the full range of our products and services in certain jurisdictions.\nOur ability to conduct digital health services, medical services and pharmacy services in a particular jurisdiction is directly dependent upon the applicable laws governing remote healthcare, the practice of medicine, pharmacy licensure requirements and healthcare delivery in general in such location, which are subject to changing political, regulatory and other influences. With respect to digital health consult services, in the past, state medical boards have established rules or interpreted existing rules in a manner that has limited or restricted the ability to conduct business in accordance with a model utilized in other states or countries. Such actions could result in litigation and the suspension or modification of digital health consult operations in certain states or countries. The extent to which a jurisdiction considers particular actions or relationships to constitute practicing medicine is subject to change and to evolving interpretations by medical boards, state attorneys general and other regulatory or administrative bodies (both domestic and international), among others with broad discretion. Accordingly, we must monitor our compliance with laws in every jurisdiction in which we operate, on an ongoing basis, and we cannot provide assurance that our activities and arrangements, if challenged, will be found to be in compliance with such laws. Additionally, it is possible that the laws and rules governing the practice of medicine, including remote healthcare or pharmacy, in one or more jurisdictions may change in a manner that is detrimental to our business. If a successful legal challenge or an adverse change in the relevant laws\nwere to occur, and we were unable to adapt our business model accordingly, our operations in the affected jurisdictions would be disrupted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn order to support the growth of our business, we may need to seek capital through new equity or debt financings, and such sources of additional capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nThe prior operations of our subsidiary companies consumed substantial amounts of cash since their respective inceptions. We intend to continue to make significant investments to support our business growth, respond to business challenges or opportunities, develop new applications and services, enhance our existing solutions and services, enhance our operating infrastructure and potentially acquire complementary businesses and technologies. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, for all acquired or to be acquired subsidiaries, aggregate net cash (used in) provided by operating activities was $(62.8) million and $2.4 million, respectively.\nOur future capital requirements may be significantly different from our current estimates and will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, both organically and through acquisitions, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new or enhanced services and the continuing market acceptance of digital health. Accordingly, we may need to engage in additional equity or debt financings or collaborative arrangements to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our Common Stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, during times of economic instability, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been difficult for many companies to obtain financing in the public markets or to obtain debt financing, and we may not be able to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing on terms satisfactory to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the implementation and impact of the CARES Act and future stimulus legislation, if any. There can be no assurance as to the total amount and types of assistance we will receive or that we will be able to benefit from provisions intended to increase access resources and ease regulatory burdens for healthcare providers.\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (\u201cCARES\u201d) Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, provides a substantial stimulus and assistance package intended to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including tax relief and government loans, grants and investments. The legislation, as amended, provides for $175 billion in relief funds to hospitals and other healthcare providers on the front lines of the coronavirus response to support healthcare related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID-19 and to ensure uninsured Americans can get testing and treatment for COVID-19. As a result, BHS, a Missouri limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, received payments from the Provider Relief Fund (\u201cPRF\u201d) of $0.2 million in 2020 and in January 2021, another subsidiary, TTC, a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, received PRF proceeds aggregating $0.5 million.\nPayments from the PRF are intended to compensate healthcare providers for lost revenues and incremental healthcare related expenses attributable to coronavirus incurred in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) has stated that PRF payments are not loans and will not need to be repaid. However, as a condition to the receipt of funds, we and any other providers must agree to detailed sets of terms and conditions. HHS has indicated that the terms and conditions may be subject to ongoing changes and reporting. Additionally, HHS has issued a Post-Payment Notice of Reporting Requirements (\u201cReporting Requirements\u201d) that outlines the process under which providers will report their use of payments from the PRF. To the extent HHS modifies the Reporting Requirements and terms and conditions, it may affect our ability to comply and may require the return of funds. As of December 31, 2021, BHS had used $0.1 million of the PRF funds and the remaining $0.1 million is recorded within current portion of long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets as they have not met all of the terms and conditions and restrictions for the CARES Act relative to these funds. As of December 31, 2021, TTC had used all $0.5 million of the PRF funds under the terms and conditions and restrictions for the use of CARES Act PRF. In February 2022, BHS returned the remaining funds of $0.1 million to HHS.\nCertain of our subsidiaries received economic stimulus under the CARES Act. If such funding is not forgiven and is required to be repaid pursuant to the terms of the CARES Act or related guidance, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nSection 1102 of the CARES Act established the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d), which provided additional funding for small businesses, as defined by the Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d), to keep workers employed during the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2020, three of our subsidiaries applied for and received PPP funding from various banks in the aggregate amount of $0.5 million, $1.0 million, and $1.9 million (representing five loan agreements), respectively. Proceeds can only be used for specified covered purposes including payroll, mortgage interest, rent and utilities in accordance with the CARES Act. Each of the PPP loans has a two-year term and bears interest at a rate of 1.0% per annum. To the extent proceeds are used for these covered purposes, some or all of the related principal balances may be forgiven. Each of the subsidiaries spent their respective proceeds on covered purposes. On October 2, 2020, the SBA issued a Procedural Notice with respect to PPP loans and changes of ownership. If required, each of the subsidiaries that borrowed PPP loans has notified or is in the process of notifying the PPP lenders of the change of ownership transaction and has provided the PPP lenders with a copy of the agreements or other documents that effectuated their acquisitions and the Business Combinations. Each subsidiary that borrowed PPP loans has completed the process of their forgiveness applications reflecting their respective use of all of their PPP loan proceeds and submitting the forgiveness applications, together with any supporting documentation, to the PPP lender; and taken other required actions. As of December 31, 2021, all PPP loans were forgiven. The forgiveness of each loan was recognized as a measurement period adjustment to goodwill during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nWe cannot provide assurance that the original principal and interest amounts under the respective PPP loans will be forgiven. If it is determined that any of the subsidiaries that borrowed PPP loans were ineligible to receive their respective PPP loan or determined that any of the subsidiaries that borrowed PPP loans did not comply with requirements after receiving their respective PPP loan, they may be required to repay their respective PPP loan in its entirety and/or be subject to additional penalties (potentially including civil and criminal fines and penalties) and adverse publicity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Additionally, the SBA may audit any PPP loan, as appropriate. Should any of the subsidiaries that borrowed PPP loans be audited or reviewed by federal or state regulatory authorities, such audit or review could result in the diversion of management\u2019s time and attention, generation of negative publicity, the incurrence of additional legal and reputational costs, and potential exposure to civil and criminal liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAs structured, the acquisition of Glocal by UpHealth Holdings did not result in it being wholly-owned by UpHealth Holdings, and it is anticipated that Glocal will have minority owners for some period of time, which may result in higher than expected costs and effort to complete its acquisition.\nThe share purchase agreement that provided for the purchase of equity interests of Glocal (the \u201cGlocal SPA\u201d) provided that UpHealth Holdings is to acquire 90% or more of the equity interests of Glocal, and the acquisition of these equity interests of Glocal is structured to occur in four steps. Under the terms of the Glocal SPA, only the first two of those steps were contemplated to be completed prior to the completion of the Business Combinations.\nThe first step concluded on November 20, 2020, when UpHealth Holdings acquired approximately 43.46% of the outstanding equity of Glocal. The second step consisted of two parts. On March 26, 2021, UpHealth Holdings completed the first of these parts, when it made an investment into Glocal of $3.0 million pursuant to a rights offering by Glocal that was open to all Glocal equity owners. A second payment of $8.7 million was made later to complete the payment for this investment. As a result of this investment, UpHealth Holdings was issued additional shares in Glocal that increased its ownership to approximately 89.4% of the outstanding equity of Glocal. On May 14, 2021, UpHealth Holdings acquired additional shares of Glocal and delivered as acquisition consideration a certain number of UpHealth Holdings shares and a promissory note.\nThe third step towards the Glocal acquisition was completed after the consummation of the Business Combinations. The third step was to transfer additional Glocal shares to UpHealth Holdings, after UpHealth Holdings had sufficient cash and cash equivalents in its accounts to pay the consideration to the selling shareholders of Glocal. UpHealth Holdings has continued to take steps toward completing the acquisition, and now holds approximately 95% of the outstanding equity interests of Glocal. The fourth step has commenced, and pursuant to this step, UpHealth Holdings, as the majority shareholder, will, in conjunction with the remaining Glocal shareholders, take steps to increase its ownership in Glocal to 100% through acquisition of remaining shares from the minority equity holders, issuance of additional shares in Glocal, and/or in any other manner acceptable to UpHealth Holdings and permitted under India law.\nBecause of this multi-step structure for the consummation of the acquisition of ownership interests in Glocal, we anticipate that there will be some minority owners of Glocal, for some period of time. These minority owners have rights to access to books and records of Glocal, and liquidation or dividend rights with respect to the shares of Glocal that they own, but have minimal impact on UpHealth\u2019s ability to control and manage Glocal. The ongoing minority ownership interests in Glocal could result in disputes with the minority holders and in higher than expected costs and efforts to complete the intended acquisition.\nWe may enter into collaborations, joint ventures, strategic alliances or partnerships with third parties that may not result in the development of commercially viable solutions or the generation of significant future revenues.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we may enter into collaborations, joint ventures, strategic alliances, partnerships or other arrangements to develop products and to pursue new markets. Proposing, negotiating and implementing collaborations, joint ventures, strategic alliances or partnerships may be a lengthy and complex process. Other companies, including those with substantially greater financial, marketing, sales, technology or other business resources, may compete with us for these opportunities or arrangements. We may not identify, secure, or complete any such transactions or arrangements in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, on acceptable terms or at all. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction or arrangement. In particular, these collaborations may not result in the development of products that achieve commercial success or result in significant revenues and could be terminated prior to developing any products. Additionally, we may not own, or may jointly own with a third party, the intellectual property rights in products and other works developed under our collaborations, joint ventures, strategic alliances or partnerships.\nAdditionally, we may not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the transaction or arrangement, which could create the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions, and our future collaborators may have economic or business interests or goals that are, or that may become, inconsistent with our business interests or goals. It is possible that conflicts may arise with our collaborators, such as conflicts concerning the achievement of performance milestones, or the interpretation of significant terms under any agreement, such as those related to financial obligations or the ownership or control of intellectual property developed during the collaboration. If any conflicts arise with any future collaborators, they may act in their self-interest, which may be adverse to our best interest, and they may breach their obligations to us. In addition, we may have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that any future collaborators devote to our or their future products. Disputes between us and our collaborators may result in litigation or arbitration which would increase our expenses and divert the attention of our management. Further, these transactions and arrangements will be contractual in nature and will generally be terminable under the terms of the applicable agreements and, in such event, we may not continue to have rights to the products relating to such transaction or arrangement or may need to purchase such rights at a premium.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets and face competition from large, well-established healthcare providers and more traditional retailers and pharmaceutical providers with significant resources, and, as a result, we may not be able to compete effectively. If we are unable to compete effectively, we will not be able to establish our products and services in the marketplace, and as a result, our business may not be profitable.\nThe markets for digital and traditional healthcare are intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product and technological introductions and other market activities of industry participants. We compete directly not only with other established digital health consult providers, ePharmacy, behavioral health, and integrated care management systems solutions, but also traditional healthcare providers, companies providing EHR / health information exchange (\u201cHIE\u201d) services, and pharmacies. Our current competitors include traditional healthcare providers, healthcare providers expanding into the digital health consult market, incumbent digital health consult providers, traditional pharmacies, mail-order and digital pharmacies and specialized software and solution providers that offer similar solutions. Our competitors include enterprise-focused companies that may enter the direct-to-consumer healthcare industry, as well as direct-to-consumer healthcare providers. The surge in interest in digital health, and in particular the relaxation of HIPAA privacy and security requirements, has also attracted new competition from providers who utilize consumer-grade video conferencing platforms. Many of our current and potential competitors may have greater name and brand recognition, longer operating histories and significantly greater resources than we do and may be able to offer products and services similar to those offered on our platform at more attractive prices than we can. We expect competition to intensify in the future as existing competitors and new entrants introduce new digital health services and software platforms or other technology to U.S. healthcare providers, particularly hospitals and healthcare systems. Further, our current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources, which has recently occurred in our industry. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements and may have the ability to initiate or withstand substantial price competition. In addition, our competitors have established, and may in the future establish, cooperative relationships with vendors of complementary products, technologies or services to increase the availability of their solutions in the marketplace.\nNew competitors or alliances may emerge that have greater market share, a larger customer base, more widely adopted proprietary technologies, greater marketing expertise and greater financial resources, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Our competitors could also be better positioned to serve certain segments of our current or future markets, which could create additional price pressure. In light of these factors, even if our offerings are more effective than those of our competitors, current or potential customers may accept competitive solutions in lieu of purchasing from us.\nTo the extent our solutions are perceived by customers and potential customers to be discretionary or otherwise non-essential, our revenues may be disproportionately affected by delays or reductions in general information technology and digital health spending. Moreover, competitors may respond to market conditions by lowering prices and attempting to lure away our customers and/or our customers may develop their own in-house solutions. In addition, the increased pace of consolidation in the healthcare industry may result in reduced overall spending on our solutions.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to distinguish our company and our offerings from our competitors and their products, and includes factors such as:\n\u2022accessibility, ease of use and convenience;\n\u2022price and affordability;\n\u2022personalization;\n\u2022brand recognition;\n\u2022long-term outcomes;\n\u2022breadth and efficacy of offerings;\n\u2022market penetration;\n\u2022marketing resources and effectiveness;\n\u2022partnerships and alliances;\n\u2022relationships with providers, suppliers and partners; and\n\u2022regulatory compliance recourses.\nIf we are unable to successfully compete with existing and potential new competitors, we will not be able to establish our products and services in the marketplace, and as a result, our business may not be profitable. Further, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe depend on our senior management team, and the loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of our key executive officers. Currently these executive officers are at-will employees and therefore they may terminate employment with us at any time with no advance notice. We also rely on our leadership team in the areas of research and development, marketing, services and general and administrative functions. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business. The replacement of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees would likely involve significant time and costs and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives, and our business would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for succession of our executives and senior management. We currently do not have succession plans in place and we have employment arrangements with only a limited number of key executives. These do not guarantee that the services of these or suitable successor executives will continue to be available to us. Further, our failure to retain and motivate our current personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on our ability to recruit, retain and develop a large, highly skilled and diverse workforce. We must evolve our culture in order to successfully grow our business.\nTo continue to execute our growth strategy, we must attract and retain highly skilled personnel. Competition is intense for qualified professionals. We may not be successful in continuing to attract and retain qualified personnel. Our subsidiary companies have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled personnel with appropriate qualifications. The pool of qualified personnel with experience\nworking in the healthcare market is limited overall. In addition, many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than us.\nOur products and services and our operations require a large number of employees all over the world. Our success is dependent on our ability to evolve our culture, align our talent with our business needs, engage our employees and inspire our employees to be open to change, to innovate and to maintain customer-focus when delivering our services. As we expand internationally, we face the challenge of recruiting, integrating, educating, managing, retaining and developing a more culturally diverse workforce\nIn addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in high-technology industries, job candidates often consider the value of the stock options or other equity-based awards they are to receive in connection with their employment. Volatility in the price of our stock may, therefore, adversely affect our ability to attract or retain highly skilled personnel. Further, the requirement to expense stock options and other equity-based compensation may discourage us from granting the size or type of stock option or equity awards that job candidates require to join our company. Failure to attract new personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends, in part, on our continued ability to maintain customer access to a network of qualified healthcare providers, which include medical doctors, physician assistants and nurse practitioners. Failure to maintain such a network could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends, in part, on our continued ability to maintain customer access to a network of qualified healthcare providers, which include medical doctors, physician assistants and nurse practitioners. If we are unable to recruit and retain licensed physicians and other qualified providers to perform services on our platform, or develop and maintain relationships with affiliated professional entities, which we do not own, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and ability to grow and could adversely affect our results of operations. In any particular market, providers could demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs, less attractive service for our customers or difficulty meeting regulatory requirements. Our ability to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with providers also may be negatively impacted by other factors not associated with us, such as pressures on healthcare providers, consolidation activity among hospitals, physician groups and other healthcare providers, changes in the patterns of delivery and payment for healthcare services and any perceived liability risks associated with the use of digital health. The failure to maintain or to secure new cost-effective arrangements that engage the providers on our platform may result in a loss of, or inability to grow, our customer base, higher costs, less attractive service for our customers and/or difficulty in meeting regulatory requirements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to cost-effectively develop widespread brand awareness, our business may suffer.\nWe believe that developing and maintaining widespread awareness of our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread adoption of our products and services and attracting new customers. Our brand promotion activities may not generate customer awareness or increase revenue, and even if they do, any increase in revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, or incur substantial expenses in doing so, we may fail to attract or retain customers necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts or to achieve the widespread brand awareness that is critical for broad customer adoption.\nThe emergence of new technologies may render our digital health technologies and tech-enabled services obsolete or require us to expend significant resources in order to remain competitive.\nThe global healthcare industry is massive, with a number of large market participants with conflicting agendas, and it is subject to significant government regulation and is currently undergoing significant change. Changes in our industry, for example, such as the emergence of new technologies as more competitors enter our market, could result in our digital health solutions being less desirable or relevant.\nIf healthcare benefits trends shift or entirely new technologies are developed that replace existing solutions, our existing or future solutions could be rendered obsolete and our business could be adversely affected. In addition, we may experience difficulties with industry standards, design or marketing that could delay or prevent our development, introduction or implementation of new applications and enhancements.\nRapid technological change in our industry presents us with significant risks and challenges.\nThe global digital health market is characterized by rapid technological change, changing consumer requirements, short product lifecycles and evolving industry standards. Our success will depend on our ability to enhance our products and services with next-generation technologies and to develop or to acquire and market new services to access new consumer populations. There is no guarantee that we will possess the resources, either financial or personnel, for the research, design and development of new applications or services, or that we will be able to utilize these resources successfully and avoid technological or market obsolescence. Further, there can be no assurance that technological advances by one or more of our competitors or future competitors will not result in our present or future applications and services becoming uncompetitive or obsolete.\nNatural or man-made disasters and other similar events may significantly disrupt our business and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur offices may be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including earthquakes, power outages, fires, floods, nuclear disasters and acts of terrorism or other criminal activities, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to operate our business for some period of time. Any disruptions in our operations related to the repair or replacement of our offices, could negatively impact our business and results of operations and harm our reputation. Although we maintain insurance policies covering damage to property we rent, such insurance may not be sufficient to compensate for losses that may occur. Any such losses or damages could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our customers\u2019 facilities may be harmed or rendered inoperable by such natural or man-made disasters, which may cause disruptions, difficulties or material adverse effects on our business.\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition may fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which may result in a decline in our stock price if such fluctuations result in a failure to meet any projections that we may provide or the expectations of securities analysts or investors.\nThe operating results of our six subsidiary company businesses have in the past varied, and our operating results in the future could vary, significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. We may fail to match past performance, our projections or the expectations of securities analysts because of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, we may not be able to accurately forecast our operating results and growth rate. Any of these events could cause the market price of our Common Stock to fluctuate. Factors that may contribute to the variability of our operating results include:\n\u2022the addition or loss of large customers, including through acquisitions or consolidations of such customers;\n\u2022seasonal and other variations in the timing of our sales and implementation cycles, especially in the case of our large customers;\n\u2022travel restrictions, shelter in place orders and other social distancing measures implemented to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, and their respective impact on economic, industry and market conditions, customer spending budgets and our ability to conduct business;\n\u2022the timing of recognition of revenue, including possible delays in the recognition of revenue due to unpredictable implementation timelines;\n\u2022the timing and success of introductions of new products and services by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors, hospital and healthcare system customers or strategic partners;\n\u2022the amount of operating expenses and timing related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;\n\u2022our ability to effectively manage the size and composition of our proprietary network of healthcare professionals relative to the level of demand for services from our customers;\n\u2022customer renewal rates and the timing and terms of such renewals;\n\u2022technical difficulties or interruptions in our services;\n\u2022breaches of information security or privacy;\n\u2022our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel;\n\u2022changes in the structure of healthcare provider and payment systems;\n\u2022changes in the legislative or regulatory environment, including with respect to healthcare, privacy or data protection, or enforcement by government regulators, including fines, orders or consent decrees;\n\u2022the cost and potential outcomes of ongoing or future regulatory investigations or examinations, or of future litigation;\n\u2022political, economic and social instability, including terrorist activities and health epidemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), and any disruption these events may cause to the global economy; and\n\u2022changes in business or macroeconomic conditions.\nThe impact of one or more of the foregoing and other factors may cause our operating results to vary significantly. As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.\nDevelopments affecting spending by the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business.\nThe U.S. healthcare industry has changed significantly in recent years, and we expect that significant changes will continue to occur. General reductions in expenditures by healthcare industry participants could result from, among other things:\n\u2022government regulations or private initiatives that affect the manner in which healthcare providers interact with patients, payors or other healthcare industry participants, including changes in pricing or means of delivery of healthcare products and services;\n\u2022consolidation of healthcare industry participants;\n\u2022federal amendments to, lack of enforcement or development of applicable regulations for, or repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (as amended, the \u201cACA\u201d);\n\u2022reductions in government funding for healthcare; and\n\u2022adverse changes in business or economic conditions affecting healthcare payors, providers or other healthcare industry participants.\nAny of these changes in healthcare spending could adversely affect our revenue. Even if general expenditures by industry participants remain the same or increase, developments in the healthcare industry may result in reduced spending in some or all of the specific market segments that we serve now or in the future. However, the timing and impact of developments in the healthcare industry are difficult to predict. We cannot assure you that the demand for our products and services will continue to exist at current levels or that we will have adequate technical, financial and marketing resources to react to changes in the healthcare industry.\nEconomic uncertainties or prolonged downturns in the general economy, or political changes, could disproportionately affect the demand for our solutions and adversely affect our results of operations.\nCurrent or future economic uncertainties or prolonged downturns, including those caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Negative conditions in the general economy in the United States, including conditions resulting from changes in gross domestic product growth, financial and credit market fluctuations, political deadlock, natural catastrophes, pandemics, social unrest, warfare and terrorist attacks, could cause a decrease in funds available to our customers and potential customers and negatively affect the growth rate of our business.\nThese economic conditions may make it difficult for our customers and us to forecast and plan future budgetary decisions or business activities accurately, and they could cause our customers to reevaluate their decisions to purchase our solutions, which could delay and lengthen our sales cycles or result in cancellations of planned purchases. Furthermore, during challenging economic times or as a result of political changes, our customers may tighten their budgets and face constraints in gaining timely access to sufficient funding or other credit, which could result in an impairment of their ability to make timely payments to us. In turn, we may be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, which would adversely affect our financial results.\nWe cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown, instability or recovery, generally or within the healthcare industry, or the effect of political changes. If the economic conditions of the general economy or the healthcare industry do not improve, or worsen from present levels, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend upon third-party service providers for certain technologies. If these third-party providers fail to fulfill their contractual obligations, fail to maintain or support those technologies or choose to discontinue their services, our business and\noperations could be disrupted, we may be exposed to third party liabilities and our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe depend upon third-party service providers for important functions of our solutions. Software, network applications and data, as well as the core video and audio system integral to our business, are hosted on third-party sites. These facilities may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, cyber security attacks, terrorist attacks, power losses, telecommunications failures, COVID-19 pandemic-related business disruptions and similar events. The occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our ability to provide our services. The facilities also could be subject to break-ins, computer viruses, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct. Redundancies and backup systems are in place to prevent operational disruptions and data loss, but if these technologies fail or are of poor quality, our business, reputation and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Failures or disruption in the delivery of digital health services could result in customer dissatisfaction, disrupt our operations and materially adversely affect operating results. Additionally, we have significantly less control over the technologies third parties provide to us than if we maintained and operated them ourselves. In some cases, functions necessary to some of our solutions may be performed by these third-party technologies. If we need to find an alternative source for performing these functions, we may have to expend significant money, resources and time to develop the alternative, and if this development is not accomplished in a timely manner and without significant disruption to our business, we may be unable to fulfill our obligations to customers. Any errors, failures, interruptions or delays experienced in connection with these third-party technologies and information services or our own systems could negatively impact our relationships with customers and adversely affect our business and could expose us to third-party liabilities.\nOur management team has limited experience managing a public company, and we expect to incur significant costs as we continue to operate as a public company.\nOur management team has limited experience managing a publicly traded company. Their limited experience interacting with public company investors and securities analysts and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies could be a significant disadvantage in that it is likely that an increasing amount of their time may be devoted to these activities, which will result in less time being devoted to the management and growth of our business. These new obligations and constituents require significant attention from our management team and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We will also need to expand our employee base and hire additional employees to support our operations as a public company, which will increase our operating costs in future periods.\nWe expect the rules and regulations applicable to us as a public company to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly The increased costs will decrease our net income or increase our net loss, and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business, including our subsidiaries. For example, our status as a public company makes it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the level of coverage that we believe is appropriate for a public company. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nAdditionally, there continues to be public interest and increased legislative pressure related to environmental, social and governance, or ESG, activities of public companies. For example, there is a growing number of states requiring organizations to report their board composition as well or mandating gender diversity and representation from underrepresented communities, including New York and California. We risk negative stockholder reaction, including from proxy advisory services, as well as damage to our brand and reputation, if we do not act responsibly in a number of key areas, including diversity and inclusion, environmental stewardship, support for local communities, corporate governance and transparency and considering ESG and human capital factors in our operations.\nWe recently acquired a total of six subsidiaries in conjunction with or through the Business Combinations, and we may acquire other companies or technologies, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations, and we may have difficulty successfully integrating any such acquisitions or realizing the anticipated benefits of them, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur subsidiary companies have in the past sought, and we in the future may seek, to acquire or invest in businesses, applications and services or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our solutions, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of\nmanagement and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated.\nIn addition, both with respect to the recent or pending acquisitions of our subsidiaries and additional businesses we may choose to acquire, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired personnel, operations and technologies successfully, or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022management\u2019s lack of experience in acquiring and integrating business;\n\u2022inability to integrate or benefit from acquired technologies or services in a profitable manner;\n\u2022unanticipated costs or liabilities, including legal liabilities, associated with the acquisition;\n\u2022entry into new markets and locations in which we have little operating experience or experience with government rules, regulations and restrictions;\n\u2022difficulty integrating the accounting systems, operations and personnel of the acquired business;\n\u2022difficulties and additional expenses associated with supporting legacy products and hosting infrastructure of the acquired business;\n\u2022difficulty converting the customers of the acquired business onto our platform and contract terms, including disparities in the revenue, licensing, support or professional services model of the acquired company;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022adverse effects to our existing business relationships with business partners and customers as a result of the acquisition;\n\u2022the potential loss of key employees or contractors;\n\u2022use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business; and\n\u2022use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition.\nIn addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of businesses we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our results of operations based on this impairment assessment process, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAcquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nIf we are unable to grow, or if we fail to manage future growth effectively, our revenues may not increase and we may be unable to implement our business strategy.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to grow, and if we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may incur unexpected expenses and be unable to meet our customers\u2019 requirements, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. A key aspect to managing our growth is our ability to scale our capabilities, including in response to unexpected shifts in demand for digital health, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic. To manage our current and anticipated future growth effectively, we must continue to maintain and enhance our IT infrastructure and our financial and accounting systems and controls. We must also attract, train and retain a significant number of qualified healthcare providers, sales and marketing personnel, customer support personnel, professional services personnel, software engineers, technical personnel and management personnel. The availability of such personnel, particularly healthcare providers and software engineers, may be constrained.\nOur growth also depends on the acceptance of our solutions as a suitable supplement to traditional healthcare delivery systems and on our ability to overcome operational challenges. Our business model and solutions could lose their viability as a supplement to traditional healthcare delivery systems due to customer dissatisfaction or new alternative solutions. If we are unable to address the needs of our customers, or our customers are dissatisfied with the quality of our solutions, our customers may not renew their contracts, seek to cancel or terminate their relationship with us or renew on less favorable terms, any of which could cause our annual net dollar retention rate to decrease.\nOur future growth will also depend, in part, on our ability to grow our revenue from existing customers, to complete sales to potential future customers, to expand our customer base, to develop new products and services and to expand internationally. We can provide no assurances that we will be successful in executing on these growth strategies or that, even if our key metrics would indicate future growth, we will continue to grow our revenue or to generate net income. Our ability to execute on our existing sales pipeline, create additional sales pipelines and expand our customer base depends on, among other things, the attractiveness of our services relative to those offered by our competitors, our ability to demonstrate the value of our existing and future services and our ability to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified sales and marketing leadership and support personnel. In addition, our existing customers may be slower to adopt our services than we currently anticipate, which could adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe need to continue to improve our internal systems, processes and controls to effectively manage our operations and growth. We may not be able to successfully implement and scale improvements to our systems and processes in a timely or efficient manner or in a manner that does not negatively affect our operating results. For example, our systems and processes may not prevent or detect all errors, omissions or fraud, including any fraudulent activities conducted or facilitated by our employees or the providers. We may experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems, processes and controls or in connection with third-party software, which could impair our ability to offer our platform to our customers in a timely manner, causing us to lose customers or increase our technical support costs.\nAs we continue to grow, including from the integration of employees and businesses acquired in connection with previous or future acquisitions, we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture, which could negatively affect our profitability and our ability to retain and recruit qualified personnel who are essential for our future success. If we do not effectively manage our growth, we may not be able to execute on our business plan, respond to competitive pressures, take advantage of market opportunities, satisfy client requirements or maintain high-quality solutions. Additionally, we may not be able to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate future growth.\nFailure to effectively manage our growth could also lead us to over-invest or under-invest in development and operations, result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, systems or controls, give rise to operational mistakes, financial losses, loss of productivity or business opportunities and result in loss of employees and reduced productivity of remaining employees. Our growth is expected to require significant marketing and sales investments as well as focused capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects such as the development of new products and services. If we are unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our revenues may not increase or may grow more slowly than expected and we may be unable to implement our business strategy. The quality of our services may also suffer, which could negatively affect our reputation and harm our ability to attract and retain customers.\nCurrent or future litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend.\nWe are subject, and in the future may become subject from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation may result in substantial costs, settlement and judgments and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which may substantially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Insurance may not cover such claims, provide sufficient payments to cover all of the costs to resolve one or more such claims and continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. A claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, thereby leading analysts or potential investors to reduce their expectations of our performance, which could reduce the market price of our Common Stock.\nWe could experience losses or liability not covered by insurance.\nOur business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the provision of digital health and remote, virtual healthcare. If customers or individuals assert liability claims against us, any ensuing litigation, regardless of outcome, could result in a substantial cost to us, divert management\u2019s attention from operations, and decrease market acceptance of our products and services. We attempt to limit our liability to customers by contract; however, the limitations of liability set forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Additionally, we may be subject to claims that are not explicitly covered by contract. We also maintain general liability coverage; however, this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms, may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us, and may include larger self-insured retentions or exclusions for certain products. In addition, the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim. A successful claim not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may become subject to professional liability claims, which could cause us to incur significant expenses, may require us to pay significant damages if not covered by insurance, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business entails the risk of professional liability claims against us and our affiliated professional entities. We and our affiliated professional entities have in the past and may in the future be subject to professional liability claims and, if these claims are successful, substantial damage awards. Although we maintain insurance covering medical malpractice claims in amounts that we believe are appropriate in light of the risks attendant to our business, we cannot predict the outcomes of medical malpractice cases and the effect that any claims of this nature, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have on our business or reputation or on our ability to attract and retain customers. Professional liability insurance is expensive and insurance premiums may increase significantly in the future, particularly as we expand our services. As a result, adequate professional liability insurance may not be available to our providers or to us in the future at acceptable costs or at all.\nAny claims made against us that are not fully covered by insurance could be costly to defend against, result in substantial damage awards against us and divert the attention of our management and our providers from our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any claims may adversely affect our business or reputation.\nWe qualify as an emerging growth company as defined under the JOBS Act as well as a smaller reporting company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies or smaller reporting companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.\nWe qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which the market value of our Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the end of that year\u2019s second fiscal quarter, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1.07 billion or more during such fiscal year (as indexed for inflation), (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in the prior three-year period or (iv) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d). We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act as long as we are an emerging growth company. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have not elected to opt out of such extended transition period and, therefore, we may not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is not an emerging growth company or is an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used.\nAdditionally, we qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (i) the market value of our Common Stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250.0 million as of the end of that year\u2019s second fiscal quarter, or (ii) our annual revenues exceeded $100.0 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our Common Stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the end of that year\u2019s second fiscal quarter. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nAs a publicly traded company following the consummation of the Business Combinations, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of the NYSE. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. As previously disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 when we remained a special purpose acquisition company (\u201cSPAC\u201d), our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2020 due to a material weakness related to not having adequate controls over accounting for complex accounting instruments and, in particular, related to errors in the accounting for warrants issued in connection with UpHealth\u2019s (fka GigCapital2) IPO and recorded in its pre-Business Combinations, historical condensed consolidated financial statements through March 31, 2021. Subsequently, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2021 due to the following material weaknesses:\n\u2022Lack of appropriately designed entity-level controls impacting the control environment and monitoring activities to prevent or detect material misstatements to the consolidated financial statements;\n\u2022Lack of appropriately designed information technology general controls in the areas of user access and segregation of duties, including controls over the recording of journal entries and safeguarding of assets, related to certain information technology systems that support our financial reporting process; and\n\u2022Lack of appropriately designed and implemented controls over the following:\n\u25aaRecording of revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers at certain subsidiaries. Specifically, we had errors in our revenue recognition pertaining to the determination of whether a contract exists, the identification of performance obligations, and the timing and amount of revenue to be recognized;\n\u25aaCompleteness of accruals in the purchase to disbursement process and the payroll process at certain subsidiaries;\n\u25aaSegregation of duties and monitoring controls over the treasury cycle at certain subsidiaries;\n\u25aaFinancial statement close process at certain subsidiaries to ensure the consistent execution, accuracy, and timely review of account reconciliations; and\n\u25aaFinancial statement preparation process that involves the use of a spreadsheet and manually consolidating all subsidiaries.\nWe are also continuing to improve our internal control over financial reporting, and are engaged in the process of the design and implementation of our internal control over financial reporting in a manner commensurate with the scale of our operations post-Business Combinations, which includes hiring additional accounting and financial personnel to implement such processes and controls, enhancing our internal and external technical accounting resource and engaging third party consultants for the formalization of our internal procedures, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act implementation, and a new ERP system. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. Our objective is to complete remediation efforts by the end of 2022. If any of these new or improved controls and systems do not perform as expected, we may experience additional material weaknesses in our controls. Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, additional weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future.\nAny failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be required to include in its periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Common Stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the NYSE. Our predecessor companies were not required to comply with the SEC rules that implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and were therefore not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of control over financial reporting for that purpose. As a public company, we are required to provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting commencing with this Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2021. As discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report, we completed the Business Combinations on June 9, 2021. Prior to the Business Combinations, we were a SPAC formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or other similar Business Combination with one or more target businesses. As a result, the internal controls of UpHealth Holdings became our internal controls and were deemed not comprehensive enough as our operations prior to the Business Combinations were insignificant compared to those of the consolidated entity post-Business Combinations. The design and implementation of internal control over financial reporting post-Business Combinations has required and will continue to require significant time and resources from management and other personnel. Because of this, the design and ongoing development of our framework for implementation and evaluation of internal control over financial reporting is in its preliminary stages. As a result, management was unable, without incurring unreasonable effort or expense, to conduct an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. Accordingly, we are excluding management\u2019s report on internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 215.02 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance\u2019s Regulation S-K Compliance & Disclosure Interpretations. See Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, of this Annual Report for more information. Our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act or a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could cause a decline in the price of our Common Stock.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, the price of our Common Stock may be adversely affected.\nAs noted above, we previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, the disclosure of which may have an adverse impact on the price of our Common Stock. We are required to establish and maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting. Failure to establish those controls, or any failure of those controls once established, could adversely affect our public disclosures regarding our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, management\u2019s assessment of internal control over financial reporting may identify additional weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting, or other matters that may raise concerns for investors. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting, or disclosure of management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, may have an adverse impact on the price of our Common Stock.\nChanges in financial accounting standards may adversely affect our reported results of operations.\nA change in accounting standards or practices could adversely affect our operating results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. For example, in February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), and subsequently issued several supplemental/clarifying ASUs. Among other things, under this ASU, lessees will be required to recognize, at commencement date, a lease liability representing the lessee\u2019s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease and a right-of-use asset representing the lessee\u2019s right to use or control the use of a specified asset for the lease term for leases greater than 12 months. Topic 842 will be effective for UpHealth for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. Accordingly, we will adopt Topic 842 for our annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2022, and interim reporting periods within the annual reporting period\nbeginning January 1, 2023. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this new lease standard on our consolidated financial statements. These and other changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our operating results. In addition, any difficulties in implementing this new revenue standard could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could result in regulatory discipline and harm investors\u2019 confidence in us.\nHealthcare provider licensing and credentialing, a cost of providing professional services, can negatively impact our margins as we may incur increased expenses to utilize appropriately licensed and credentialed healthcare providers for consult demands, especially when expanding to new jurisdictions and new hospital customers.\nA healthcare provider\u2019s ability to perform digital health consults is dictated by where the healthcare provider is licensed to practice and with whom the healthcare provider is privileged to provide services. Governmental licensure and healthcare provider credentialing requirements take time to procure, often necessitating months of lead-time before a healthcare provider is able to practice in a particular jurisdiction or take consults for a particular hospital facility. Our ability to manage and anticipate healthcare provider need and prioritize licensing and credentialing could impact profit margins and expense management. As consult demands increase in areas where only a limited number of healthcare providers hold necessary licenses and credentials, those healthcare providers with appropriate licensing and credentialing to meet customer demands may assume additional overtime shifts or otherwise demand increased fees, thereby increasing our costs. Further, obtaining a license to practice medicine in a particular jurisdiction is at the discretion of the local state medical board or applicable international licensing body, and, as such, timing to achieve licensure in certain jurisdictions may be outside our ability to accomplish within expected time frames.\nThe estimates and assumptions on which our financial projections are based may prove to be inaccurate, which may cause our actual results to materially differ from such projections, and which may adversely affect our future profitability, cash flows and market price of our Common Stock.\nUpHealth\u2019s financial projections are dependent on certain estimates and assumptions related to, among other things, growth assumptions that are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, as well as, among other things, matters related specifically to the recent operational performance and anticipated development of our business, and are subject to significant economic, competitive, industry and other uncertainties, and may not be achieved in full, at all, or within projected timeframes. The financial projections also reflect numerous assumptions with respect to general business, economic, market, regulatory and financial conditions and various other factors, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Furthermore, the financial projections do not take into account any circumstances or event occurring after the date they were prepared. The financial projections were not prepared with a view to public disclosure or complying with published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for the preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. UpHealth\u2019s independent auditor has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the financial projections and, accordingly, does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The financial projections were based on historical experience and on various other estimates and assumptions that our management believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they were made. There will be differences between actual and projected financial results, and actual results may be materially greater or materially less than those contained in the financial projections, especially in light of the increased difficulty in making such estimates and assumptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Any material variation between our financial projections and our actual results may adversely affect our future profitability, cash flows and market price of our Common Stock.\nOur executive officers, directors, principal stockholders and their affiliates will have the ability to exercise significant influence over our company and all matters submitted to stockholders for approval.\nOur executive officers, directors and principal stockholders, together with their affiliates and related persons, beneficially own shares of Common Stock representing a significant percentage of our capital stock. As a result, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they would be able to influence our management and affairs and the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any sale, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company on terms that other stockholders may desire. In addition, this concentration of ownership might adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock by:\n\u2022delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of us;\n\u2022impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us; or\n\u2022discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be the sole source of gain for our stockholders.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, under the Glocal Loan Agreement (see Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, of this Annual Report), we are currently restricted from paying cash dividends, and we expect these restrictions to continue in the future. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may continue to preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our Common Stock will be the sole source of gain for our stockholders for the foreseeable future.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nEvolving government regulations may require increased costs or adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn a regulatory climate that is uncertain, our operations may be subject to scrutiny or reinterpretation under various laws and regulations. Healthcare is a highly regulated industry and subject to laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local level as well as evolving industry standards. Telehealth and other remote care delivery models, in particular, have experienced and will continue to experience frequently changing regulations that may differ substantially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, including state by state. Compliance with current and future laws and regulations will likely require significant initial monetary and recurring expenses and could potentially require us to change our practices upon short notice, adding to the potential costs of compliance. These additional monetary expenditures may increase future overhead, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe have identified what we believe are the areas of government regulation that, if changed, would be costly to us. These include: rules governing the practice of medicine by physicians; rules governing the practice of pharmacy; licensure standards for doctors, pharmacists and behavioral health professionals; laws limiting the corporate practice of medicine; fee-splitting, healthcare fraud and abuse laws; third party payor coverage and reimbursement rules; cybersecurity and privacy laws; laws and rules relating to the distinction between independent contractors and employees; prescribing of controlled substances via a remote encounter; fraud and abuse laws addressing financial relationships between healthcare entities and physicians or other referral sources; commercial and governmental payor billing; anti-kickback laws; provisions of free healthcare by the government; and tax and other laws. There could be laws and regulations applicable to our business that we have not identified or that, if changed, may be costly to us, and we cannot predict all the ways in which implementation of such laws and regulations may affect us.\nIn the jurisdictions in which we operate, we believe we are in compliance with all applicable laws, but, these laws and regulations are extremely complex and, in many cases, still evolving. If our operations are found to violate any of the foreign, federal, state or local laws and regulations which govern our activities, we may be subject to litigation, government enforcement actions, and applicable penalties associated with the violation, potentially including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in certain payor programs or curtailment of our operations. Compliance obligations under these various laws are oftentimes detailed and onerous, further contributing to the risk that we could be found to be out of compliance with particular requirements. The risk of being found in violation of these laws and regulations is further increased by the fact that in many cases, these laws have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, particularly with respect to new and emerging technologies and remote delivery of services, and may therefore be open to a variety of interpretations. In the event that we must remedy any compliance violations, we may be required to modify our services and products in a manner that undermines our solution\u2019s attractiveness to our clients or providers or experts, we may become subject to fines or other penalties or, if we determine that the requirements to operate in compliance in such jurisdictions are overly burdensome, we may elect to terminate our operations in such places. In each case, our revenue may decline, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the COVID-19 disease that it causes has evolved into a global pandemic. It is difficult to predict what impact the continued prevalence of COVID-19 will have on our business and resulting operations. At the same time, the U.S. federal and state governments have relaxed certain laws and regulations to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus, including removal of restrictions on the delivery and payment for remote healthcare services and the expansion of the enforcement discretion of the FDA with respect to certain off-label uses of products that may benefit COVID-19 response and prevention efforts. These changes in the law are occurring quickly, are subject to varying\ninterpretations, and are temporary in nature. We are closely following these changes and we are adapting our operations to quickly respond to the needs of our patients and our partners. We may interpret these changes differently than an applicable government regulator and may be subject to audits in the future. To the extent that any of our interpretations are found to be incorrect, we could be subject to enforcement action or overpayment liability. We may also need to quickly revert to past operations in the event that flexibilities resulting from the pandemic are removed and standard requirements are re-imposed. We are unable to predict the extent to which this pandemic will impact our business and operating results, including new information that may emerge concerning the virus and the actions to contain it or to treat COVID-19, among others.\nOther legal, regulatory and commercial policy influences are subjecting our industry to significant changes, and we cannot predict whether new regulations or policies will emerge from U.S. federal or state governments, foreign governments, or third-party payors. Government and commercial payors may, in the future, consider healthcare policies and proposals intended to curb rising healthcare costs, including those that could significantly affect reimbursement for healthcare services. Future significant changes in the healthcare systems in the United States or elsewhere could also have a negative impact on the demand for our current and future services.\nAdditionally, the introduction of new services may require us to comply with additional, yet undetermined, laws and regulations. Compliance may require obtaining appropriate licenses or certificates, increasing our security measures and expending additional resources to monitor developments in applicable rules to ensure compliance. The failure to adequately comply with these future laws and regulations may delay or possibly prevent some of our products or services from being offered to customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory and other influences. Existing and new laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry could create unexpected liabilities for us, cause us to incur additional costs and restrict our operations. Many healthcare laws are complex, and their application to specific products and services may not be clear. In particular, many existing healthcare laws and regulations, when enacted, did not anticipate the services that we provide. However, these laws and regulations may nonetheless be applied to our business. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations, or other failure to comply, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity and materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the U.S., we conduct business in a heavily regulated industry and if we fail to comply with these laws and government regulations, we could incur substantial penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations or experience enforcement actions or adverse publicity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. healthcare industry is heavily regulated and closely scrutinized by federal, state and local governments. Comprehensive statutes and regulations govern the manner in which we provide and bill for services and collect reimbursement from governmental programs and private payers, our contractual relationships with our providers, vendors and customers, our marketing activities and other aspects of our operations. Of particular importance are:\n\u2022the federal physician self-referral law, commonly referred to as the Stark Law, that, subject to limited exceptions, prohibits physicians from referring Medicare patients to an entity for the provision of certain \u201cdesignated health services\u201d if the physician or a member of such physician\u2019s immediate family has a direct or indirect financial relationship (including an ownership interest or a compensation arrangement) with the entity, and prohibits the entity from billing Medicare for such designated health services;\n\u2022the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which is an intent-based federal criminal statute that prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, provision, solicitation or receipt of any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, for referring an individual, in return for ordering, leasing, purchasing or recommending or arranging for or to induce the referral of an individual or the ordering, purchasing or leasing of items or services covered, in whole or in part, by any federal healthcare program, such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act;\n\u2022the criminal healthcare fraud provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, which we collectively refer to as HIPAA, and related rules that prohibit knowingly and\nwillfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program or to obtain by means of false, or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;\n\u2022the federal False Claims Act that imposes civil liability, including through qui tam and civil whistleblower actions, against individuals or entities that knowingly present, or cause to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement or record material to the payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u2022the federal criminal statute on false statements relating to health care matters, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services;\n\u2022The Civil Monetary Penalties Law authorizes the imposition of civil monetary penalties, assessments and exclusion against an individual or entity based on a variety of prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that the individual or entity knows or should know are for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent;\n\u2022offering remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the individual or entity knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order or receive health care items or services from a particular provider or supplier;\n\u2022employing or contracting with an entity or individual excluded from participation in the federal health care programs;\n\u2022violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute;\n\u2022making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim for payment for items and services furnished under a federal health care program;\n\u2022making, using or causing to be made any false statement, omission or misrepresentation of a material fact in any application, bid or contract to participate or enroll as a provider of services or a supplier under a federal health care program;\n\u2022failing to timely report and return an overpayment owed to the federal government;\n\u2022substantial civil monetary penalties may be imposed under the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law and may vary depending on the underlying violation. In addition, an assessment of not more than three times the total amount claimed for each item or service may also apply and a violator may be subject to exclusion from federal and state health care programs;\n\u2022the federal Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018 (\u201cEKRA\u201d), included as part of the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (\u201cSUPPORT\u201d) for Patients and Communities Act (the \u201cSUPPORT Act\u201d), was signed into law on October 24, 2018. The EKRA provisions, similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, make it a felony for certain entities (including substance abuse treatment centers, clinical treatment facilities and clinical laboratories) to engage in remunerative arrangements that induce or reward individuals or entities for the referral of patients to such facilities, unless an exception applies. EKRA applies regardless of payor source, including for services reimbursed exclusively through commercial insurance or self-paying patients. Violations of EKRA can lead to fines of not more than $200,000 and imprisonment of not more than 10 years, or both, for each occurrence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 220(a);\n\u2022reassignment of payment rules that prohibit certain types of billing and collection practices in connection with claims payable by the Medicare or Medicaid programs;\n\u2022similar state law provisions pertaining to anti-kickback, self-referral, fee-splitting, patient inducement and false claims issues, some of which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any payer, including patients and commercial insurers;\n\u2022state laws that prohibit general business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine, controlling physicians\u2019 medical decisions or engaging in some practices such as splitting fees with physicians;\n\u2022laws that regulate debt collection practices as applied to our debt collection practices;\n\u2022a provision of the Social Security Act that imposes criminal penalties on healthcare providers who fail to disclose or refund known overpayments;\n\u2022federal and state laws that prohibit providers from billing and receiving payment from Medicare and Medicaid for services unless the services are medically necessary, adequately and accurately documented and billed using codes that accurately reflect the type and level of services rendered;\n\u2022federal and state laws and policies related to healthcare providers, licensure, certification, accreditation and related to the Medicare and Medicaid programs enrollment; and\n\u2022federal and state laws and policies related to the practice of pharmacy, pharmacy licensure, and the prescribing and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances.\nIn addition, the healthcare industry is required to comply with additional extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels relating to, among other things:\n\u2022licensure of health providers, certification of organizations and enrollment with government reimbursement programs;\n\u2022necessity and adequacy of medical care;\n\u2022relationships with physicians and other referral sources and referral recipients;\n\u2022billing and coding for services;\n\u2022properly handling overpayments;\n\u2022quality of medical equipment and services;\n\u2022qualifications of medical and support personnel;\n\u2022confidentiality, maintenance, data breach, identity theft and security issues associated with health-related and personal information and medical records; and\n\u2022communications with patients and consumers.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of certain statutory and regulatory exceptions and safe harbors that may be available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Complying with these laws may prove costly. Failure to comply with these laws and other laws can result in civil and criminal penalties such as fines, damages, overpayment, recoupment, imprisonment, loss of enrollment status and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. The risk of us being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are sometimes open to a variety of interpretations. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations to our business or any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements could create liability for us and negatively affect our business. Any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business and result in adverse publicity.\nTo enforce compliance with the federal laws, the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d), have recently increased their scrutiny of healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Telemedicine providers, in particular, have been subject to increased scrutiny by federal and state regulators and have resulted in significant enforcement\nactions. Dealing with investigations can be time- and resource-intensive and can divert management\u2019s attention from the business. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, because of the potential for large monetary exposure under the federal False Claims Act, which provides for treble damages and penalties of $11,665 to $23,331 per false claim or statement for penalties assessed after June 19, 2020, and with respect to violations occurring after November 2, 2015, healthcare providers often resolve allegations without admissions of liability for significant and material amounts to avoid the uncertainty of treble damages that may be awarded in litigation proceedings. Such settlements often contain additional compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree, settlement agreement or corporate integrity agreement. Notably, the government has been using its newly created authority under EKRA to pursue criminal enforcement actions against substance abuse treatment facilities for certain financial arrangements that were not subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute due to the absence of federal healthcare program reimbursement for services rendered by such facilities. EKRA\u2019s statutory exceptions do not strictly mirror the safe harbors available under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and in many instances, relationships that would otherwise comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute would nevertheless violate EKRA. EKRA grants authority to the U.S. Attorney General to promulgate additional exceptions, in consultation with the Secretary of HHS; however, the Attorney General has not yet done so. Notably, the OIG (the agency with authority to promulgate regulatory safe harbors under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute) does not have any authority over EKRA and the Attorney General does not have any particular expertise with healthcare fraud and abuse laws. Given this inexperience, there may be a substantial delay before any additional exceptions to EKRA are implemented. In the meantime, the U.S. Department of Justice is actively pursuing enforcement actions under EKRA. There is much uncertainty in how EKRA will be interpreted and applied and also, whether additional exceptions will be adopted in the future.\nWhile we make every effort to comply with all applicable laws, we cannot rule out the possibility that the government or other third parties could interpret these laws differently and challenge our practices under one or more of these laws. The likelihood of allegations of non-compliance is increased by the fact that under certain federal and state laws applicable to our business, individuals, known as relators, may bring an action on behalf of the government alleging violations of such laws, and potentially be awarded a share of any damages or penalties ultimately awarded to the applicable government body.\nThe laws, regulations and standards governing the provision of healthcare services across the world including India and the U.S. may change significantly in the future. We cannot assure you that any new or changed healthcare laws, regulations or standards will not materially adversely affect our business. Further, we cannot assure you that a review of our business by judicial, law enforcement, regulatory or accreditation authorities will not result in a determination that could adversely affect our operations.\nPatient safety concerns relating to our substance use disorder treatment business could result in increased regulatory burdens, governmental investigations, and negative publicity.\nBecause some of the patients we treat can suffer from severe mental health and chemical dependency disorders, patient incidents, including deaths, assaults and elopements, occur from time to time. If one or more of our substance abuse treatment programs or facilities experiences an adverse patient incident or is otherwise found to have failed to comply with laws and regulations applicable to patient safety or provide appropriate patient care, an admissions hold, loss of accreditation, license revocation or other adverse regulatory action could be taken against the health care providers and programs or facilities involved. Any such patient incident or adverse regulatory action could result in governmental investigations, judgments or fines and have a material adverse effect on a particular program or facility\u2019s continued operation, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we could become the subject of negative publicity, whether warranted or unwarranted, that could have a significant, adverse effect on our reputation of our behavioral health and substance abuse programs and how they are viewed by referral sources and payors.\nThe healthcare industry in India is subject to laws, rules and regulations in the regions where we conduct our business or in which we intend to expand our operations.\nGiven our digital health centers are situated at multiple locations, we are subject to various and extensive local law, rules and regulations relating, among other things, to the setting up and operation of private medical care establishments. Health and safety laws and regulations in India are becoming increasingly stringent in the recent years, and it is possible that they will become significantly more stringent in the future. We may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future laws, rules and regulations. These current or future laws, rules and regulations may also impede our operations. Any non-compliance with the applicable laws, rules and regulations may subject us to regulatory action, including penalties and other civil or criminal proceedings, which may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects and reputation.\nOur international operations pose certain risks to our business that may be different from risks associated with our domestic operations.\nOur international business is subject to risks resulting from differing legal and regulatory requirements, political, social and economic conditions and unforeseeable developments in a variety of jurisdictions. We have one primary office globally and customers across more than nine countries worldwide. Our international operations are subject to particular risks in addition to those faced by our domestic operations, including:\n\u2022uncertain legal and regulatory requirements applicable to digital health, technology services and solutions and prescription medication;\n\u2022multiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as tax laws, privacy and data protection laws and regulations, export and import restrictions, employment laws, regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses;\n\u2022our inability to replicate our domestic business structure consistently outside of the United States, especially as it relates to our contractual arrangement with affiliated professional entities;\n\u2022the need to localize and adapt our solutions for specific countries, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\n\u2022potential loss of proprietary information due to misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than U.S. laws or that may not be adequately enforced;\n\u2022requirements of foreign laws and other governmental controls, including compliance challenges related to the complexity of multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, healthcare, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations;\n\u2022data privacy laws that require that client data be stored and processed in a designated territory;\n\u2022new and different sources of competition and laws and business practices favoring local competitors;\n\u2022local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations;\n\u2022changes to economic sanctions laws and regulations;\n\u2022central bank and other restrictions on our ability to repatriate cash from international subsidiaries;\n\u2022adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates, economic instability and inflationary conditions, which could make our solutions more expensive or increase our costs of doing business in certain countries;\n\u2022limitations on future growth or inability to maintain current levels of revenues from international sales if we do not invest sufficiently in our international operations;\n\u2022different pricing environments, longer sales cycles and longer accounts receivable payment cycles and collections issues;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing, managing and operating our international operations, including difficulties related to administering our stock plans in some foreign countries and increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022difficulties in coordinating the activities of our geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations;\n\u2022natural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism, social or political unrest, including civil unrest, protests, and other public demonstrations, outbreaks of disease, pandemics or epidemics, boycotts, curtailment of trade, and other market restrictions; and\n\u2022regulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over activities subject to regulation under the FCPA, and comparable laws and regulations in other countries.\nOur overall success in international markets depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so without incurring unexpected costs. If we are not able to manage the risks related to our international operations, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur failure to comply with the anti-corruption, trade compliance and economic sanctions laws and regulations of the United States and applicable international jurisdictions could materially adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.\nWe must comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations imposed by governments around the world with jurisdiction over our operations, which may include the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (the \u201cBribery Act\u201d), as well as the laws of the countries where we do business. These laws and regulations apply to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents, and may restrict our operations, trade practices, investment decisions and partnering activities. Where they apply, the FCPA and the Bribery Act prohibit us and our officers, directors, employees and business partners acting on our behalf, including joint venture partners and agents, from corruptly offering, promising, authorizing or providing anything of value to public officials for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. The Bribery Act also prohibits non-governmental \u201ccommercial\u201d bribery and accepting bribes. As part of our business, we may deal with governments and state-owned business enterprises, the employees and representatives of which may be considered public officials for purposes of the FCPA and the Bribery Act.\nWe also are subject to the jurisdiction of various governments and regulatory agencies around the world, which may bring our personnel and agents into contact with public officials responsible for issuing or renewing permits, licenses or approvals or for enforcing other governmental regulations. In addition, some of the international locations in which we will operate lack a developed legal system and have elevated levels of corruption. Our business also must be conducted in compliance with applicable export controls and trade and economic sanctions laws and regulations, including those of the U.S. government, the governments of other countries in which we will operate or conduct business and various multilateral organizations. Such laws and regulations include, without limitation, those administered and enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the United Nations Security Council and other relevant sanctions authorities. Our provision of services to persons located outside the United States may be subject to certain regulatory prohibitions, restrictions or other requirements, including certain licensing or reporting requirements. Our provision of services outside of the United States also exposes us to the risk of violating, or being accused of violating, anti-corruption, exports controls and trade compliance and economic sanctions laws and regulations. Our failure to successfully comply with these laws and regulations may expose us to reputational harm as well as significant sanctions, including criminal fines, imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions and suspension or debarment from government contracts, as well as other remedial measures. Investigations of alleged violations can be expensive and disruptive. Though we have implemented formal training and monitoring programs, we cannot assure compliance by our employees or representatives for which we may be held responsible, and any such violation could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs we expand our international operations, we will increasingly face political, legal and compliance, operational, regulatory, economic and other risks that we do not face or are more significant than in our domestic operations. Our exposure to these risks is expected to increase.\nAs we expand our international operations, we will increasingly face political, legal and compliance, operational, regulatory, economic and other risks that we do not face or that are more significant than in our domestic operations. These risks vary widely by country and include varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and demands, government intervention and censorship, discriminatory regulation, nationalization or expropriation of assets and pricing constraints. Our international products and services need to meet country-specific customer preferences as well as country-specific legal requirements, including those related to licensing, digital health, privacy, data storage, location, protection and security. Our ability to conduct digital health services internationally is subject to the applicable laws governing remote healthcare and the practice of medicine in such location, and the interpretation of these laws is evolving and vary significantly from country to county and are enforced by governmental, judicial and regulatory authorities with broad discretion. We believe we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. We cannot, however, be certain that our interpretation of such laws and regulations is correct in how we structure our operations, our arrangements with physicians, services agreements and customer arrangements.\nOur international operations increase our exposure to, and require us to devote significant management resources to implement controls and systems to comply with the privacy and data protection laws of non-U.S. jurisdictions and the anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws of the United States (including the FCPA) and the United Kingdom (including the Bribery Act) and similar laws in other jurisdictions. Implementing our compliance policies, internal controls and other systems upon our expansion into new countries and geographies may require the investment of considerable management time and financial and other resources over a number of years before any significant revenues or profits are generated. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or employees, restrictions or outright prohibitions on the conduct of our business and significant brand and reputational harm. We must regularly reassess the size, capability and location of our global infrastructure and make appropriate changes, and must have effective change management processes and internal controls in place to address changes in our business and operations. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial position, brand, reputation and/or long-term growth.\nOur international operations require us to overcome logistical and other challenges based on differing languages, cultures, legal and regulatory schemes and time zones. Our international operations encounter labor laws, customs and employee relationships that can be difficult, less flexible than in our domestic operations and expensive to modify or terminate. In some countries we are required to, or choose to, operate with local business partners, which requires us to manage our partner relationships and may reduce our operational flexibility and ability to quickly respond to business challenges.\nOur business is subject to changes in medication pricing and is significantly impacted by pricing structures negotiated by industry participants.\nOur platform aggregates and analyzes pricing data from a number of different sources. The discounted prices that we present through our platform are based in large part upon pricing structures negotiated by industry participants. We do not control the pricing strategies of pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesalers, and pharmacy benefit managers (\u201cPBMs\u201d), each of which is motivated by independent considerations and drivers that are outside our control and has the ability to set or significantly impact market prices for different prescription medications. While we have contractual and non-contractual relationships with certain industry participants, such as PBMs and pharmaceutical manufacturers, these and other industry participants often negotiate complex and multi-party pricing structures, and we have no control over these participants and the policies and strategies that they implement in negotiating these pricing structures.\nPharmaceutical manufacturers generally direct medication pricing by setting medication list prices and offering rebates and discounts for their medications. List prices are impacted by, among other things, market considerations such as the number of competitor medications and availability of alternative treatment options. Wholesalers can impact medication pricing by purchasing medications in bulk from pharmaceutical manufacturers and then reselling such medications to pharmacies. PBMs generally impact medication pricing through their bargaining power, negotiated rebates with pharmaceutical manufacturers and contracts with different pharmacy providers and health insurance companies. PBMs work with pharmacies to determine the negotiated rate that will be paid at the pharmacy by consumers. Medication pricing is also impacted by health insurance companies and the extent to which a health insurance plan provides for, among other things, covered medications, preferred tiers for different medications and high or low deductibles.\nChanges in the fee and pricing structures among industry participants, whether due to regulatory requirements, competitive pressures or otherwise, that reduce or adversely impact fees generated by PBMs would have an adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue and business. Due in part to existing pricing structures, we generate a small portion of our revenue through contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers and other intermediaries. Changes in the roles of industry participants and in general pricing structures, as well as price competition among industry participants, could have an adverse impact on our business. For example, integration of PBMs and pharmacy providers could result in pricing structures whereby such entities would have greater pricing power and flexibility or industry players could implement direct-to-consumer initiatives that could significantly alter existing pricing structures, either of which would have an adverse impact on our ability to present competitive and low prices to consumers and, as a result, the value of our platform for consumers and our results of operations.\nIf reimbursement rates paid by third-party payers are reduced, if third-party payers otherwise restrain our ability to obtain or provide services to patients, or if governments introduce free healthcare provisions or create the provision of significantly different paradigms of delivery service, our business could be negatively impacted.\nPrivate third-party payers pay for the services that we provide through our behavioral digital health consult and on-site division. If any commercial third-party payers reduce their reimbursement rates or elect not to cover some or all of our services, our\nbusiness may be harmed. Third-party payers are also entering into sole source contracts with some healthcare providers, which could effectively limit our pool of potential customers.\nPrivate third-party payers often use plan structures, such as narrow networks or tiered networks, to encourage or require customers to use in-network providers. In-network providers typically provide services through private third-party payers for a negotiated lower rate or other less favorable terms. Private third-party payers generally attempt to limit use of out-of-network providers by requiring customers to pay higher copayment and/or deductible amounts for out-of-network care. Additionally, private third-party payers have become increasingly aggressive in attempting to minimize the use of out-of-network providers by disregarding the assignment of payment from customers to out-of-network providers (i.e., sending payments directly to customers instead of to out-of-network providers), capping out-of-network benefits payable to customers, waiving out-of-pocket payment amounts and initiating litigation against out-of-network providers for interference with contractual relationships, insurance fraud and violation of state licensing and consumer protection laws. If we become out of network for insurers, our behavioral health business could be harmed and our behavioral health patient service revenue could be reduced because customers could stop using our services.\nIf reimbursement rates paid by federal or state healthcare programs are reduced or if government payers otherwise restrain our ability to obtain or provide services to customers, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be harmed.\nA portion of our revenue comes from government healthcare programs, principally Medicare and Tricare. Payments from federal and state government programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations, requirements for utilization review and federal and state funding restrictions, each of which could increase or decrease program payments, as well as affect the cost of providing service to patients. We are unable to predict the effect of recent and future policy changes on our operations. In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon federal and state governments as a result of, among other things, deterioration in general economic conditions and the funding requirements from the federal healthcare reform legislation, may affect the availability of taxpayer funds for Medicare and Medicaid programs. Changes in government healthcare programs may reduce the reimbursement we receive and could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nAs federal healthcare expenditures continue to increase, and state governments continue to face budgetary shortfalls, federal and state governments have made, and continue to make, significant changes in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These changes include reductions in reimbursement levels and new or modified requirements related to Medicaid waivers. Some of these changes have decreased, or could decrease, the amount of money we receive for our services relating to these programs. In some cases, private third-party payers rely on all or portions of Medicare payment systems to determine payment rates. Changes to government healthcare programs that reduce payments under these programs may negatively impact payments from private third-party payers.\nOur pharmacy and behavioral digital health businesses subject us to additional regulations; if we fail to comply, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.\nOur pharmacy business is subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation. Pharmacies, pharmacists and pharmacy technicians are subject to a variety of federal and state statutes and regulations governing various aspects of the pharmacy business, including the distribution of drugs; operation of mail order pharmacies; licensure of facilities and professionals, including pharmacists, technicians and other healthcare professionals; packaging, storing, distributing, shipping and tracking of pharmaceuticals; repackaging of drug products; labeling, medication guides, and other consumer disclosures; interactions with prescribing professionals; compounding of prescription medications; counseling of patients; prescription transfers; advertisement of prescription products and pharmacy services; security; controlled substance inventory control and recordkeeping; and reporting to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, the FDA, state boards of pharmacy, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and other state enforcement or regulatory agencies. Many states have laws and regulations requiring out-of-state mail-order pharmacies to register with that state\u2019s board of pharmacy. In addition, the FDA inspects facilities in connection with procedures to effect recalls of prescription drugs. The Federal Trade Commission also has requirements for mail-order sellers of goods. The U.S. Postal Service has statutory authority to restrict the transmission of drugs and medicines through the mail to a degree that may have an adverse effect on our mail-order operations. The USPS historically has exercised this statutory authority only with respect to controlled substances. If the USPS restricts our ability to deliver drugs through the mail, alternative means of delivery are available to us. However, alternative means of delivery could be significantly more expensive. The U.S. Department of Transportation has regulatory authority to impose restrictions on drugs inserted into the stream of commerce. These regulations generally do not apply to the USPS and its operations. Any failure or\nperceived failure by us to comply with any applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and may expose us to civil and criminal penalties.\nThe pharmacy compounding industry is subject to increased regulatory and customer scrutiny, which may impair sales of compounded medications.\nCompounded prescription medications have not undergone the FDA new drug review and approval process, and limited data, if any, may be available with respect to the safety and efficacy of a compounded medication for any particular indication. In addition, certain compounding pharmacies have been the subject of widespread negative media coverage in recent years, and the actions of these pharmacies have resulted in increased scrutiny of compounding pharmacy activities from the FDA, state boards of pharmacy and other governmental agencies, including through periodic facility inspections and administrative and judicial actions.\nOur growth and future sales of compounded prescription drugs depends not only on our ability to demonstrate the quality and safety of our compounded medications and our compliance with more stringent regulatory standards at the federal and state levels, but also on the continued acceptance of compounded medications in the marketplace.\nIf any pharmacy we own, acquire or build fails to comply with the Controlled Substances Act, or the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFDCA\u201d), such a pharmacy could be required to cease operations or become subject to restrictions that could adversely affect our business.\nPharmacy and controlled substance laws often address the qualification of an applicant\u2019s personnel, the adequacy of its prescription fulfillment and inventory control practices and the adequacy of its facilities, including security controls, and subject pharmacies to oversight by state boards of pharmacy and other regulators that could impose burdensome requirements or restrictions on operations if a pharmacy is found not to comply with these laws. Any such noncompliance could also result in complaints or adverse actions by respective state boards of pharmacy, FDA inspection of the facility to determine compliance with the FDCA, loss of FDCA exemptions provided under Section 503A, warning letters, injunctions, prosecution, fines, loss of required government licenses, certifications and approvals, any of which could involve significant costs and could cause us to be unable to realize the expected benefits of these pharmacies\u2019 operations. Although we ultimately expect to dispense compounded medications through a network of compounding pharmacies, we may not be successful in establishing such a network and the loss of an ability to compound non-sterile formulations would have an adverse impact on our business plan.\nIn particular, pharmaceutical compounding under U.S. federal law is governed by Sections 503A and 503B of the FDCA. Section 503A provides that state-licensed pharmacists and pharmacies are exempt from the provisions of the FDCA requiring human drugs to be approved by FDA prior to marketing, produced in compliance with good manufacturing practices and labeled with adequate directions for use as long as the pharmacy complies with certain other requirements. Among other things, to meet the criteria of Section 503A, a compounded drug must be compounded for an individually identified patient based on a valid prescription. In addition, Section 503A of the FDCA seeks to limit the amount of compounded drugs that a pharmacy can dispense or distribute interstate. Until recently, the interpretation and enforcement of that provision was dependent on the FDA entering into a Memorandum of Understanding (\u201cMOU\u201d), which required sharing of data between FDA and state agencies related to interstate distribution and complaint investigations. However, recently the FDA rescinded the MOU and now, it is anticipated that the interpretation and enforcement of Section 503A will go through a formal rulemaking process. While the rulemaking process is expected to take some time to be completed, if and when it is completed, it may adversely affect the interstate operations of compounding pharmacies and could involve significant additional costs to us in order to sell compounded formulations in certain states.\nIf a compounded drug formulation provided through our compounding services leads to patient injury or death or results in a product recall, we may be exposed to significant liabilities or reputational harm.\nWe could be adversely affected if any of our compounded formulations or similar products sold by other companies, or any products sold by other compounding pharmacies prove to be, or are asserted to be, harmful to patients. In the event of potential or actual patient harm, we may become subject to product recalls and termination or suspension of our state pharmacy licenses. Adverse events, deaths, and product recalls could harm our reputation so that physicians may be unwilling to prescribe our formulations or order any prescriptions from our pharmacies. We may also become subject to product and professional liability lawsuits, or our state pharmacy licenses could be terminated or restricted. If any of these events were to occur, we may be subject to significant litigation or other costs and loss of revenue, and we may be unable to continue our pharmacy operations and further develop and commercialize our proprietary formulations.\nTo the extent any of the components of approved drugs or other ingredients used by any of our acquisitions to produce our compounded formulations have quality or other problems that adversely affect the finished compounded preparations, our business could be adversely affected. Also, because of our dependence upon medical and patient perceptions, any adverse publicity associated with illness or other adverse effects resulting from the use or misuse of our products, any similar products sold by other companies or any products sold by compounding pharmacies could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe may be subject to fines, penalties and injunctions if we are determined to be promoting the use of products for unapproved uses.\nCertain of the products available through our platform require approval by the FDA and are subject to the limitations placed by the FDA on the approved uses in the product prescribing information. Some of these products are prescribed by providers on the platform for \u201coff-label\u201d uses (i.e., for a use other than that specifically authorized by the FDA for the medication in question). While providers are legally permitted to prescribe medications for off-label uses, and although we believe our product promotion is conducted in material compliance with the FDA and other regulations, if the FDA determines that our product promotion constitutes promotion of an unapproved use of an approved product or of an unapproved product, the FDA could request that we modify our product promotion or subject us to regulatory and/or legal enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider the product promotion to constitute promotion of an unapproved use of an approved product or of an unapproved product, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutes, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement.\nIf we fail to comply with federal and state laws and policies governing claim submissions to government healthcare programs or commercial insurance programs, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties or loss of eligibility to participate in government healthcare programs and contractual claims by commercial insurers.\nWe prepare and submit claims for professional services and certain of these claims are governed by federal and state laws with potential civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance. The HIPAA security, privacy and transaction standards also have a potentially significant effect on our integrated care management services, because such services must be structured and provided in a way that supports our customers\u2019 HIPAA compliance obligations. Errors by us or our systems with respect to entry, formatting, preparation or transmission of claim information may be determined or alleged to be in violation of these laws and regulations. If our integrated care management services fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we may be subjected to federal or state government investigations and possible penalties may be imposed upon us, false claims actions may have to be defended, private payers may file claims against us and we may be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid or other government-funded healthcare programs. Further, our customers may seek contractual remedies and indemnification. Any investigation or proceeding related to these topics, even if unwarranted or without merit, could adversely affect demand for our services, could force us to expend significant capital, research and development and other resources to address the failure, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to comply with Medicare and Medicaid regulatory, guidance or policy requirements, we may be subjected to reduced reimbursement, overpayment demands or loss of eligibility to participate in these programs.\nThe Medicare and Medicaid programs are highly regulated, and unique requirements governing the reimbursement of professional services delivered using digital health are evolving and complicated. In addition, changes in government healthcare programs may reduce the reimbursement we receive and could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In particular, there is uncertainty regarding whether temporary waivers of certain Medicare conditions of participation and payment for many virtual care services and temporary expansions of the types of Medicare-covered services that can be provided remotely will continue or be made permanent. If we fail to comply with applicable reimbursement laws and regulations, reimbursement under these programs and participation in these programs could be adversely affected. Federal or state governments may also impose other sanctions on us for failure to comply with the applicable reimbursement regulations, including but not limited to recovering an overpayment. Failure to comply with these or future laws and regulations could limit our ability to provide digital health services to our customers.\nRecent and frequent state legislative and regulatory changes specific to digital health consults may present us with additional requirements and state compliance costs, with potential operational impacts in certain jurisdictions.\nIn recent years, various government agencies, both domestic and international, have adopted an abundance of new legislation and regulations specific to digital health. In some cases, this legislation and regulation, typically targeting \u201cdirect-to-consumer\u201d\ndigital health consult and pharmacy service offerings rather than specialty consultative services, such as our acute digital health solutions, incorporates informed consent, modality, medical record and other requirements. Thus, where new legislation and regulations apply to our digital health solutions, we may incur costs to monitor, evaluate and modify operational processes for compliance. All such activities increase our costs and could, in certain circumstances, impact our ability to make available digital health services in a particular state.\nRisks Related to Privacy, Cybersecurity, Technology and Intellectual Property\nOur proprietary software may not operate properly, which could damage our reputation, give rise to claims against us or divert application of our resources from other purposes, any of which could harm our business.\nOur proprietary technology platform provides customers and patients with the ability to, among other things, register for our services, request a visit (either scheduled or on demand) and communicate and interact with providers, and allows our providers to, among other things, chart patient notes, maintain medical records and conduct visits (via video, phone or the internet). Proprietary software development is time-consuming, expensive and complex, and may involve unforeseen difficulties. We may encounter technical obstacles, and it is possible that we may discover additional problems that prevent our proprietary software from operating properly. We are currently implementing software with respect to a number of new applications and services. If our solutions do not function reliably or fail to achieve member, partner or customer expectations in terms of performance, we may lose or fail to grow customer usage, partners and customers could assert liability claims against us, and partners and customers may attempt to cancel their contracts with us. This could damage our reputation and impair our ability to attract or maintain health network partners and enterprise customers.\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and other matters relating to information collection.\nThere are numerous foreign laws, regulations and directives regarding privacy and the collection, storage, transmission, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d) and other personal or customer data, the scope of which is continually evolving and subject to differing interpretations. We must comply with such laws, regulations and directives and we may be subject to significant consequences, including penalties and fines, for our failure to comply. For example, as of May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d) replaced the Data Protection Directive with respect to the processing of personal data in the European Economic Area (the \u201cEEA\u201d). The GDPR imposes several stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data, including, for example, higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data, more robust disclosures to individuals and a strengthened individual data rights regime, shortened timelines for data breach notifications, limitations on retention and secondary use of information, increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data and additional obligations when we contract with third-party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. The GDPR provides that EU member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of genetic, biometric or health data, which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or could cause our costs to increase and could harm our business and financial condition. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the applicable national data protection laws of the EU member states may result in fines of up to \u20ac20.0 million or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties. To comply with the data protection rules imposed by the GDPR we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance. In addition, privacy laws are developing quickly in other jurisdictions where we operate, which impose similar accountability, transparency and security obligations. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, recent legal developments in Europe have created complexity and compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of information from the EEA to the United States. On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued its ruling in the case of the Irish Data Protection Commissioner v. Facebook Ireland and Maximillian Schrems (Case c-311/18). The ruling invalidated reliance on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield as a lawful means to transfer personal data from the EEA to the United States, while also affirming the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (\u201cSCCs\u201d) as a valid data transfer solution. The Court also held that data exporters and importers may need to employ supplementary measures when using SCCs depending on the nature of the transfer and the laws of the recipient country. After the ruling, the European Data Protection Board issued draft recommendations on the use of supplementary measures. Shortly thereafter, the European Commission issued new draft SCCs.\nWe are analyzing these developments and their impact on our operations. If we are unable to transfer PII between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services or could adversely affect our financial results. Furthermore, any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with or make effective modifications to our policies, or to comply with any federal, state or international privacy, data-retention or data-protection-related laws, regulations,\norders or industry self-regulatory principles could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, a loss of customer confidence, damage to our brand and reputation, and a loss of customers, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, various federal, state and foreign legislative or regulatory bodies may enact new or additional laws and regulations concerning privacy, data-retention and data-protection issues, including laws or regulations mandating disclosure to domestic or international law enforcement bodies, which could adversely impact our business, our brand or our reputation with customers. For example, some countries have adopted laws mandating that PII regarding customers in their country be maintained solely in their country. Having to maintain local data centers and redesign product, service and business operations to limit PII processing to within individual countries could increase our operating costs significantly.\nLike the U.S., India also does not have country level regulations and authorities to control data transfer and management. The most prominent provisions are contained in the Information Technology Act, 2000, that was amended by the Information Technology Amendment Act, 2008. In particular, Section 43A, which addresses \u201creasonable security practices and procedures\u201d is complemented by the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011 (\u201cPersonal Data Protection Rules\u201d). The Personal Data Protection Rules prescribe directions for the collection, disclosure, transfer and protection of sensitive personal data by a company or any person acting on behalf of a company. Further, the Personal Data Protection Rules require every such company to provide a stipulated privacy policy, which is to be published on its website, for dealing with personal information, including sensitive personal data and ensuring security of all personal data collected by it.\nThe India Supreme Court, in a judgment delivered on August 24, 2017, held that the right to privacy is a fundamental right, following which, the Government of India set up a Committee of Experts to examine issues around, and draft a legislation on data-protection in India. The committee submitted its final report and a draft Personal Data Protection Bill to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. The draft of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (\u201cData Protection Bill\u201d) has been introduced before the Lok Sabha on December 11, 2019, which is currently being referred to a joint parliamentary committee by the Parliament. The Data Protection Bill proposes a legal framework governing the processing of personal data, where such data has been collected, disclosed, shared or otherwise processed within India, as well as any processing of personal data by the State, Indian companies, Indian citizens or any person or body of persons incorporated or created under India law. The Data Protection Bill defines personal data and sensitive personal data, prescribes rules for collecting, storing and processing of such data and creates rights and obligations of data-subjects and processors.\nOur use and disclosure of personally identifiable information, including health information, is subject to federal and state privacy and security regulations, and our failure to comply with those regulations or to adequately secure the information we hold could result in significant liability or reputational harm and, in turn, a material adverse effect on our customer base and revenue.\nNumerous state and federal laws and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, privacy, confidentiality, security, availability and integrity of PII, including protected health information (\u201cPHI\u201d). These laws and regulations include HIPAA. HIPAA establishes a set of basic national privacy and security standards for the protection of PHI, by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, referred to as covered entities, and the business associates with whom such covered entities contract for services, which includes us.\nHIPAA requires healthcare providers like us to develop and maintain policies and procedures with respect to PHI that is used or disclosed, including the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. HIPAA also implemented the use of standard transaction code sets and standard identifiers that covered entities must use when submitting or receiving certain electronic healthcare transactions, including activities associated with the billing and collection of healthcare claims.\nHIPAA imposes mandatory penalties for certain violations. Penalties for violations of HIPAA and its implementing regulations start at $119 per violation and are not to exceed $59,522 per violation, subject to a cap of $178,000,000 for violations of the same standard in a single calendar year. However, a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards. HIPAA also authorizes state attorneys general to file suit on behalf of their residents. Courts are able to award damages, costs and attorneys\u2019 fees related to violations of HIPAA in such cases. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to sue us in civil court for violations of HIPAA, its standards have been used as the basis for duty of care in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of PHI.\nIn addition, HIPAA mandates that the Secretary of HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities or business associates for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Standards. It also tasks HHS with establishing a\nmethodology whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the Civil Monetary Penalty fine paid by the violator.\nHIPAA further requires that patients be notified of any unauthorized acquisition, access, use or disclosure of their unsecured PHI that compromises the privacy or security of such information, with certain exceptions related to unintentional or inadvertent use or disclosure by employees or authorized individuals. HIPAA specifies that such notifications must be made \u201cwithout unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach.\u201d If a breach affects 500 patients or more, it must be reported to HHS without unreasonable delay, and HHS will post the name of the breaching entity on its public web site. Breaches affecting 500 patients or more in the same state or jurisdiction must also be reported to the local media. If a breach involves fewer than 500 people, the covered entity must record it in a log and notify HHS at least annually.\nNew health information standards, whether implemented pursuant to HIPAA, congressional action or otherwise, could have a significant effect on the manner in which we must handle healthcare related data, and the cost of complying with standards could be significant. If we do not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to PHI, we could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions.\nIn addition to HIPAA, certain of our operations may be subject to the regulations governing the protection patient records created by federally assisted programs for the treatment of substance use disorder (\u201cSUD\u201d) under 42 CFR Part 2 (the \u201cPart 2 Rule\u201d), implemented by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (\u201cSAMHSA\u201d). The Part 2 Rule requires additional confidentiality obligations related to SUD treatment records and generally speaking, restricts the disclosure of SUD treatment records without patient consent, other than as statutorily authorized in the context of a bona fide medical emergency, or for the purpose of scientific research, audit, or program evaluation, or based on an appropriate court order. On July 15, 2020, SAMHSA issued a final rule on the protection of SUD treatment records under the Part 2 Rule that aims to reduce delays and burdens in care coordination by more closely aligning Part 2 with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, while maintaining certain privacy protections specific to Part 2. This final rule was effective August 14, 2020. Nevertheless, we must ensure that SUD treatment records covered under Part 2 are afforded the additional legal protections mandated by Part 2.\nNumerous other federal and state laws protect the confidentiality, privacy, availability, integrity and security of PII, including PHI. These laws in many cases are more restrictive than, and may not be preempted by, the HIPAA rules and may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and our customers and potentially exposing us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability. For example, the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to alleged privacy and data security violations and certain states have adopted privacy and security standards that a more restrictive than HIPAA and that apply to PII in addition to PHI. For instance, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which came into effect January 1, 2020, was recently amended and expanded by the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d) passed on November 3, 2020. Most of the CPRA\u2019s substantive provisions will not take effect until January 1, 2023, however, the CPRA\u2019s expansion of the \u201cRight to Know\u201d impacts personal information collected on or after January 1, 2022. Companies must still comply with the CCPA during the ramp up period before CPRA goes into effect. The CCPA and CPRA, among other things, create new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provide new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also created a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. It remains unclear what, if any, additional modifications will be made to the CPRA by the California legislature or how it will be interpreted.\nIn addition to the laws discussed above, we may see more stringent state and federal privacy legislation in 2021 and beyond, as the increased cyber-attacks during the pandemic have once again put a spotlight on data privacy and security in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. We cannot predict where new legislation might arise, the scope of such legislation, or the potential impact to our business and operations. This myriad of data privacy and security laws and regulations and the evolving regulatory landscape create complex compliance issues for us and our clients and potentially expose us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability.\nBecause of the extreme sensitivity of the PII we store and transmit, the security features of our technology platform are very important. If our security measures, some of which are managed by third parties, are breached or fail, unauthorized persons may be able to obtain access to sensitive client and customer data, including HIPAA-regulated PHI. As a result, our reputation could be severely damaged, adversely affecting customer and member confidence. Customers may curtail their use of, or stop using, our services or our customer base could decrease, which would cause our business to suffer. In addition, we could face litigation, damages for contract breach, penalties and regulatory actions for violation of HIPAA and other applicable laws or regulations and significant costs for remediation, notification to individuals and for measures to prevent future occurrences. Any potential security breach could also result in increased costs associated with liability for stolen assets or information, repairing system damage that may have been caused by such breaches, incentives offered to customers or other business\npartners in an effort to maintain our business relationships after a breach and implementing measures to prevent future occurrences, including organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees and engaging third-party experts and consultants. While we maintain insurance covering certain security and privacy damages and claim expenses, we may not carry insurance or maintain coverage sufficient to compensate for all liability and in any event, insurance coverage would not address the reputational damage that could result from a security incident.\nWe outsource important aspects of the storage and transmission of client and patient information, and thus rely on third parties to manage functions that have material cybersecurity risks. We attempt to address these risks by requiring outsourcing subcontractors who handle client and customer information to sign business associate agreements contractually requiring those subcontractors to adequately safeguard PHI and PII to the same extent that applies to us and in some cases by requiring such outsourcing subcontractors to undergo third-party security assessments. In addition, we periodically hire third-party security experts to assess and test our security posture. However, we cannot assure you that these contractual measures and other safeguards will adequately protect us from the risks associated with the storage and transmission of customers\u2019 proprietary and protected health information.\nWe also publish statements to our customers that describe how we handle and protect PHI and PII. If federal or state regulatory authorities or private litigants consider any portion of these statements to be untrue, we may be subject to claims of deceptive practices, which could lead to significant liabilities and consequences, including, without limitation, costs of responding to investigations, defending against litigation, settling claims and complying with regulatory or court orders.\nWe also send short message service(\u201cSMS\u201d), text messages to potential end users who are eligible to use our service through certain customers and partners. While we obtain consent from or on behalf of these individuals to send text messages, federal or state regulatory authorities or private litigants may claim that the notices and disclosures we provide, or form of consents we obtain or our SMS texting practices, are not adequate. These SMS texting campaigns are potential sources of risk for class action lawsuits and liability for our company. Numerous class-action suits under federal and state laws have been filed in the past year against companies who conduct SMS texting programs, with many resulting in multi-million-dollar settlements to the plaintiffs. Any future such litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend.\nWe rely on data center providers, Internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, third-party computer hardware and software, other third parties and our own systems for providing services to our customers, and any failure or interruption in the services provided by these third parties or our own systems could expose us to litigation and negatively impact our relationships with customers, adversely affecting our brand and our business.\nWe serve all of our customers leveraging a multi-cloud architecture using four vendors: Armor Defense; AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google. This architecture provides redundancy, cost savings, and reduces our reliance on one single vendor. The actual instances are geographically diverse to insulate our applications from local failures, and have an additional layer of redundancy provided by company managed data centers. While we control and have access to our servers, we do not control the operation of these facilities. The cloud vendors and the owners of our data center facilities have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, or if one of our cloud vendors or data center operators is acquired, we may be required to transfer our servers and other infrastructure to a new vendor or a new data center facility, and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with doing so. Problems faced by our cloud vendors or third-party data center locations with the telecommunications network providers with whom we or they contract or with the systems by which our telecommunications providers allocate capacity among their customers, including us, could adversely affect the experience of our customers. Our cloud vendors or third-party data center operators could decide to close their facilities without adequate notice. In addition, any financial difficulties, such as bankruptcy faced by our cloud vendors or third-party data centers operators or any of the service providers with whom we or they contract may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict.\nAdditionally, if our cloud vendors or data centers are unable to keep up with our growing needs for capacity, this could have an adverse effect on our business. For example, a rapid expansion of our business could affect the service levels at our cloud vendors or data centers or cause such cloud systems or data centers and systems to fail. Any changes in third-party service levels at our cloud vendors or data centers or any disruptions or other performance problems with our products and services could adversely affect our reputation and may damage our customers\u2019 stored files or result in lengthy interruptions in our services. Interruptions in our services may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue refunds to customers for prepaid and unused subscriptions, subject us to potential liability or adversely affect customer renewal rates.\nWe also rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our services, including software from Google, , Microsoft, Apple, Audiocodes, Atlassian, Perforce, PMease and Redhat Corporation, and routers and network equipment from Cisco, Dell, Lenovo and Hewlett-Packard Company. These licenses are generally commercially available on varying terms. However, it is possible that this hardware and software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated. These licenses are generally commercially available on varying terms. However, it is possible that this hardware and software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated.\nOur ability to deliver our internet-based and mobile-application based services depends on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet by third parties. This includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity, bandwidth capacity and security. Our services are designed to operate without interruption. However, we may experience future interruptions and delays in services and availability from time to time. In the event of a catastrophic event with respect to one or more of our systems or those of our service providers, we may experience an extended period of system unavailability, which could negatively impact our relationship with customers, providers, partners, and suppliers.\nWe exercise limited control over third-party vendors, which increases our vulnerability to problems with technology and information services they provide. Interruptions in our network access and services may in connection with third-party technology and information services reduce our revenue, cause us to issue refunds to customers for prepaid and unused subscription services, subject us to potential liability or adversely affect client renewal rates. Although we maintain a security and privacy damages insurance policy, the coverage under our policies may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur related to the services provided by our third-party vendors. In addition, we may not be able to continue to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost, if at all.\nIf our security measures fail or are breached and unauthorized access to a customer\u2019s data is obtained, our services may be perceived as insecure, we may incur significant liabilities, our reputation may be harmed and we could lose sales and customers.\nOur services involve the storage and transmission of customers\u2019 proprietary information, sensitive or confidential data, including valuable intellectual property and personal information of employees, customers and others, as well as the protected health information, or PHI, of our customers. Because of the extreme sensitivity of the information we store and transmit, the security features of our computer, network and communications systems infrastructure are critical to the success of our business. A breach or failure of our security measures, or the security of our data storage vendors, could result from a variety of circumstances and events, including third-party action, employee negligence or error, malfeasance, computer viruses, malicious code (including ransomware), cyber-attacks by computer hackers, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software and databases, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. Information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to further enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. If our or our vendors\u2019 security measures fail or are breached, it could result in unauthorized persons accessing sensitive client data (including PHI), a loss of or damage to our data or an inability to access data sources or process data or provide our services to our customers. There have also been several highly publicized cases in which hackers have requested \u201cransom\u201d payments in exchange for not disclosing customer or other confidential information or for not disabling the target company\u2019s computer or other systems, and we have not been immune to this risk. Such failures or breaches of our security measures, or our inability to effectively resolve such failures or breaches in a timely manner, could severely damage our reputation, adversely affect customer or investor confidence in us, and reduce the demand for our services from existing and potential customers. In addition, we could face litigation, damages for contract breach, monetary penalties or regulatory actions for violation of applicable laws or regulations and incur significant costs for remedial measures to prevent future occurrences and mitigate past violations. Although we maintain insurance covering certain security and privacy damages and claim expenses, we may not carry insurance or maintain coverage sufficient to compensate for all liability and in any event, insurance coverage would not address the reputational damage that could result from a security incident.\nWe may experience cybersecurity and other breach incidents that remain undetected for an extended period. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, or if we are unable to effectively resolve such breaches in a timely manner, the market perception of the\neffectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales, customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, and financial results.\nWe are exposed to data and cybersecurity risks that could result in data breaches, service interruptions, ransomware and demands, harm to our reputation, protracted and costly litigation or significant liability.\nIn connection with the products and services that we provide, we collect, use, store, transmit and otherwise process certain confidential, proprietary and sensitive information, including PII and PHI of customers, employees and others. We rely on the efficient, uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business and securely store, transmit and otherwise process such information. In the normal course of business, we also share information with our service providers and other third parties. A failure to safeguard the integrity, confidentiality, availability and authenticity of personal information, customer data and our proprietary data from cyber-attacks, unauthorized access, fraudulent activity (e.g., check \u201ckiting\u201d or fraud, wire fraud or other dishonest acts), data breaches, ransomware and other security incidents that we, our third-party service providers or our clients may experience may lead to modification, destruction, loss of availability or theft of critical and sensitive data pertaining to us, our clients or other third parties. While we have taken extensive precautions to protect such confidential, proprietary and sensitive information, including personal information, these risks were heightened due to our remote workforce due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and there can be no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber-attacks or security breaches or mitigate all potential risks to our systems, networks and data, particularly with the recent proliferation of ransomware attacks around the world. All such protective measures, as well as additional measures that may be required to comply with rapidly evolving data privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations, have and will continue to cause us to incur substantial expenses. Failure to timely upgrade or maintain computer systems, software and networks as necessary could also make us or our third-party service providers susceptible to breaches and unauthorized access and misuse. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify, investigate or remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from data and cybersecurity risks.\nImproper access to our or our third-party service providers\u2019 systems or databases could result in the theft, publication, deletion or modification of confidential, proprietary or sensitive information, including personal information. An actual or perceived breach of our security systems or those of our third-party service providers may require notification under applicable data privacy regulations or contractual obligations. The accidental or unauthorized access to or disclosure, loss, destruction, disablement, corruption or encryption of, use or misuse of or modification of our, our clients\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 confidential, proprietary or sensitive information, including personal information, by us or our third-party service providers could result in significant fines, penalties, orders, sanctions and proceedings or actions against us by governmental bodies and other regulatory authorities, customers or third parties, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any such proceeding or action, and any related indemnification obligations, could damage our reputation, force us to incur significant expenses in defense of such proceeding or action, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business or result in the imposition of financial liability.\nDespite our efforts to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, availability, and authenticity of our proprietary systems and information, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all cyber threats. No security solution, strategy, or measures can address all possible security threats or block all methods of penetrating a network or otherwise perpetrating a security incident. The risk of unauthorized circumvention of our security measures or those of our third-party providers, clients and partners has been heightened by advances in computer and software capabilities and the increasing sophistication of hackers, including those operating on behalf of nation-state actors, who employ complex techniques involving the theft or misuse of personal and financial information, counterfeiting, \u201cphishing\u201d or social engineering incidents, account takeover attacks, denial or degradation of service attacks, malware, fraudulent payment and identity theft. Because the techniques used by hackers change frequently and are increasingly complex and sophisticated, and new technologies may not be identified until they are launched against a target, we and our third-party service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or detect an incident, assess its severity or impact, react or appropriately respond in a timely manner or implement adequate preventative measures. Our systems are also subject to compromise from internal threats, such as theft, misuse, unauthorized access or other improper actions by employees, service provides and other third parties with otherwise legitimate access to our systems or databases. The latency of a compromise is often measured in months, but could be years, and we may not be able to detect a compromise in a timely manner.\nDue to applicable laws and regulations or contractual obligations, we may also be held responsible for any failure or cybersecurity breaches attributed to our third-party service providers as they relate to the information that we share with them. Although we generally have agreements relating to data privacy and security in place with our third-party service providers, they are limited in nature and we cannot guarantee that such agreements will prevent the accidental or unauthorized access to or\ndisclosure, loss, destruction, disablement, corruption or encryption of, use or misuse of or modification of confidential, proprietary or sensitive information, including personal information, or enable us to obtain reimbursement from third-party service providers in the event we should suffer incidents resulting in accidental or unauthorized access to or disclosure, loss, destruction, disablement or encryption of, use or misuse of or modification of confidential, proprietary or sensitive information, including personal information. In addition, because we do not control our third-party service providers and our ability to monitor their data security is limited, we cannot ensure the security measures they take will be sufficient to protect confidential, proprietary or sensitive information (including personal information).\nRegardless of whether a security incident or act of fraud involving our solutions is attributable to us or our third-party service providers, such an incident could, among other things, result in improper disclosure of information, harm our reputation and brand, reduce the demand for our products and services, lead to loss of client business or confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures, disrupt normal business operations or result in our systems or products and services being unavailable. In addition, such incidents may require us to spend material resources to investigate or correct the incident and to prevent future security incidents, expose us to uninsured liability, increase our risk of regulatory scrutiny, expose us to protracted and costly litigation, trigger indemnity obligations, result in damages for contract breach, divert the attention of management from the operation of our business and otherwise cause us to incur significant costs or liabilities, any of which could affect our financial condition, results of operations and reputation. Moreover, there could be public announcements regarding any such incidents and any steps we take to respond to or remediate such incidents, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these announcements to be negative, it could, among other things, have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. In addition, our remediation efforts may not be successful. Further, any adverse findings in security audits or examinations could result in reputational damage to us, which could reduce the use and acceptance of our solutions, cause our customers to cease doing business with us or have a significant adverse impact on our revenue and future growth prospects. Furthermore, even if not directed at us specifically, attacks on other financial institutions could disrupt the overall functioning of the financial system or lead to additional regulation and oversight by federal and state agencies, which could impose new and costly compliance obligations.\nWe could incur substantial costs as a result of any claim of infringement of another party\u2019s intellectual property rights.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States involving patents and other intellectual property rights. Companies in the Internet and technology industries are increasingly bringing and becoming subject to suits alleging infringement of proprietary rights, particularly patent rights, and our competitors and other third parties may hold patents or have pending patent applications, which could be related to our business.\nThese risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties, which we refer to as non-practicing entities, whose sole primary business is to assert such claims. Regardless of the merits of any intellectual property litigation, we may be required to expend significant management time and financial resources on the defense of such claims, and any adverse outcome of any such claim or the above referenced review could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We expect that we may receive in the future notices that claim we or our customers using our products have misappropriated or misused other parties\u2019 intellectual property rights, particularly as the number of competitors in our market grows and the functionality of applications amongst competitors overlaps. Any future litigation, whether or not successful, could be extremely costly to defend, divert our management\u2019s time, attention and resources, damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business.\nIn addition, in most instances, we have agreed to indemnify our customers against certain third-party claims, which may include claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of such third parties. Our business could be adversely affected by any significant disputes between us and our customers as to the applicability or scope of our indemnification obligations to them. The results of any intellectual property litigation to which we may become a party, or for which we are required to provide indemnification, may require us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022cease offering or using technologies that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022make substantial payments for legal fees, settlement payments or other costs or damages;\n\u2022obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms, to sell or use the relevant technology; or\n\u2022redesign technology to avoid infringement.\nIf we are required to make substantial payments or undertake any of the other actions noted above as a result of any intellectual property infringement claims against us or any obligation to indemnify our customers for such claims, such payments or costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are currently party to, and may enter into future, in-bound intellectual property license agreements. We may not be able to fully protect the intellectual property rights licensed to us or maintain those licenses. Our licensors may retain the right to prosecute and defend the intellectual property rights licensed to us, in which case we would depend on the ability of our licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property protection for the licensed intellectual property. These licensors may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would. In addition, such licenses may only provide us with non-exclusive rights, which could allow other third parties, including our competitors, to utilize the licensed intellectual property rights. Further, our in-bound license agreements may impose various diligence, commercialization, royalty or other obligations on us. Our licensors may allege that we have breached our license agreement with them, and accordingly seek to terminate our license, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects.\nAny failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our technology and our brand.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We rely upon a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as license and access agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Glocal currently has a pending patent application in India and may file for additional patents in India in the future. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information by requiring our employees, consultants and certain of our contractors to execute confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. To the extent that our intellectual property and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected, third parties may gain access to our proprietary information, develop and market solutions similar to ours or use trademarks similar to ours, each of which could materially harm our business. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our products, and policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult and may not be effective. The failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Tax\nCertain U.S. state tax authorities may assert that we have a state nexus and seek to impose state and local income taxes, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe currently operate in all 50 states. There is a risk that certain state tax authorities where we do not currently file a state income tax return could assert that we are liable for state and local income taxes based upon income or gross receipts allocable to such states. States are becoming increasingly aggressive in asserting a nexus for state income tax purposes. We could be subject to state and local taxation, including penalties and interest attributable to prior periods, if a state tax authority successfully asserts that our activities give rise to a nexus. Such tax assessments, penalties and interest may adversely affect our results of operations.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use or similar taxes for digital health services, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe do not collect sales and use and similar taxes in any states for digital health services based on our belief that our services are not subject to such taxes in any state. Sales and use and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly from state to state. Additionally, we do not collect value-added tax or similar taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions based on our belief that our services are not subject to such taxes. Certain states or foreign jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest with respect to past services, and we may be required to collect such taxes for services in the future. Such tax assessments, penalties and interest or future requirements may adversely affect our results of operations.\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions, and our tax liabilities will be subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022expected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;\n\u2022tax effects of stock-based compensation;\n\u2022costs related to intercompany restructurings;\n\u2022changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof; or\n\u2022lower than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates.\nIn addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by taxing authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral Risks Related to the Company\nOur only significant assets are our ownership interests in UpHealth Holdings and Cloudbreak and such ownership may not be sufficient to pay dividends or make distributions or loans to enable us to pay any dividends on our Common Stock or satisfy our other financial obligations.\nWe have no direct operations and no significant assets other than our ownership of UpHealth Holdings and Cloudbreak. We depend on UpHealth Holdings and Cloudbreak for distributions, loans and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations, including our expenses as a publicly traded company and to pay any dividends with respect to our Common Stock. The financial condition and operating requirements of UpHealth Holdings and Cloudbreak may limit our ability to obtain cash from UpHealth Holdings or Cloudbreak. The earnings from, or other available assets of, UpHealth Holdings or Cloudbreak may not be sufficient to pay dividends or make distributions or loans to enable us to pay any dividends on our Common Stock or satisfy our other financial obligations.\nThe ability of UpHealth Holdings or Cloudbreak to make distributions, loans and other payments to us for the purposes described above and for any other purpose may be limited by credit agreements to which UpHealth Holdings or Cloudbreak is party from time to time. Any loans or other extensions of credit to us from UpHealth Holdings or Cloudbreak will be permitted only to the extent there is an applicable exception to the investment covenants under these credit agreements. Similarly, any dividends, distributions or similar payments to us from UpHealth Holdings or Cloudbreak will be permitted only to the extent there is an applicable exception to the dividends and distributions covenants under these credit agreements.\nBecause we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on shares of Common Stock for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your shares of Common Stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nWe may retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion and debt repayment and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends as a public company in the future will be made at the discretion of the Company\u2019s Board and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that the Board may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends may be limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in the Company\u2019s Common Stock unless you sell your Common Stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nThere can be no assurance that UpHealth will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of the NYSE.\nUpHealth\u2019s Common Stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol \u201cUPH\u201d. UpHealth\u2019s continued eligibility for listing may depend on the number of the Company\u2019s shares that are redeemed. If the NYSE delists UpHealth\u2019s shares from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the listing standards, UpHealth and its stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences including:\n\u2022a limited availability of market quotations for UpHealth\u2019s securities;\n\u2022a determination that UpHealth Common Stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in UpHealth Common Stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for shares of UpHealth Common Stock;\n\u2022a limited amount of analyst coverage; and\n\u2022a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe Company may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on its financial condition, results of operations and stock price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nAlthough the Company conducted due diligence on UpHealth Holdings and Cloudbreak in connection with the Business Combinations, the Company cannot assure you that this diligence revealed all material issues that may be present in UpHealth Holdings\u2019 or Cloudbreak\u2019s business, as applicable, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of the Company\u2019s, UpHealth Holdings\u2019 and Cloudbreak\u2019s control will not later arise. As a result, the Company may be forced to write-down or write-off assets in the future, restructure its operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in losses. Even if the Company\u2019s due diligence successfully identified certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with the Company\u2019s preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and may not have an immediate impact on the Company\u2019s liquidity, the fact that the Company reports charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about it or its securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause the Company to be unable to obtain future financing on favorable terms or at all.\nUpHealth incurs significant increased expenses and administrative burdens as a public company, which may have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUpHealth faces increased legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses as a public company that UpHealth Holdings and Cloudbreak did not incur as private companies. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including the requirements of Section 404, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and the rules and regulations promulgated and to be promulgated thereunder, Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the \u201cPCAOB\u201d) and the securities exchanges, impose additional reporting and other obligations on public companies. Compliance with public company requirements increase costs and make certain activities more time-consuming. A number of those requirements require UpHealth to carry out activities that neither UpHealth Holdings nor Cloudbreak did previously. For example, UpHealth has created new board committees and adopted new internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures. In addition, expenses associated with SEC reporting requirements have been, and will continue to be, incurred. Furthermore, if any issues in complying with those requirements are identified (for example, if the auditors or the Company identifies a material weakness or significant deficiency in the internal control over financial reporting), UpHealth could incur additional costs rectifying those issues, and the existence of those issues could adversely affect UpHealth\u2019s reputation or investor perceptions of it. It may also be more expensive to obtain director and officer liability insurance. Risks associated with UpHealth\u2019s status as a public company may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on the UpHealth Board or as executive officers. The additional reporting and other obligations imposed by these rules and regulations will increase legal and financial compliance costs and the costs of related legal, accounting and administrative activities. These increased costs have required, and will continue to require, UpHealth to divert a significant amount of money that could otherwise be used to expand the business and achieve strategic objectives. Advocacy efforts by stockholders and third parties may also prompt additional changes in governance and reporting requirements, which could further increase costs.\nCertain of our warrants are being accounted for as a warrant liability and are being recorded at fair value upon issuance with changes in fair value each period reported in earnings, which may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock.\nIn the private placement of units that occurred concurrently with our IPO, our Founders acquired 567,500 private warrants. The private warrants are exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder\u2019s option, and are non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the private warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the private warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the warrants included in the units sold in the IPO, in which case the 567,500 private warrants could be redeemed by the Company for $5,675. Under GAAP, we are required to evaluate contingent exercise provisions of these\nwarrants and then their settlement provisions to determine whether they should be accounted for as a warrant liability or as equity. Any settlement amount not equal to the difference between the fair value of a fixed number of our equity shares and a fixed monetary amount precludes these warrants from being considered indexed to our own stock, and therefore, from being accounted for as equity. As a result of the provision that the private warrants, when held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, will be redeemable by the Company, the requirements for accounting for these warrants as equity are not satisfied. Therefore, as described in our financial statements included in this Annual Report, we are accounting for these private warrants as a warrant liability and are recording that liability at fair value upon issuance and are recording any subsequent changes in fair value as of the end of each period for which earnings are reported, as we determine based upon a valuation report obtained from our independent third party valuation firm. The impact of changes in fair value on earnings may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to be successful is totally dependent upon the efforts of its key personnel.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to be successful is dependent upon the efforts of the Company. Furthermore, while the Company intends to closely scrutinize any individuals it hires in the future, it cannot assure you that its assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a public company which could cause the Company to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements. This could be expensive and time-consuming and could lead to various regulatory issues which may adversely affect its operations.\nOur stockholders may not be able to enforce judgments entered by U.S. courts against certain of our officers and directors.\nWe are incorporated in the State of Delaware. However, of our directors and executive officers may reside outside of the United States. As a result, stockholders of the Company may not be able to effect service of process upon those persons within the U.S. or enforce against those persons judgments obtained in U.S. courts.\nA market for the Company\u2019s securities may not continue, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of its securities.\nThe price of the Company\u2019s securities may fluctuate significantly due to the market\u2019s reaction to the Company\u2019s financial performance and general market and economic conditions. An active trading market for the Company\u2019s securities may never develop or, if developed, it may not be sustained. In addition, the price of the Company\u2019s securities can vary due to general economic conditions and forecasts, the Company\u2019s general business condition and the release of the Company\u2019s financial reports. Additionally, if the Company\u2019s securities become delisted from the NYSE for any reason, and are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board (an inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities that is not a national securities exchange), the liquidity and price of the Company\u2019s securities may be more limited than if the Company\u2019s securities were quoted or listed on the NYSE or another national securities exchange. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established or sustained.\nIf the Company fails to introduce or acquire new products or services that achieve broad market acceptance on a timely basis, or if its products or services are not adopted as expected, the Company will not be able to compete effectively.\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive, quickly changing environment, and its future success depends on its ability to develop or acquire, and introduce new products and services that achieve broad market acceptance. The Company\u2019s ability to successfully introduce and market new products is unproven. Because the Company has a limited operating history and the market for its products, including newly acquired or developed products, is rapidly evolving, it is difficult to predict the Company\u2019s operating results, particularly with respect to any new products that it may introduce. The Company\u2019s future success will depend in large part upon its ability to identify demand trends in the market in which it will operate and quickly develop or acquire, and design, manufacture and sell, products and services that satisfy these demands in a cost-effective manner.\nIn order to differentiate the Company\u2019s products and services from competitors\u2019 products, the Company will need to increase focus and capital investment in research and development, including software development. If any products currently sold by, and services offered by, the Company do not continue, or if the Company\u2019s new products or services fail to achieve widespread market acceptance, or if we are unsuccessful in capitalizing on opportunities in the market in which the Company will operate, the Company\u2019s future growth may be slowed and its business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Successfully predicting demand trends is difficult, and it is very difficult to predict the effect that introducing a new product or service will have on existing product or service sales. It is possible that the Company may not be\nsuccessful with its new products and services, and as a result the Company\u2019s future growth may be slowed and its business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Also, the Company\u2019s may not be able to respond effectively to new product or service announcements by competitors by quickly introducing competitive products and services.\nIn addition, the Company may acquire companies and technologies in the future. In these circumstances, the combined company may not be able to successfully manage integration of the new product and service lines with the combined company\u2019s existing suite of products and services. If the Company is unable to effectively and successfully further develop these new product and service lines, the post-combination company may not be able to increase or maintain sales, and the Company\u2019s gross margin may be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, the success of the Company\u2019s new products will depend on several factors, including, but not limited to, market demand costs, timely completion and introduction of these products, prompt resolution of any defects or bugs in these products, the Company\u2019s ability to support these products, differentiation of new products from those of the Company\u2019s competitors, market acceptance of these products, delays and quality issues in releasing new products and services. The occurrence of one or more of the foregoing factors may result in lower quarterly revenue than expected, and the Company may in the future experience product or service introductions that fall short of its projected rates of market adoption.\nIf the Company\u2019s products and services fail to achieve and sustain sufficient market acceptance, the combined company\u2019s revenue will be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s success will depend on its ability to develop and market products and services that are recognized and accepted as reliable, enabling and cost-effective. Some potential customers of the combined company may already use products or services similar to what the Company currently offers and similar to what the Company may offer in the future and may be reluctant to replace those products or services with what the Company currently offers or which the combined company may offer in the future. Market acceptance of the Company\u2019s products, services and technology will depend on many factors, including the Company\u2019s ability to convince potential customers that the Company\u2019s products, services and technology are an attractive alternative to existing products, services and technology. Prior to adopting the Company\u2019s products, services and technology, some potential customers may need to devote time and effort to testing and validating the Company\u2019s systems. Any failure of the Company\u2019s systems to meet these customer benchmarks could result in potential customers choosing to retain their existing systems or to purchase systems other than the combined company\u2019s.\nIf the Business Combinations\u2019 benefits do not meet the expectations of investors, stockholders or financial analysts, the market price of the Company\u2019s securities may decline.\nIf the benefits of the Business Combinations do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the market price of the Company\u2019s securities may decline.\nIn addition, fluctuations in the price of the Company\u2019s securities could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment. Any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on your investment in the Company\u2019s securities and the Company\u2019s securities may trade at prices significantly below the price you paid for them. In such circumstances, the trading price of the Company\u2019s securities may not recover and may experience a further decline.\nFactors affecting the trading price of the Company\u2019s securities may include:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in the post-combination company\u2019s quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to the post-combination company;\n\u2022changes in the market\u2019s expectations about the post-combination company\u2019s operating results;\n\u2022success of competitors;\n\u2022the post-combination company\u2019s operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning the post-combination company or the market in general;\n\u2022operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to the post-combination company\u2019s;\n\u2022the post-combination company\u2019s ability to market new and enhanced services and products on a timely basis;\n\u2022changes in laws and regulations affecting the post-combination company\u2019s business;\n\u2022commencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving the Company;\n\u2022changes in the post-combination company\u2019s capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u2022the volume of shares of the post-combination company\u2019s securities available for public sale;\n\u2022any major change in the board or management;\n\u2022sales of substantial amounts of Common Stock by the post-combination company\u2019s directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and\n\u2022general economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.\nBroad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of the Company\u2019s securities irrespective of its operating performance. The stock market in general and the NYSE have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of the Company\u2019s securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for retail stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to the Company could depress the Company\u2019s stock price regardless of the Company\u2019s business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. A decline in the market price of the Company\u2019s securities also could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to issue additional securities and the Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about the Company, its business, or its market, or if they change their recommendations regarding the Company\u2019s securities adversely, the price and trading volume of the Company\u2019s securities could decline.\nThe trading market for the Company\u2019s securities will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about the Company, its business, its market, or its competitors. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on the Company. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of the Company, the Company\u2019s stock price and trading volume would likely be negatively impacted. If any of the analysts who may cover the Company, change their recommendation regarding the Company\u2019s stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about the Company\u2019s competitors, the price of the Company\u2019s securities would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover the Company were to cease coverage of the Company or fail to regularly publish reports on it, the Company could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause its stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThe future sales of shares by existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock in the public market could occur at any time. If the Company\u2019s stockholders sell, or the market perceives that the Company\u2019s stockholders intend to sell, substantial amounts of the Company\u2019s Common Stock in the public market, the market price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock could decline.\nResales of our shares of Common Stock could depress the market price of our Common Stock.\nWe have approximately 144,278,969 shares of Common Stock outstanding at December 31, 2021. The shares held by the Company\u2019s public stockholders are freely tradable. In addition, the Company registered shares of Common Stock issued as merger consideration, and will be registering shares for resales by its officers, directors and other affiliates, as well as shares underlying the warrants and convertible notes issued by the Company, which shares will become available for resale following the expiration of any applicable lockup period (with regard to the merger consideration and the shares held by officers, directors and other affiliates) or the exercise or conversion of the warrants or convertible notes, respectively. Rule 144 will also become available for the resale of shares of our Common Stock that are not registered for resale once one year has elapsed from June\n14, 2021, which is the date that we filed the Current Report on Form 8-K following the closing of the Business Combinations that included the required Form 10 information that reflected that we are no longer a shell company. Such sales of shares of Common Stock or the perception of such sales may depress the market price of our Common Stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. The Company is also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together these provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for the Company\u2019s securities. These provisions include:\n\u2022no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of the Board;\n\u2022the right of our Board to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our Board or the resignation, death or removal of a director in certain circumstances, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board;\n\u2022a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders; and\n\u2022the requirement that a meeting of stockholders may only be called by members of our Board or the stockholders holding a majority of our shares, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of UpHealth or changes in the Board and UpHealth\u2019s management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the DGCL, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding Common Stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our Common Stock. Any provision of the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our Common Stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Common Stock.\nWe are required to comply with certain provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and if we fail to continue to comply, our business could be harmed and our stock price could decline.\nRules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act require an annual assessment of internal control over financial reporting, and for certain issuers an attestation of this assessment by the issuer\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm. The standards that must be met for management to assess the internal control over financial reporting as effective are evolving and complex, and require significant documentation, testing, and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards. We expect to incur significant expenses and to devote resources to Section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis. It is difficult for us to predict how long it will take or costly it will be to complete the assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for each year and to remediate any deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we may not be able to complete the assessment and remediation process on a timely basis. In addition, although attestation requirements by our independent registered public accounting firm are not presently applicable to us we could become subject to these requirements in the future and we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any resulting changes to internal control over financial reporting. In the event that our Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer determine that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under Section 404, we cannot predict how regulators will react or how the market prices of our shares will be affected; however, we believe that there is a risk that investor confidence and share value may be negatively affected.\nOur internal control over financial reporting may not be effective and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness, which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. To comply with the requirements of being a public company, the Company will be required to provide management\u2019s assessment on internal controls commencing with the annual report for fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, and we may need to undertake various actions, such as implementing additional internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff. The standards required for a public company under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are significantly more stringent than those that were required of UpHealth Holdings and Cloudbreak as privately-held companies. Further, as an emerging growth company, our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until the date we are no longer an emerging growth company. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event that it is not satisfied with the level at which the controls of the Company are documented, designed or operating.\nTesting and maintaining these controls can divert our management\u2019s attention from other matters that are important to the operation of our business. If we identify additional material weaknesses in the internal control over financial reporting of the Company or are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 or assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting when we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our Common Stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, investments and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to laws, regulations and rules enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, the Company is required to comply with certain SEC, NYSE and other legal or regulatory requirements, including the NYSE upon the transfer of its listing. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws, regulations and rules may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws, regulations and rules and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and rules, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the sole and exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between the Company and its stockholders, which could limit the Company\u2019s stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers, or employees.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in our name, actions against our directors, officers, and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and, if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder\u2019s counsel except any action (A) as to which the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, (C) for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction, or (D) any action arising under the Securities Act, as to which the Court of Chancery and the federal district courts of the United States of America shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, or employees which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims, although our stockholders will not be\ndeemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. However, there is no assurance that a court would enforce the choice of forum provision contained in our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. If a court were to find such provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that the exclusive forum provision will be applicable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\nThe future exercise of registration rights may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nCertain of our stockholders have registration rights for restricted securities. We are obligated to register certain securities, including all of the shares of Common Stock held by the Initial Stockholders, as well as certain shares of Common Stock held by former securities holders of UpHealth Holdings and Cloudbreak. We are obligated to (i) file a resale \u201cshelf\u201d registration statement to register such securities and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective by the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable after the filing. Sales of a substantial number of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the resale registration statement in the public market could occur at any time the registration statement remains effective. In addition, certain registration rights holders can request underwritten offerings to sell their securities. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our Common Stock.", "PERMNO": 18802, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "GIX"}
