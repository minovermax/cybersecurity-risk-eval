As a result, if we are unable to (i) obtain additional liquidity for working capital, (ii) make the required minimum funding contributions to the defined benefit pension plan and/or (iii) make the required principal and interest payments on the outstanding Notes and Debentures, there would be a significant adverse impact on our financial position and operating results.\nWE HAVE EXPERIENCED OPERATING LOSSES FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO INCREASE OUR REVENUE SUFFICIENTLY TO GENERATE THE CASH REQUIRED TO FUND OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS\nWhile our operations have been improving, we have incurred operating losses for the past several years. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we incurred losses of $1.7 million and $4.6 million, respectively. We are dependent upon future operating performance to generate sufficient cash flows in order to continue to run our businesses. Future operating performance is dependent on general economic conditions, as well as financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. We have experienced a decline in our lease and maintenance bases for the past several years. There can be no assurance that we will be able to increase our revenue sufficiently to generate the cash required to fund our current operations.\nWE HAVE RECEIVED WAIVERS, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, OF THE 2009, 2010 AND 2012 MINIMUM FUNDING STANDARDS FOR OUR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN, WHICH, IF WE FAIL TO FULFILL THE REQUIRED CONDITIONS FOR, MAY RESULT IN THE TERMINATION OF THE PLAN OR REQUIRE US TO MAKE THE UNPAID CONTRIBUTIONS\nIn March 2010, 2011 and 2013, we submitted to the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) requests for waivers of the 2009, 2010 and 2012 minimum funding standards for our defined benefit pension plan. The waiver requests were submitted as a result of the economic climate and the business hardship that we experienced. The 2009, 2010 and 2012 plan year waivers have been approved and granted subject to certain conditions, and deferred payment of $285,000, $559,000 and $669,000 of the minimum funding standard for the 2009, 2010 and 2012 plan years, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we have fully repaid the amounts deferred for the 2009 and 2010 plan years and repaid $395,000 of the 2012 plan year waiver, leaving a balance due related to the waivers of $274,000, which is scheduled to be repaid through 2017. If we do not fulfill the conditions of the waivers, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the \u201cPBGC\u201d) and the IRS have various enforcement remedies that can be implemented to protect the participant\u2019s benefits, such as termination of the plan or a requirement that we make the unpaid contributions. In support of such enforcement remedies, the PBGC has placed a lien on our assets with respect to amounts owed under the plan. Assuming that the remaining waiver payments in 2016 and 2017 are timely paid, the lien on our assets will be released. In 2015, we made the required $1.2 million of contributions to the plan. At this time, we expect to make our required contributions in 2016 of $1.0 million and have already made $197,000 of such contributions, with approximately $813,000 of contributions remaining for 2016; however there is no assurance that we will be able to make any or all of such remaining payments. If we are unable to fulfill our related obligations, the implementation of any such enforcement remedies would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nWE HAVE SIGNIFICANT DEBT, WHICH COULD IMPAIR OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had debt of approximately $1.3 million, $1.0 million of which was reflected under current portion of long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheet. Our ability to satisfy our obligations will be dependent upon our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, including factors beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our long-term debt service requirements or that we will be able to refinance indebtedness at maturity. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nNON-PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON OUTSTANDING NOTES AND DEBENTURES HAS RESULTED IN EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND MAY CONTINUE TO NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BALANCE SHEET\nWe have outstanding $626,000 of Notes which are no longer convertible into common shares. The Notes matured as of March 1, 2012 and are currently in default. The trustee, by notice to us, or the holders of 25% of the principal amount of the Notes outstanding, by notice to us and the trustee, may declare the outstanding principal plus interest due and payable immediately.\nWe have outstanding $334,000 of Debentures. The Debentures matured as of December 1, 2012 and are currently in default. The trustee, by notice to us, or the holders of 25% of the principal amount of the Debentures outstanding, by notice to us and the trustee, may declare the outstanding principal plus interest due and payable immediately.\nCOMPETITORS MAY POSSESS SUPERIOR RESOURCES AND DELIVER MORE MARKETABLE PRODUCTS, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING MARGINS\nOur digital displays compete with a number of competitors, both larger and smaller than us, and with products based on different forms of technology. In addition, there are several competitors whose current products utilize similar technology and who possess the resources to develop competitive and more sophisticated products in the future. Our success is, to some extent, dependent upon our ability to anticipate technological changes in the industry and to successfully identify, obtain, develop and market new products that satisfy evolving industry requirements. There can be no assurance that competitors will not market new products which may have perceived advantages over our products or which, because of pricing strategies, render the products currently sold by us less marketable or would otherwise adversely affect our operating margins.\nOUR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN THE RENEWAL OF EXISTING LEASES OR ENTER INTO NEW LEASES AS OUR CURRENT LEASES EXPIRE, WHICH MAY NOT BE FEASIBLE. THE INABILITY TO RENEW OR REPLACE OUR LEASES WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS\nWe derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from the leasing of our digital displays, generally pursuant to leases that have an average term of one to five years. Consequently, our future success is, at a minimum, dependent on our ability to obtain the renewal of existing leases or to enter into new leases as existing leases expire. We also derive a significant percentage of our revenues from maintenance agreements relating to our digital display products. The average term of such agreements is generally one to five years. A portion of the maintenance agreements are cancelable upon 30 days notice. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining the renewal of existing leases or maintenance agreements, obtaining replacement leases or realizing the value of assets currently under leases that are not renewed. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations.\u201d\nWE ARE DEPENDENT ON OUR PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL\nWe believe that our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jean-Marc Allain, plays a significant role in our success and the loss of his services could have an adverse effect on us. There can be no assurance that we would be able to find a suitable replacement for Mr. Allain. We have an employment agreement with Mr. Allain that expires on February 16, 2018. We believe that in addition to Mr. Allain, there is a core group of executives that also plays a significant role in our success.\nOUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO POTENTIAL FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR AND FOREIGN CURRENCIES, AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, WHICH COULD IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY\nOur financial condition, operating results and future growth could be significantly impacted by risks associated with our international activities, including specifically changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies and international tax rules. Because a significant portion of our business is done in Canada, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar could seriously impact our manufacturing and other costs, as well as overall profitability. The risks to our business related to fluctuations in currency exchange rates is further magnified by the current volatility in the currency markets that are characteristic of financial markets, and currency markets in particular.\nCompliance with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), foreign exchange controls, anti-money laundering and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, labor laws and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions, and may subject us to additional costs which may arise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation. We have not implemented formal policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with all of these laws and regulations. Any such violations could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect our reputation, financial condition or operating results.\nOUR RELIANCE UPON THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURERS IN CHINA COULD SUBJECT US TO POLITICAL AND LEGAL RISKS BEYOND OUR CONTROL\nMany components of our products are produced in China by third-party manufacturers. Our reliance on third-party Chinese manufacturers exposes us to risks that are not in our control, such as unanticipated cost increases or negative fluctuations in currency, which could negatively impact our results of operations and working capital. Any termination of or significant disruption in our relationship with our Chinese suppliers may prevent us from filling customer orders in a timely manner. Given the state of the Chinese political system, we cannot guaranty that our agreements with our Chinese suppliers will remain enforceable pursuant to Chinese law. Furthermore, we cannot guaranty that all rights to payment or performance under our agreements with our Chinese manufacturing partners will be enforceable, and that all debts owing to us, whether in the form of cash or product, will be collectable. While we do not envision any adverse change to our international operations or suppliers, especially given the gradual move towards global integration by the Chinese government and financial markets, adverse changes to these operations as a result of political, governmental, regulatory, economic, exchange rate, labor, logistical or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results.\nSUPPLIERS MAY BE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO FURNISH US WITH REQUIRED COMPONENTS, WHICH MAY DELAY OR REDUCE OUR PRODUCT SHIPMENTS AND NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS\nWe design certain of our products to match components furnished by suppliers. If such suppliers were unable or unwilling to provide us with those components, we would have to contract with other suppliers to obtain replacement sources. In particular, we purchase most of the LEDs and LED module blocks used in our digital displays and lighting from three main suppliers. We do not have long-term supply contracts with these suppliers. A change in suppliers of either LED module blocks or certain other components may result in engineering design changes, as well as delays in obtaining such replacement components. We believe that there are presently other qualified vendors of these components. Our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of certain components as required, or to develop alternative sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable time, could result in delays or reductions in product shipments that could have a materially adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWE CURRENTLY HAVE OUTSTANDING SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK\nWe sold 16,512 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (\u201cPreferred Stock\u201d) in a rights offering that was consummated on November 19, 2015. The Preferred Stock carries a 6.0% cumulative annual dividend, payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 in cash or Common Stock, and is convertible into shares of Common Stock at an initial conversion price of $10.00 per share, representing a conversion ratio of 20 common shares for each share of Preferred Stock held at the time of conversion. Under Delaware law, we may only pay dividends or make a distribution to our stockholders from our surplus (as determined in accordance with Delaware General Corporate Law) or our net profits for the current fiscal year before the dividend or distribution is declared under certain circumstances. Therefore, our ability to pay dividends and make any other distributions in the future will depend upon our financial results, liquidity and financial condition.\nThe shares of Preferred Stock may be subject to mandatory conversion after three years or as early as one year if the closing sale price of our Common Stock has been greater than or equal to $15.00 for 30 consecutive days. The conversion of all or substantially all of Preferred Stock will be dilutive to our Common Stock holders, and if the holders of the Common Stock received upon conversion of Preferred Stock choose to sell all or some of all these shares of Common Stock, the resulting shares could depress the market value of our Common Stock.\nWE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF OUTSTANDING PREFERRED STOCK AND WARRANTS, THE CONVERSION AND EXERCISE OF WHICH WOULD DILUTE THE THEN-EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding Preferred Stock convertible into 330,240 shares of Common Stock and outstanding warrants to purchase 85,333 shares of Common Stock. If all of the outstanding warrants were exercised, the proceeds to us would average $10.68 per share. In addition, over the next three years up to an additional 59,443 shares of Common Stock are potentially issuable as dividends with respect to the Preferred Stock (based on an assumed dividend rate of 6% per annum). We also had 200,000 shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under our stock plans with respect to options or restricted stock that have not been granted. The exercise of all of the outstanding warrants, the conversion of the Preferred Stock into Common Stock, the payment of dividends on the Preferred Stock through the issuance of Common Stock, the grant and exercise of additional options and/or the grant of restricted stock would dilute the then-existing stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership of Common Stock, and any sales in the public market of the Common Stock issuable upon such exercise could adversely affect prevailing market prices for the Common Stock. Moreover, the terms upon which we would be able to obtain additional equity capital could be adversely affected because the holders of such securities can be expected to exercise or convert them at a time when we would, in all likelihood, be able to obtain any needed capital on terms more favorable than those provided by such securities.\nEFFECT OF CERTAIN ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS AND CONTROL BY EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (our \u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d) contains certain provisions that could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of the Company. Such provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock, thus making it less likely that a stockholder will receive a premium on any sale of shares of our Common Stock. Our Board of Directors is divided into three classes, each of which serves for a staggered three-year term, making it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our Board. Our Certificate of Incorporation also contains a provision that requires a four-fifths vote on any merger, consolidation or sale of assets with or to an \u201cInterested Person\u201d or \u201cAcquiring Person.\u201d\nAdditionally, we are authorized to issue 500,000 shares of preferred stock, of which (i) 416,500 are designated as \u201cSeries A Convertible Preferred Stock\u201d, none of which are outstanding, and (ii) 51,000 are designated as Preferred Stock, 16,512 of which are outstanding. The preferred stock contains such rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions as may be fixed by our Board of Directors, which may adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of Common Stock or delay, defer or prevent a change in control of the Company, or discourage bids for the Common Stock at a premium over its market price or otherwise adversely affect the market price of the Common Stock.\nThese provisions and others that could be adopted in the future could deter unsolicited takeovers or delay or prevent changes in our control or management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. These provisions may also limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.\nAs of March 28, 2016, 10 stockholders who are executive officers and/or directors of the Company beneficially own approximately 37.7% of our Common Stock and 2 stockholders who are neither officers nor directors of the Company beneficially own approximately 42.9% of our Common Stock. Accordingly, such stockholders could exert significant control over any potential stockholder actions.\nOUR COMMON STOCK IS QUOTED ON OTC PINK AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIMITED TRADING VOLUME AND PRICE VOLATILITY\nOur Common Stock is quoted on the OTC Pink, an inter-dealer electronic quotation and trading system for equity securities. Quotation of our Common Stock on OTC Pink may limit the liquidity and price of our Common Stock more than if our Common Stock were quoted or listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market or another national exchange. Some investors may perceive our Common Stock to be less attractive because it is traded in the over-the-counter market. In addition, as an OTC Pink company, we do not attract the extensive analyst coverage that accompanies companies listed on national exchanges. Further, institutional and other investors may have investment guidelines that restrict or prohibit investing in securities traded on OTC Pink. These factors may have an adverse impact on the trading and price of our Common Stock.\nOur Common Stock is not widely held and the volume of trading has been relatively low and sporadic. Accordingly, our Common Stock is subject to increased price volatility and reduced liquidity. There can be no assurance that a more active trading market for our Common Stock will develop or be sustained if it does develop. The market price of our Common Stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among other things, the factors described in the sections entitled \u201cSafe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the general state of the securities markets and the market for similar stocks, changes in capital markets that affect the perceived availability of capital to companies in our industry, and governmental legislation or regulation, as well as general economic and market conditions.\nWE ARE DEPENDENT ON A SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had one customer which accounted for 12.5% and 10.8%, respectively, of our total revenue. The loss of this customer, or a significant reduction in revenue from this customer, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.", "PERMNO": 37460, "SIC": 3990, "TIC": "TNLX"}
