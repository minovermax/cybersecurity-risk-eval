{"cik": "1022646", "company": "ULTRA PETROLEUM CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe have filed voluntary petitions for relief under the Bankruptcy Code and are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy cases.\nWe have filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. For the duration of the chapter 11 cases, our business and operations will be subject to various risks, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, file and complete a chapter 11 plan of reorganization, particularly during the exclusivity period (i.e. in general, the period in which we have the exclusive right to file a chapter 11 plan of reorganization);\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain Bankruptcy Court, creditor and regulatory approval of a chapter 11 plan of reorganization in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval with respect to motions in the chapter 11 cases and the outcomes of Bankruptcy Court rulings and of the chapter 11 cases in general;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with third party motions in the chapter 11 cases, which may interfere with our business operations or our ability to propose and/or complete a chapter 11 plan of reorganization;\n\u2022\nincreased costs related to the chapter 11 cases and related litigation;\n\u2022\na loss of, or a disruption in the materials or services received from, suppliers, contractors or service providers with whom we have commercial relationships;\n\u2022\npotential increased difficulty in retaining and motivating our key employees through the process of reorganization, and potential increased difficulty in attracting new employees; and\n\u2022\nsignificant time and effort required to be spent by our senior management in dealing with the bankruptcy and restructuring activities rather than focusing exclusively on business operations.\nWe are also subject to risks and uncertainties with respect to the actions and decisions of creditors and other third parties who have interests in our chapter 11 cases that may be inconsistent with our plans. These risks and uncertainties could affect our business and operations in various ways and may significantly increase the duration of the chapter 11 cases. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with chapter 11 cases, we cannot predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events occurring during the chapter 11 cases may have on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, nor can we predict the ultimate impact that events occurring during the chapter 11 cases may have on our corporate or capital structure.\nWe can make no assurance that there will be any recovery available to investors holding the shares of our existing common stock after the conclusion of our chapter 11 proceedings.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness that is senior to our existing common stock in our capital structure. As a result, the value attributable to shares of our existing common stock will be impacted, possibly materially, by the reorganization of our capital structure through our chapter 11 proceedings. We can make no assurance that there will be any recovery available to investors holding the shares of our existing common stock after the conclusion of our chapter 11 proceedings. Any trading in shares of our common stock during the pendency of the chapter 11 proceedings is highly speculative and poses substantial risks to purchasers of shares of our common stock.\nOperating under Bankruptcy Court protection for a long period of time may harm our business.\nOur future results are dependent upon the successful confirmation and implementation of a plan of reorganization. A long period of operations under Bankruptcy Court protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. So long as the proceedings related to the chapter 11 proceedings continue, our senior management will be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort dealing with the reorganization instead of focusing exclusively on our business operations. A prolonged period of operating under Bankruptcy Court protection also may make it more difficult to retain management and other key personnel necessary to the success and growth of our business. In addition, the longer the proceedings related to the chapter 11 proceedings continue, the more likely it is that our customers and suppliers will lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our businesses successfully and seek to establish alternative commercial relationships.\nIn addition, so long as the chapter 11 proceedings continue, we will be required to incur substantial costs for professional fees and other expenses associated with the administration of the chapter 11 proceeding. The chapter 11 cases may also require us to seek debtor-in-possession financing to fund operations, although we do not plan to obtain debtor-in-possession financing at this time. If we are required to seek but are unable to obtain such financing on favorable terms or at all, our chances of successfully reorganizing our business may be seriously jeopardized, the likelihood that we instead will be required to liquidate our assets may be enhanced, and, as a result, any securities in the debtor could become further devalued or become worthless.\nFurthermore, we cannot predict the ultimate amount of all settlement terms for the liabilities that will be subject to a plan of reorganization. Even once a plan of reorganization is approved and implemented, our operating results may be adversely affected by the possible reluctance of prospective lenders and other counterparties to do business with a company that recently emerged from chapter 11 proceedings.\nWe may not be able to obtain confirmation of a chapter 11 plan of reorganization.\nTo emerge successfully from Bankruptcy Court protection as a viable entity, we must meet certain statutory requirements with respect to adequacy of disclosure with respect to a chapter 11 plan of reorganization (\u201cPlan\u201d), solicit and obtain the requisite acceptances of such a plan and fulfill other statutory conditions for confirmation of such a plan, which have not occurred to date. The confirmation process is subject to numerous, unanticipated potential delays, including a delay in the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s commencement of the confirmation hearing regarding our plan.\nWe may not receive the requisite acceptances of constituencies in the proceedings related to the chapter 11 proceedings to confirm our Plan. Even if the requisite acceptances of our Plan are received, the Bankruptcy Court may not confirm such a plan. The precise requirements and evidentiary showing for confirming a plan, notwithstanding its rejection by one or more impaired classes of claims or equity interests, depends upon a number of factors including, without limitation, the status and seniority of the claims or equity interests in the rejecting class (i.e., secured claims or unsecured claims, subordinated or senior claims, preferred or common stock).\nIf a chapter 11 plan of reorganization is not confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, it is unclear whether we would be able to reorganize our business and what, if anything, holders of claims against us would ultimately receive with respect to their claims.\nEven if a chapter 11 plan of reorganization is consummated, we will continue to face risks.\nEven if a chapter 11 plan of reorganization is consummated, we will continue to face a number of risks, including certain risks that are beyond our control, such as further deterioration or other changes in economic conditions, changes in our industry, potential revaluing of our assets due to chapter 11 proceedings, changes in\nconsumer demand for, and acceptance of, our oil and gas and increasing expenses. Some of these concerns and effects typically become more acute when a case under the Bankruptcy Code continues for a protracted period without indication of how or when the case may be completed. As a result of these risks and others, there is no guaranty that the Plan or any other plan of reorganization will achieve our stated goals.\nIn addition, at the outset of the chapter 11 proceedings, the Bankruptcy Code gives the debtor the exclusive right to file and solicit acceptance of the Plan and prohibits creditors, equity security holders and others from filing or soliciting a plan for a certain period of time. To date, we have retained the exclusive right to propose the Plan and solicit acceptances thereof. If the Bankruptcy Court terminates that right, however, or the exclusivity period expires, there could be a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve confirmation of the Plan in order to achieve our stated goals.\nFurthermore, even if our debts are reduced or discharged through the Plan, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing or other various means to fund our business after the completion of the chapter 11 process. Adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms.\nOur long-term liquidity requirements and the adequacy of our capital resources are difficult to predict at this time.\nWe face uncertainty regarding the adequacy of our liquidity and capital resources and have extremely limited, if any, access to additional financing. In addition to the cash requirements necessary to fund ongoing operations, we have incurred significant professional fees and other costs in connection with preparation for the chapter 11 proceedings and expect that we will continue to incur significant professional fees and costs throughout our chapter 11 proceedings. We cannot assure you that cash on hand and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to continue to fund our operations and allow us to satisfy our obligations related to the chapter 11 proceedings until we are able to emerge from our chapter 11 proceedings.\nOur liquidity, including our ability to meet our ongoing operational obligations, is dependent upon, among other things: (i) our ability to comply with the terms and conditions of any cash collateral order that may be entered by the Bankruptcy Court in connection with the chapter 11 proceedings, (ii) our ability to maintain adequate cash on hand, (iii) our ability to generate cash flow from operations, (iv) our ability to develop, confirm and consummate a chapter 11 plan or other alternative restructuring transaction, and (v) the cost, duration and outcome of the chapter 11 proceedings.\nIn certain instances, a chapter 11 case may be converted to a case under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nUpon a showing of cause, the Bankruptcy Court may convert our chapter 11 case to a case under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In such event, a chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate our assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code. We believe that liquidation under chapter 7 would result in significantly smaller distributions being made to our creditors than those provided for in our Plan because of (i) the likelihood that the assets would have to be sold or otherwise disposed of in a distressed fashion over a short period of time rather than in a controlled manner and as a going concern, (ii) additional administrative expenses involved in the appointment of a chapter 7 trustee, and (iii) additional expenses and claims, some of which would be entitled to priority, that would be generated during the liquidation and from the rejection of leases and other executory contracts in connection with a cessation of operations.\nAs a result of the chapter 11 cases, our historical financial information may be volatile and not be indicative of our future financial performance.\nDuring the chapter 11 proceedings, we expect our financial results to continue to be volatile as asset impairments, asset dispositions, restructuring activities and expenses, contract terminations and rejections, and claims assessments and may significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our historical financial performance may not be indicative of our future financial performance.\nOur capital structure will likely be significantly altered under any chapter 11 plan confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court. Under fresh-start accounting rules that may apply to us upon the effective date of a chapter 11 plan, our assets and liabilities would be adjusted to fair value, which could have a significant impact on our financial statements. Accordingly, if fresh-start accounting rules apply, our financial condition and results of operations following our emergence from chapter 11 would not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in our historical financial statements. In connection with the chapter 11 cases and the development of a chapter 11 plan, it is also possible that additional restructuring and related charges may be identified and recorded in future periods. Such charges could be material to our consolidated financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in the chapter 11 proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bankruptcy Court provides that the confirmation of a plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to confirmation. With few exceptions, all claims that arose prior to April 29, 2016 or before confirmation of the plan of reorganization (i) would be subject to compromise and/or treatment under the plan of reorganization and/or (ii) would be discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the plan of reorganization. Any claims not ultimately discharged through a plan of reorganization could be asserted against the reorganized entities and may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations on a post-reorganization basis.\nTransfers of our equity, or issuances of equity in connection with our chapter 11 proceedings, may impair our ability to utilize our federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards in future years.\nUnder federal income tax law, a corporation is generally permitted to deduct from taxable income net operating losses carried forward from prior years. We have U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2016. Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income and to reduce federal income tax liability is subject to certain requirements and restrictions. If we experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, then our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be substantially limited, which could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations. Generally, there is an \u201cownership change\u201d if one or more shareholders owning 5% or more of a corporation\u2019s common stock have aggregate increases in their ownership of such stock of more than 50 percentage points over the prior three-year period. Following the implementation of a plan of reorganization, it is possible that an \u201cownership change\u201d may be deemed to occur. Under section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, absent an application exception, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the amount of its net operating losses that may be utilized to offset future taxable income generally is subject to an annual limitation on the amount of federal income tax net operating loss carry-forwards existing prior to the change that it could utilize to offset its taxable income in any future taxable year to an amount generally equal to the value of its stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate. Because the value of our stock can fluctuate materially, it is possible an ownership change would materially limit our ability to utilize our substantial federal income tax net operating loss carry-forwards in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to utilize our federal income tax net operating loss carry-forwards to offset future taxable income.\nWe may experience increased levels of employee attrition as a result of the chapter 11 cases.\nAs a result of the chapter 11 cases, we may experience increased levels of employee attrition, and our employees likely will face considerable distraction and uncertainty. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our ability to engage, motivate and retain key employees or take other measures intended to motivate and incent key employees to remain with us through the pendency of the chapter 11 cases is limited by restrictions on implementation of incentive\nprograms under the Bankruptcy Code. The loss of services of members of our senior management team could impair our ability to execute our strategy and implement operational initiatives, which would be likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nIf we cannot obtain sufficient capital when needed, we will not be able to continue with our historical business strategy.\nOur business strategy has historically included maintaining a portfolio of properties that provide long-term, profitable growth through development in areas that support sustainable, lower-risk, repeatable, high-return drilling projects. In the future, we may not be able to obtain financing in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms when needed, which could adversely affect our operating results and prospects. If we cannot raise the capital required to implement our historical business strategy, we may be required to curtail operations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations could be adversely affected if we fail to maintain required bonds.\nFederal and state laws require bonds or cash deposits to secure our obligations with respect to various parts of our operations. Our failure to maintain, or inability to acquire, bonds that are required by state and federal law would have a material adverse effect on us. That failure could result from a variety of factors including: (i) our failure to comply with rules and regulations of Federal and state governmental agencies, including the United States Bureau of Land Management, (ii) the lack of availability of bonding, higher expense or unfavorable market terms of new bonds; (iii) and the exercise by third-party bond issuers of their right to refuse to renew the bonds. If we fail to maintain required bonds, our production may significantly decrease, which would significantly decrease our already constrained cash flow.\nWe cannot control the future price of oil and natural gas and sustained periods of low prices could hurt our profitability and financial condition and could impair our ability to grow our business or to perform the obligations in our agreements, including the agreements governing our indebtedness.\nSustained periods of low commodity prices will adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Our revenues, profitability, liquidity, ability to raise capital for our business, future growth, ability to operate, develop and explore our properties, and the carrying value of our properties depend heavily on prevailing prices for oil and natural gas.\nNatural gas comprised approximately 94% of our total production for the year ended December 31, 2016 and represented 92% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2016. Historically, natural gas prices have been highly volatile, including in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States where the vast majority of our natural gas is produced. Prices have been affected by actions of federal, state and local governments and agencies, foreign governments, national and international economic and political conditions, levels of consumer demand, weather conditions, domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas, proximity and capacity of gas pipelines and other transportation facilities, the price and availability of equipment, materials and personnel to conduct operations, and the price and availability of alternative fuels. These external factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it difficult to estimate future prices of natural gas. Any substantial or extended decline in the price of natural gas will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, including reduced cash flow and borrowing capacity, and lower proved reserves. Price volatility also makes it difficult to budget for and project the return on potential acquisitions and development and exploration projects, and sustained lower gas prices have caused and may, in the future continue to cause, us or the operators of properties in which we have ownership interests to curtail projects and limit or suspend drilling, completion or even production activities.\nCrude oil comprised approximately 6% of our total production for the year ended December 31, 2016 and represented 5% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2016. Crude oil prices declined substantially\nfrom late 2014 through early 2016 and have remained low during the first months of 2017 despite a modest recovery. In the future, crude oil prices may remain at current levels or fall to lower levels. If crude oil prices remain at current levels or fall to lower levels, this will adversely affect our crude oil operations and our financial condition. Most of the production from our Uinta Basin properties is crude oil. At current oil prices, it is not profitable for us to drill and complete new wells on our Uinta Basin properties.\nIn addition, because we are significantly leveraged, a substantial decrease in our revenue due to low commodity prices is currently impairing and may in the future continue to impair our ability to satisfy payment obligations on our indebtedness and reduce funds available for operations and future business opportunities.\nA substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments.\nThe price we receive for our oil and natural gas heavily influences our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. Oil and natural gas are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile. The spot natural gas prices during 2016 ranged from a high of $3.99 to a low of $1.61 per MMBtu and the spot oil prices during 2016 ranged from a high of $54.51 to a low of $26.05 per Bbl. Thus far in 2017, commodity prices have continued to be depressed and volatile, with spot natural gas prices ranging from a high of $3.57 to a low of $2.89 per MMBtu and the spot oil prices ranging from a high of $55.24 to a low of $50.71 per Bbl through February 15, 2017. These markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future.\nThe prices we receive for our production and the levels of our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include the following:\n\u2022\nworldwide and regional economic conditions impacting the global supply and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries;\n\u2022\nthe price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions in or affecting other oil and natural gas-producing countries;\n\u2022\nthe level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production;\n\u2022\nthe level of global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u2022\nlocalized supply and demand fundamentals and transportation availability;\n\u2022\nweather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022\ndomestic, local and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;\n\u2022\nspeculation as to the future price of oil and natural gas and the speculative trading of oil and natural gas futures contracts;\n\u2022\nprice and availability of competitors\u2019 supplies of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption; and\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels.\nSubstantially all of our production is currently sold at market based prices. Lower oil and natural gas prices will reduce our cash flows, borrowing ability and the present value of our reserves. Lower oil and natural gas prices will reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically. Substantial decreases in oil and natural gas prices could render uneconomic a significant portion of our identified drilling locations, and,\nmay cause us to make significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or to be unable to claim proved undeveloped reserves at all. If oil and natural gas prices remain at current levels or experience a substantial or extended decline from current levels, our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures will be materially and adversely affected.\nOur reserve estimates may turn out to be incorrect if the assumptions upon which these estimates are based are inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and projected future rates of production and timing of development expenditures, including many factors beyond our control. The reserve data and standardized measures set forth herein represent only estimates. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact way and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates of different engineers often vary. In addition, drilling, testing and production data acquired subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising such estimates. Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs that are ultimately recovered. Further, the estimated future net revenues from proved reserves and the present value thereof are based upon certain assumptions, including geologic success, the timing and identification of future drilling locations, commodity prices, future production levels, costs and the ability to finance future development that may not prove correct over time. Predictions of future production levels, development schedules (particularly with regard to non-operated properties), commodity prices and future operating costs are subject to great uncertainty, and the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they are based.\nThe present value of net proved reserves included in this report should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the present value, discounted at 10%, of the pre-tax future net cash flows attributable to our net proved reserves on the average oil and natural gas prices during the 12-month period before the ending date of the period covered by this report determined as an un-weighted, arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, adjusted for quality and transportation fees. The costs to produce the reserves remain constant at the costs prevailing on the date of the estimate. Actual current and future commodity prices and costs may be materially higher or lower, and higher future costs and/or lower future commodity prices may impact whether development of our reserves in the future occurs as scheduled or at all. In addition, the 10% discount factor, which the SEC requires us to use in calculating our discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes, may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital from time to time and/or the risks associated with our business.\nCompetitive industry conditions may negatively affect our ability to conduct operations.\nWe compete with numerous other companies in virtually all facets of our business. Our competitors in development, exploration, acquisitions and production include major integrated oil and natural gas companies as well as numerous independents, including many that have significantly greater resources. Therefore, competitors may be able to pay more for desirable leases and evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties or prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. We also compete for the materials, equipment and services that are necessary for the exploration, development and operation of our properties. Our ability to increase reserves in the future will be dependent on our ability to select and acquire suitable prospects for future exploration and development.\nFactors that affect our ability to compete in the marketplace include:\n\u2022\nour access to the capital necessary to drill and complete wells and acquire properties;\n\u2022\nour ability to acquire and analyze seismic, geological and other information relating to a property;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain the personnel necessary to properly evaluate seismic and other information relating to a property;\n\u2022\nour ability to procure materials, equipment and services required to explore, develop and operate our properties;\n\u2022\nour ability to comply with administrative, regulatory and other governmental requirements; and\n\u2022\nour ability to access pipelines, and the locations of facilities used to produce and transport oil and natural gas production.\nFactors beyond our control affect our ability to effectively market production and may ultimately affect our financial results.\nThe ability to market oil and natural gas depends on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nthe extent of domestic production and imports of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe availability of pipeline, rail and refinery capacity, including facilities owned and operated by third parties;\n\u2022\nthe availability of a market for our oil and natural gas production;\n\u2022\nthe availability of satisfactory transportation arrangements for our oil and natural gas production;\n\u2022\nthe proximity of natural gas production to natural gas pipelines;\n\u2022\nthe effects of inclement weather;\n\u2022\nthe demand for oil and natural gas by utilities and other end users;\n\u2022\nthe availability of alternative fuel sources;\n\u2022\nstate and federal regulations of oil and natural gas marketing and transportation; and\n\u2022\nfederal regulation of natural gas sold or transported in interstate commerce.\nBecause of these factors and other factors beyond our control, we may be unable to market all of the oil and natural gas that we produce or obtain favorable prices for such production.\nAny derivative transactions we enter into may limit our gains and expose us to other risks.\nWe may enter into financial derivative transactions from time to time to manage our exposure to commodity price risks. These transactions limit our potential gains if commodity prices rise above the levels established by our derivative transactions. These transactions may also expose us to other risks of financial losses, for example, if our production is less than we anticipated at the time we entered into a derivative instrument or if a counterparty to our derivative instruments fails to perform its obligations under a derivatives transaction.\nLegislation and regulations related to derivative contracts could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.\nTitle VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) establishes federal oversight and regulation of over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives and requires the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d) and the SEC to enact further regulations affecting derivative contracts, including the derivative contracts we use to hedge our exposure to price volatility through the OTC market.\nAlthough the CFTC and the SEC have issued final regulations in certain areas, final rules in other areas and the scope of relevant definitions and/or exemptions still remain to be finalized. In one of its rulemaking proceedings still pending under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC issued on November 5, 2013, a proposed rule imposing position limits for certain futures and option contracts in various commodities (including natural gas) and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Certain specified types of hedging transactions are exempt from these position limits, provided that such hedging transactions satisfy the CFTC\u2019s requirements for \u201cbona fide hedging\u201d transactions or positions. Similarly, the CFTC has issued a proposed rule on margin requirements for swap transactions, which proposes an exemption for commercial end-users, entering into uncleared swaps in order to hedge commercial risks affecting their business, from any requirement to post margin to secure such swap transactions. In addition, the CFTC has issued a final rule authorizing an exception for commercial end-users using swaps to hedge their commercial risks from the otherwise applicable mandatory obligation under the Dodd-Frank Act to clear all swap transactions through a registered derivatives clearing organization and to trade all such swaps on a registered exchange. The Dodd-Frank Act also imposes recordkeeping and reporting obligations on counterparties to swap transactions and other regulatory compliance obligations. All of the above regulations could increase the costs to us of entering into financial derivative transactions to hedge or mitigate our exposure to commodity price volatility and other commercial risks affecting our business.\nWhile it is not possible at this time to predict when the CFTC will issue final rules applicable to position limits or margin requirements, depending on the Company\u2019s ability to satisfy the CFTC\u2019s requirements for the various exemptions available for a commercial end-user using swaps to hedge or mitigate its commercial risks, these rules and regulations may require us to comply with position limits, margin requirements and with certain clearing and trade-execution requirements in connection with our financial derivative activities. The Dodd-Frank Act may require our current counterparties to post additional capital as a result of entering into uncleared financial derivatives with us, which could increase the cost to us of entering into such derivatives. The Dodd-Frank Act may also require our current counterparties to financial derivative transactions to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties, and may cause some entities to cease their current business as hedge providers. These changes could reduce the liquidity of the financial derivatives markets thereby reducing the ability of commercial end-users to have access to financial derivatives to hedge or mitigate their exposure to commodity price volatility. The Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts (including through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available capital for other commercial operations purposes), materially alter the terms of future swaps relative to the terms of our existing bilaterally negotiated financial derivative contracts, and reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against commercial risks we encounter.\nCompliance with environmental and occupational safety and health laws and other government regulations could be costly and could negatively impact our production.\nOur operations are subject to numerous and complex laws and regulations relating to environmental and occupational protection. These laws and regulations, which are continuously being reviewed for amendment and/or expansion, may:\n\u2022\nrequire that we acquire permits before developing our properties;\n\u2022\nrestrict the substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling, completion and production activities;\n\u2022\nlimit or prohibit drilling activities on protected areas such as wetlands or wilderness areas; and\n\u2022\nrequire remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former operations, such as plugging abandoned wells.\nUnder these laws and regulations or under the common law, we could be liable for personal injury and clean-up costs and other environmental, natural resource and property damages, as well as administrative, civil and criminal penalties or injunctions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could also result in the\noccurrence of delays or restrictions in permitting or performance of projects, or the issuance of orders and injunctions limiting or preventing operations relating to our properties in some areas. Under certain environmental laws and regulations, an owner or operator of our properties could be subject to strict, joint and several strict liability for the investigation, removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination, regardless of whether the owner or operator was responsible for the release or contamination or whether the operations were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time the release or contamination occurred. Private parties, including the owners of properties upon which wells are drilled or facilities where petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance, to seek damages for contamination or for personal injury or property damage. We maintain limited insurance coverage for sudden and accidental environmental damages, but do not maintain insurance coverage for the full potential liability that could be caused by accidental environmental damages. Accordingly, we may be subject to liability in excess of our insurance coverage or may be required to cease production from properties in the event of environmental damages.\nWe could also be affected by more stringent laws and regulations adopted in the future, including any related to climate change, engine emissions, greenhouse gases and hydraulic fracturing. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in delays or restrictions in permitting or development of projects or more stringent or costly construction, drilling, water management, or completion activities or waste handling, storage, transport, remediation or disposal, emission or discharge requirements could require significant expenditures by Ultra or other operators of the properties to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, competitive position or financial condition of Ultra or such other operators. Increased scrutiny of the oil and natural gas industry may occur as a result of EPA\u2019s FY2017-2019 National Enforcement Initiatives, through which EPA will purportedly address incidences of noncompliance from natural gas extraction and production activities that may cause or contribute to significant harm to public health and/or the environment.\nA significant percentage of our operations are conducted on federal and state lands. These operations are subject to a wide variety of regulations as well as other permits and authorizations which must be obtained from and issued by state and federal agencies. To conduct these operations, we may be required to file applications for permits, seek agency authorizations and comply with various other statutory and regulatory requirements. Complying with any of these requirements may adversely affect our ability to complete our drilling programs at the costs and in the time periods anticipated.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d (\u201cGHGs\u201d) could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and gas we produce.\nMore stringent laws and regulations relating to climate change and GHGs may be adopted and could cause us to incur material expenses to comply with such laws and regulations. In the absence of comprehensive federal legislation on GHG emission control, the EPA attempted to require the permitting of GHG emissions; although the Supreme Court struck down the permitting requirements, it upheld the EPA\u2019s authority to control GHG emissions when a permit is required due to emissions of other pollutants. The EPA also requires the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities and onshore oil and natural gas processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities, which may include facilities we operate. Reporting of GHG emissions from such facilities is required on an annual basis. We will continue to incur costs associated with this reporting obligation.\nIn May 2016, the EPA finalized rules to reduce methane emissions from new, modified or reconstructed sources in the oil and natural gas sector. The EPA announced in March 2016 that it also intends to reduce methane emissions for existing sources, with a proposed rule expected in 2017. In November 2016, the BLM issued final rules to reduce methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and gas operations on public lands. Several states, including Colorado and Pennsylvania, are pursuing similar measures to regulate emissions of methane from new and existing sources within the oil and natural gas source category.\nIn addition, the United States Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs and many states and regions have already taken legal measures to reduce or measure GHG emission levels, often involving the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs require major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to reduce overall GHG emissions. The cost of these allowances could escalate significantly over time. On an international level, the United States is one of almost 200 nations that agreed in December 2015 to an international climate change agreement in Paris, France that calls for countries to set their own GHG emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its GHG emissions targets. It is not possible at this time to predict how or when the United States might impose restrictions on GHGs as a result of the international climate change agreement. The adoption and implementation of any legislation or regulatory programs imposing GHG reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce.\nPotential physical effects of climate change could adversely affect our operations and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nIn an interpretative guidance on climate change disclosures, the SEC indicates that climate change could have an effect on the severity of weather (including hurricanes and floods), sea levels, the arability of farmland, and water availability and quality. If such effects were to occur, our exploration and production operations, including the hydraulic fracturing of our wells, have the potential to be adversely affected. Potential adverse effects could include disruption of our production activities, including, for example, damages to our facilities from powerful winds or floods, or increases in our costs of operation or reductions in the efficiency of our operations, as well as potentially increased costs for insurance coverages in the aftermath of such effects. Significant physical effects of climate change could also have an indirect effect on our financing and operations by disrupting the transportation or process related services provided by midstream companies, service companies or suppliers with whom we have a business relationship. We may not be able to recover through insurance some or any of the damages, losses or costs that may result from potential physical effects of climate change.\nFederal legislation and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions; however, EPA has taken certain actions with respect to regulating hydraulic fracturing. For example, EPA published permitting guidance in February 2014 addressing the use of diesel fuel in fracturing operations; issued CAA final regulations in 2012 and additional CAA regulations in May 2016 governing performance standards for the oil and natural gas industry; issued in June 2016 final effluent limitations guidelines under the CWA that waste water from shale natural gas extraction operations must meet before discharging to a publicly-owned treatment plant; and issued in 2014 a prepublication of its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, the BLM published a final rule in March 2015 that establishes new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. However, the U.S. District Court of Wyoming struck down this rule in June 2016; the ruling is currently on appeal before the U.S. Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. The BLM also issued new rules in November 2016 which seek to limit methane emissions from new and existing oil and gas operations on federal lands.\nFrom time to time, the U.S. Congress has considered adopting legislation intended to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing\nprocess. In addition, some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. Pennsylvania has adopted a variety of regulations limiting how and where fracturing can be performed. Wyoming has adopted regulations requiring producers to provide detailed information about wells they hydraulically fracture in that state. Some states have adopted or are considering adopting regulations requiring disclosure of chemicals in fluids used in hydraulic fracturing or other restrictions on drilling and completion operations, including requirements regarding casing and cementing of wells; testing of nearby water wells; restrictions on access to, and usage of, water; and restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations. Any other new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform hydraulic fracturing activities and thereby affect our determination of whether a well is commercially viable. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is regulated at the federal level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permit requirements or operational restrictions and also to associated permitting delays and potential increases in costs. We have conducted hydraulic fracturing operations on most of our existing wells, and we anticipate conducting hydraulic fracturing operations on substantially all of our future wells. As a result, restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce in commercial quantities and adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nChanges in tax laws and regulations or in our operations may impact our effective tax rate and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nChanges in tax laws in any of the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our effective tax rate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. President Trump and House Republicans have each promised comprehensive U.S. tax reform. Although we cannot predict the details or scope of such tax reform, general policy proposals from the President and Congress suggest such reform could, for instance, impose a new tax on hydrocarbon production and disallow deductions for net interest expenses, depletion, intangible drilling and development costs and U.S. production manufacturing activities. Other proposals for reform have included other items that would be beneficial for us, for instance, immediate expensing of capital costs. If tax reform is enacted that reduces or eliminates provisions of the tax laws and regulations that allow us to reduce our taxes, whether by deducting expenses or otherwise without providing offsetting benefits, any such reform could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and liquidity.\nCyber-attacks targeting systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry may adversely impact our operations.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, production and financial activities. We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, and communicate with our employees and third party partners. Unauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruptions in our exploration or production operations. Also, computers control nearly all of the oil and gas distribution systems in the United States and abroad, which are necessary to transport our production to market. A cyber-attack directed at oil and gas distribution systems could damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment, delay or prevent delivery of production to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions.\nWhile our operations and financial condition have not been materially and adversely affected by cyber-attacks, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such attacks and resulting losses in the future. Further, as cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber-attacks.\nUnless we are able to replace reserves that we have produced, our cash flows and production will decrease over time.\nOur future success depends on our ability to find, acquire, develop and produce additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Without successful exploration, development or acquisition activities, our reserves and production will decline. We can give no assurance that we will be able to find, develop or acquire additional reserves at acceptable costs.\nWe may not be able to replace our reserves or generate cash flows if we are unable to raise capital. We will be required to make substantial capital expenditures to develop our existing reserves and to discover new oil and gas reserves.\nOur ability to continue exploration and development of our properties and to replace reserves depends upon our ability to comply with our debt covenants, renegotiate our debt agreements, raise significant additional financing, or to seek and obtain other arrangements with industry participants in lieu of raising additional financing. Any arrangements that may be entered into could be expensive to us if such arrangements can be made at all. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital in light of factors such as our financial condition, the market demand for our securities, the general condition of financial markets for independent oil and gas companies (including the markets for debt), oil and natural gas prices and general market conditions. See Item 7 - \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for a discussion of our capital budget. Continued periods of depressed commodity prices or further commodity price decreases could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund capital expenditures. Without the ability to fund capital expenditures, we would be unable to replace reserves and production. There can also be no assurance that we will be able to obtain other satisfactory arrangements to allow further exploration and development of our properties if we are unable to raise additional capital.\nWe expect to use our cash from operations and cash on hand to fund our capital budget during 2017. See Item 7 - \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for information about our liquidity, available cash on hand, and the status of the Credit Agreement. We previously borrowed substantially all of the funds available to us under the Credit Agreement.\nOur operations may be interrupted by severe weather or drilling restrictions.\nOur operations are conducted primarily in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. We also have properties in the north-central Pennsylvania area of the Appalachian Basin. The weather in these areas can be extreme and can cause interruption in our exploration and production operations. Severe weather can result in damage to our facilities entailing longer operational interruptions and significant capital investment. Likewise, our operations are subject to disruption from winter storms and severe cold, which can limit operations involving fluids and impair access to our facilities.\nWe are exposed to operating hazards and uninsured risks that could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow.\nThe oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating risks, including blowouts, fire, explosion, pipe failure, casing collapse, abnormally pressured formations, and environmental hazards such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, discharges of toxic gases, underground migration and surface spills or mishandling of fracture fluids, including chemical additives. The occurrence of any of these events with respect to any property we own or operate (in whole or in part) could have a material adverse impact on us. We and the operators of our properties maintain insurance in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts that management believes to be reasonable. However, insurance coverage is not always economically feasible and is not obtained to cover all types of operational risks. The occurrence of a significant event that is not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThere are risks associated with our drilling activity that could impact our results of operations.\nOur oil and natural gas operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards typically associated with drilling, completion, production and transportation of, oil and natural gas. These risks include the necessity of spending large amounts of money for identification and acquisition of properties and for drilling and completion of wells. In the drilling and completing of wells, failures and losses may occur before any deposits of oil or natural gas are found and produced. The presence of unanticipated pressure or irregularities in formations, blow-outs or accidents may cause such activity to be unsuccessful, resulting in a loss of our investment in such activity and possible liabilities. If oil or natural gas is encountered, there can be no assurance that it can be produced in quantities sufficient to justify the cost of continuing such operations or that it can be marketed satisfactorily.\nOur decision to drill a prospect is subject to a number of factors which may alter our drilling schedule or our plans to drill at all.\nA prospect is an area in which our geoscientists have identified what they believe, based on available seismic and geological information, to be indications of hydrocarbons. Our prospects are in various stages of review. Whether or not we ultimately drill our prospects depends on many factors, including but not limited to: the availability and cost of capital; receipt of additional seismic data or reprocessing of existing data; material changes in current of future expected oil or natural gas prices; the costs and availability of drilling and completion equipment; the success or failure of wells drilled in similar formations or which would use the same production facilities and equipment; changes in the estimates of costs to drill or complete wells; decisions of our joint working interest owners; and regulatory, permitting and other governmental requirements. It is possible these factors and others may cause us to alter our drilling schedule or determine that a prospect should not be pursued at all.\nWe have limited control over activities conducted on properties we do not operate.\nWe own interests in properties that are operated by third parties. The success, timing and costs of drilling, completion, and other development activities on our non-operated properties depend on a number of factors that are beyond our control. Because we have only a limited ability to influence and control the operations of our non-operated properties, we can give no assurances that we will realize our targeted returns with respect to those properties.\nOur business depends on gathering and transportation facilities owned by others. Any limitation in the availability of those facilities would interfere with our ability to market the oil and natural gas that we produce.\nThe marketability of our oil and natural gas production will depend in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering and pipeline systems owned by third parties. The amount of oil and natural gas that can be produced and sold is subject to curtailment in certain circumstances, such as pipeline interruptions due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, excessive pressure, physical damage to the gathering or transportation system, or lack of contracted capacity on such systems. The curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months. In many cases, we are provided only with limited, if any, notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration. Any significant curtailment in gathering system or pipeline capacity, or significant delay in the construction of necessary gathering and transportation facilities, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may fail to fully identify problems with any properties we acquire.\nWe acquired a portion of our acreage position in Wyoming, Pennsylvania, and Utah through property acquisitions and acreage trades, and we may acquire additional acreage in these or other regions in the future. Although we conduct a review of properties we acquire which we believe is consistent with industry practices, we can give no assurance that we have identified or will identify all existing or potential problems associated with such properties or that we will be able to mitigate any problems we do identify.\nOur acquisitions may perform worse than we expected or prove to be worth less than what we paid because of uncertain factors and matters beyond our control. In addition, our acquisitions could expose us to potentially significant liabilities.\nWhen we make acquisitions of oil and gas properties, we make assumptions about many uncertain factors, including estimates of recoverable reserves, expected timing of recovering acquired reserves, future commodity prices, expected development and operating costs, and other matters, many of which are beyond our control. Assumptions about uncertain factors may be wrong, and the properties we acquire may perform worse than we expect, materially and adversely affecting our operations and financial condition.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis report contains or incorporates by reference forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
