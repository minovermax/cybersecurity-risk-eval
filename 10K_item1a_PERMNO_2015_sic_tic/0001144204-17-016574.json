{"cik": "1562214", "company": "ZAIS Group Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe Company\u2019s business and operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of which could adversely affect its business, financial condition, consolidated results of operations and ability to make distributions to stockholders and could cause the value of the Company\u2019s capital stock to decline. Please refer to the section entitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to ZAIS Group\u2019s Business\nIf ZAIS Group is unable to significantly increase its AUM, or develop new sources of revenue, our revenues and operating income will continue to be negatively impacted, and we will likely continue to incur operating losses.\nZAIS Group\u2019s AUM has declined significantly from its peak of $11.707 billion prior to the financial crisis in 2008 to $3.444 billion as of December 31, 2016, largely attributable to the return of investor capital from certain private equity style ZAIS Managed Entities, the termination of certain legacy CLOs managed by ZAIS Group, certain investor redemptions and the challenges of raising significant new assets to replace those assets being returned to investors. While ZAIS Group had historically been profitable until 2015, it incurred net losses in both 2016 and 2015 based on GAAP. ZAIS Group incurred a smaller net loss in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to increases in revenues and other income, including the receipt in 2016 of an $8.0 million termination fee from ZFC REIT. Revenue and results of operations are primarily dependent on the management fee income and incentive income ZAIS Group earns on the assets under its management. During 2016, the alternative asset management industry has been under fee pressure, and ZAIS Group has not been able to maintain its historic fee levels. The CLO origination business, which generally has a lower embedded management fee structure than the mortgage and corporate credit funds, has grown and become a larger percentage of ZAIS Group\u2019s AUM. The typical management fee rates for CLO vehicles generally range between 0.30% and 0.50% and for the mortgage and corporate credit funds the fee rates generally range between 0.50% and 1.50%. As a result, the average fee rate earned by ZAIS Group on the ZAIS Managed Entities has declined. The average AUM during 2015 and 2016 was approximately $4.220 billion and $3.877 billion, respectively. Additionally, ZAIS Managed Entities representing total AUM as of December 31, 2016 of approximately $0.291 billion are winding down and are in liquidation. On October 31, 2016, the management agreement with ZFC REIT was terminated upon completion of the merger between ZFC REIT and Sutherland Asset Management Corp. which resulted in a decrease of $0.589 billion in ZAIS Group\u2019s AUM during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016. As a result of this transaction, management fees earned by ZAIS Group are expected to decrease by approximately $2.8 million annually on a run-rate basis. The decrease in management fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 was offset by the receipt of a termination payment in the amount of $8.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we reported a GAAP net loss of $(3.8) million, compared with GAAP net loss of $(23.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we reported revenue of $31.7 million, which includes the non-recurring $8.0 million termination fee from ZFC REIT as compared with revenue of $23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The current recurring revenue base does not cover the current run-rate of compensation, and general and administrative expenses. The Company currently anticipates that its expenses in 2017 will exceed its revenues as they did in 2015 and 2016. If ZAIS Group is unable to significantly increase its assets under management and thereby generate additional revenue from management fee income and potentially, incentive income, or develop new sources of revenue, it is likely that we will continue incurring operating losses. In that event, we may need to sell assets to raise cash and/or curtail certain business activities, including foregoing additional investments in newly formed ZAIS Managed Entities. There is no assurance that ZAIS Group will be able to increase its assets under management or develop new sources of revenue.\nDifficult market and political conditions may adversely affect ZAIS Group\u2019s business, including by reducing the value or hampering the performance of the investments made by the ZAIS Managed Entities, each of which could materially and adversely affect ZAIS Group\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nZAIS Group\u2019s business is materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic and political conditions throughout the world, such as interest rates, availability and cost of credit, inflation or deflation, economic uncertainty, changes in laws (including laws relating to ZAIS Group\u2019s taxation, taxation of investors in the ZAIS Managed Entities, the possibility of changes to tax laws in either the United States or any non-U.S. jurisdiction and regulations on asset managers), trade barriers, commodity prices, currency exchange rates and controls and national and international political circumstances (including wars, terrorist acts and security operations). These factors are outside of ZAIS Group\u2019s control and may affect the level and volatility of asset prices and the liquidity and value of investments and ZAIS Group may not be able to or may choose not to manage its exposure to these conditions. Increasing uncertainty following the U.S. election and Brexit, among other geopolitical events, could lead to increased market volatility in 2017 and future years, and uncertainty and instability for investment management businesses. These and other conditions in the global financial markets and the global economy may result in adverse consequences for the ZAIS Managed Entities and their respective investee companies and investments, which could restrict their investment activities and impede their ability to effectively achieve investment objectives.\nIn the event of a market downturn, each of ZAIS Group\u2019s businesses could be affected in different ways. The ZAIS Managed Entities, ZGP, ZAIS Group or its subsidiaries may face reduced opportunities to sell and realize value from their existing investments, and a lack of suitable investments for the ZAIS Managed Entities, ZGP, ZAIS Group or its subsidiaries to make. In addition, adverse market or economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the returns of the ZAIS Managed Entities and investments directly held by ZGP, ZAIS Group or its subsidiaries, and, therefore, ZAIS Group\u2019s earnings. A general market downturn, or a specific market dislocation, may cause ZAIS Group\u2019s revenue and results of operations to decline by causing:\n\u2022 the net asset value or the AUM of ZAIS Managed Entities to decrease, lowering management fees;\n\u2022 lower investment returns, reducing incentive income; and\n\u2022 investor redemptions, resulting in lower fees.\nFurthermore, while difficult market conditions may increase opportunities to make certain distressed asset investments, such conditions also increase the risk of default with respect to investments held by the ZAIS Managed Entities, ZGP, ZAIS Group or its subsidiaries. The attractiveness of the ZAIS Managed Entities relative to other investment products could decrease depending on economic conditions. The ZAIS Managed Entities, ZGP, ZAIS Group or its subsidiaries may also be adversely affected by difficult market conditions if ZAIS Group fails to predict the adverse effect of such conditions on particular investments, resulting in a significant reduction in the value of those investments.\nThe investment management business is competitive.\nThe investment management business is highly competitive, with competition based on a variety of factors, including investment performance, business relationships, quality of service provided to investors, investor liquidity and willingness to invest, ZAIS Managed Entities\u2019 terms (including fees), brand recognition and business reputation. ZAIS Group competes for investors with other investment managers, public and private funds, business development companies, small business investment companies and others. Numerous factors increase ZAIS Group\u2019s competitive risks, including:\n\u2022 a number of ZAIS Group\u2019s competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and more personnel than ZAIS Group does;\n\u2022 some of the ZAIS Managed Entities may not perform as well as competitors\u2019 funds or other available investment products;\n\u2022 a number of ZAIS Group\u2019s competitors have raised significant amounts of capital, and some of them have similar investment objectives to ZAIS Group\u2019s, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities and may reduce the size and duration of pricing inefficiencies that otherwise could be exploited;\n\u2022 some of ZAIS Group\u2019s competitors may have a lower cost of capital and access to funding resources that are not available to ZAIS Group, which may create competitive disadvantages for the ZAIS Managed Entities;\n\u2022 some of ZAIS Group\u2019s competitors may be subject to less regulation and, accordingly, may have more flexibility to undertake and execute certain businesses or investments than ZAIS Group does or bear less compliance expense than ZAIS Group does;\n\u2022 some of ZAIS Group\u2019s competitors may have more flexibility than ZAIS Group has in raising certain types of funds under the investment management contracts they have negotiated with their investors;\n\u2022 some of ZAIS Group\u2019s competitors may have better expertise or be regarded by investors as having better expertise than ZAIS Group in a specific asset class or geographic region; and\n\u2022 other industry participants may, from time to time, seek to recruit ZAIS Group\u2019s investment professionals and other employees away from ZAIS Group.\nThis competitive pressure could adversely affect ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to make successful investments and limit ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to obtain future funds for management, either of which would adversely impact ZAIS Group\u2019s business and our results of operations and financial condition.\nZAIS Group\u2019s operating cash flow may continue to be insufficient to fund its operating expenses which are currently funded by the proceeds of the Business Combination, reducing the amount of capital available to invest and correspondingly decreasing the amount of revenue potentially generated by the investments.\nZAIS Group primarily uses cash flow from operations to pay compensation and benefits, general, administrative and other expenses and foreign taxes. ZAIS Group\u2019s cash flows are also used to fund various investments, including investments in entities in which ZAIS Group serves as the investment manager, property and equipment and other capital items. If cash flow from operations continues to be insufficient to fund operating expenses or such investments, ZAIS Group will continue to fund a portion of its business requirements with the proceeds from the Business Combination. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company\u2019s stand-alone (excluding the activities of the Consolidated Funds, as defined below) net cash used in operations was $8.1 million. The sources of operating cash flow were insufficient to cover operating expenses, and the excess working capital needs were funded by the proceeds of the Business Combination. The Company currently anticipates that this negative working capital trend will continue in 2017, and could limit our ability to expand our investments from the proceeds of the Business Combination, thereby decreasing the revenue potentially generated by the capital invested from the Business Combination.\nZAIS Group\u2019s AUM has been subject to volatility and certain ZAIS Managed Entities are being liquidated or may be disposed of in the near term.\nHistorically, ZAIS Group\u2019s AUM has fluctuated from time to time. ZAIS Group\u2019s AUM has declined significantly from its peak of $11.707 billion prior to the financial crisis in 2008 to $3.444 billion as of December 31, 2016, largely attributable to the return of investor capital from certain private equity style ZAIS Managed Entities, the termination of certain legacy CLOs managed by ZAIS Group, the termination of the Company\u2019s management agreement with ZFC REIT, certain investor redemptions and the challenges of raising significant new assets to replace those assets being returned to investors. These challenges stem largely from structured credit products being disfavored by certain investors seeking to deploy structured credit when dislocation occurs, rather than to earn cash flows from current positions in structured credit and take advantage of dislocations when they arise. Additionally, European investors have exited because of capital considerations due to regulatory requirements.\nFurther, ZAIS Managed Entities representing total AUM as of December 31, 2016 of approximately $0.291 billion are winding down and are in liquidation. These liquidations are expected to occur within the next 12 to 24 months. Clients invested in separately managed accounts may generally withdraw their invested capital with little or no notice which could further reduce ZAIS Group\u2019s AUM. On October 31, 2016, the Company\u2019s management agreement with ZFC REIT was terminated upon completion of the merger between ZFC REIT and Sutherland Asset Management Corp. which resulted in a decrease of $0.589 billion of ZAIS Group\u2019s AUM during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016. As a result, management fees earned by ZAIS Group are expected to decrease by approximately $2.8 million annually on a run-rate basis. The decrease in management fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 was offset by the receipt of a termination payment in the amount of $8.0 million. If ZAIS Group is unable to raise significant new assets to replace those that have and will be returned to investors, its AUM would be subject to further decline resulting in a lower base of assets on which it charges management fees and may receive incentive income. This, in turn, would continue to negatively impact ZAIS Group\u2019s revenue and results of operations.\nZAIS Group derives a substantial portion of its revenues from ZAIS Managed Entities managed pursuant to advisory agreements that may be terminated.\nThe applicable investment advisory agreement for each of the ZAIS Managed Entities may permit the investors in a ZAIS Managed Entity to remove ZAIS Group as investment manager in certain circumstances. ZAIS Group\u2019s separately managed accounts are governed by investment management agreements that may be terminated by investors, generally upon little or no notice and with or without cause, as set forth in the applicable agreement. Termination of these agreements would reduce ZAIS Group\u2019s AUM and therefore negatively affect ZAIS Group\u2019s revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nZAIS Group may not be able to maintain its current fee structure as a result of industry pressure from the ZAIS Managed Entities\u2019 investors to reduce fees, which could have an adverse effect on its profit margins and our results of operations.\nZAIS Group has experienced declines in its fee structures for new mandates as a result of industry pressure from the ZAIS Managed Entities\u2019 investors to reduce fees. Although ZAIS Group\u2019s investment management fees vary among and within asset classes, historically ZAIS Group has competed primarily on the basis of its performance and not on the level of its investment management fees relative to those of its competitors. In recent years, however, there has been a general trend toward lower fees in the investment management industry as well as a general trend toward reducing management fees and incentive income to external managers, whether through direct reductions, deferrals, rebates or fee sharing arrangements. ZAIS Group\u2019s average management fees charged with respect to certain asset types has declined as a result of this industry pressure towards lower fees. Although ZAIS Group has no obligation to modify any of its fees with respect to the existing ZAIS Managed Entities, it may experience pressure to do so. No assurance can be made that ZAIS Group will succeed in providing investment returns and service that will allow ZAIS Group to maintain its current fee structure. Fee reductions on existing or future businesses could have an adverse effect on ZAIS Group\u2019s profit margins and our results of operations.\nThe historical returns attributable to the ZAIS Managed Entities should not be considered as indicative of the future results of ZAIS Group or any ZAIS Managed Entity or of any returns expected on an investment in Class A Common Stock of ZAIS.\nAn investment in Class A Common Stock is not an investment in any of the ZAIS Managed Entities. The historical performance of the ZAIS Managed Entities is relevant to ZAIS Group primarily insofar as it is indicative of fees ZAIS Group has earned in the past and may earn in the future and ZAIS Group\u2019s reputation and ability to raise new investments in ZAIS Managed Entities. The historical and potential returns of the ZAIS Managed Entities are not, however, directly linked to returns on Class A Common Stock. Therefore, you should not conclude that positive performance of ZAIS Managed Entities will result in positive returns on an investment in Class A Common Stock, nor should you conclude that ZAIS Managed Entities\u2019 prior performance is indicative of the future results of the ZAIS Managed Entities. Poor future performance of the ZAIS Managed Entities could cause a decline in ZAIS Group\u2019s revenues and could therefore have a negative effect on ZAIS Group\u2019s operating results and returns on the Class A Common Stock.\nMoreover, the historical returns of the ZAIS Managed Entities should not be considered indicative of the future returns of those ZAIS Managed Entities or from any future ZAIS Managed Entities, in part because:\n\u2022 market conditions during previous periods may have been significantly more favorable for generating positive performance than the market conditions ZAIS Group may experience in the future;\n\u2022 The ZAIS Managed Entities\u2019 returns have previously benefited from investment opportunities and general market conditions that may not recur, and the ZAIS Managed Entities may not be able to achieve the same returns or profitable investment opportunities or deploy capital as quickly;\n\u2022 some of the ZAIS Managed Entities\u2019 rates of returns are calculated on the basis of market value of the ZAIS Managed Entities\u2019 investments, including unrealized gains, which may never be realized;\n\u2022 in recent years, there has been increased competition for investment opportunities which may reduce the ZAIS Managed Entities\u2019 returns in the future; and\n\u2022 ZAIS Group\u2019s newly established ZAIS Managed Entities may generate lower returns during the period that they take to deploy their capital.\nThe future internal rate of return for any current or future ZAIS Managed Entity may vary considerably from the historical internal rate of return generated by any particular ZAIS Managed Entity, or for the ZAIS Managed Entities as a whole. Future returns will also be affected by the risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including risks of the industries and businesses in which a particular ZAIS Managed Entity invests.\nPoor performance of the ZAIS Managed Entities would cause a decline in ZAIS Group\u2019s revenue and results of operations, and would adversely affect ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to obtain investments in future ZAIS Managed Entities.\nZAIS Group\u2019s revenue is derived principally from two sources: (1) management fee income, based on the size of the ZAIS Managed Entities and (2) incentive income, based on the performance of the ZAIS Managed Entities. A portion of ZAIS Group\u2019s revenue and cash flow is variable, primarily due to the fact that incentive income can vary from year to year. Incentive income from certain ZAIS Managed Entities may, in some cases, be subject to (i) a hurdle and a perpetual loss carry forward, or \u201cperpetual high-water mark,\u201d meaning that the funds and accounts will not pay incentive fees/allocations with respect to positive investment performance generated for an investor in any year following negative investment performance until that loss is recouped, at which point an investor\u2019s capital balance surpasses the high-water mark or (ii) a priority of payments under which investor capital must be returned and a preferred return must be paid to the investor prior to any payments of incentive-based income to ZAIS Group. For the year ended December 31, 2016, incentive income was 29.5% of ZAIS Group\u2019s total revenues, representing a 31.1% increase over the year ended December 31, 2015. Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes the $8.0 million termination fee received by ZAIS Group from ZFC REIT. For the year ended December 31, 2015, incentive income was 30.7% of ZAIS Group\u2019s total revenues. In the event that any of the ZAIS Managed Entities perform poorly, ZAIS Group\u2019s revenue and results of operations will decline, and it will likely be more difficult for ZAIS Group to obtain new investments in ZAIS Managed Entities. In addition, investors may withdraw their investments in the ZAIS Managed Entities (or, in the case of separately managed accounts, terminate investment management agreements) as a result of poor performance of the ZAIS Managed Entities or otherwise. ZAIS Group\u2019s investors and potential investors continually assess the ZAIS Managed Entities\u2019 performance and ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to obtain new investments for management.\nEmployee misconduct could harm ZAIS Group by impairing ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to attract and retain investors for the ZAIS Managed Entities and subjecting ZAIS Group to significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.\nZAIS Group\u2019s ability to attract and retain investors and to pursue investment opportunities for the ZAIS Managed Entities depends heavily upon the reputation of ZAIS Group and its professionals, especially ZAIS Group\u2019s senior professionals. ZAIS Group is subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from ZAIS Group\u2019s investment management business. Violation of these obligations and standards by any ZAIS Group employee could adversely affect investors in the ZAIS Managed Entities and ZAIS. The nature of ZAIS Group\u2019s business often require that it deal with confidential matters of great significance to companies in which the ZAIS Managed Entities may invest. If ZAIS Group\u2019s employees were to use or disclose confidential information improperly, ZAIS Group could suffer serious harm to its reputation, financial position and current and future business relationships. It is not always possible to detect or deter employee misconduct, and the extensive precautions ZAIS Group takes to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases. If one or more of ZAIS Group\u2019s employees were to engage in misconduct or were to be accused of such misconduct, ZAIS Group\u2019s businesses and reputation could be adversely affected and a loss of investor confidence could result, which would adversely impact ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to obtain new funds for management.\nWe may be subject to financial criminal activity which could result in financial loss or damage to our reputation.\nInstances of financial criminal activity, personal trading violations and other abuses, including misappropriation of assets by internal or external perpetrators, may arise despite our internal control policies and procedures. Instances of such criminal activity by financial firms and their personnel, including those in the investment management industry, have led the U.S. government and regulators to increase enforcement of existing rules relating to such activities, adopt new rules and regulations and enhance oversight of the U.S. financial industry. Because ZAIS entities conduct business internationally, they are subject to the rules of other jurisdictions that govern and control financial criminal activities, and may be exposed to financial criminal activities on an international scale. Compliance with existing and new rules and regulations may have the effect of increasing expenses. Further, should the personnel of any ZAIS entity be linked to financial criminal activity, either domestically or internationally, it would suffer material damage to its reputation which could result in a corresponding loss of clients, client assets and revenue.\nWe are vulnerable to reputational harm because we operate in an industry in which personal relationships, integrity and client confidence are of critical importance. For example, if an employee were to engage in illegal or suspicious activities, we could be subject to legal or regulatory sanctions and suffer serious reputational harm (as a consequence of the negative perception resulting from such activities), which could impair client relationships and the ability to attract new clients.\nReputational harm could result in a loss of AUM and revenues.\nThe integrity of ZAIS Group\u2019s brand is critical to its ability to attract and retain clients, business partners and employees and maintain relationships with consultants. ZAIS Group operates within the highly regulated financial services industry and various potential scenarios could result in harm to its reputation. They include internal operational failures, failure to follow investment or legal guidelines in the management of accounts, intentional or unintentional misrepresentation of ZAIS Group\u2019s products and services in offering or advertising materials, public relations information, social media or other external communications, employee misconduct (including prohibited postings on social media), legal or regulatory actions against ZAIS Group or investments in businesses or industries that are controversial to certain special interest groups. The negative publicity associated with any of these factors could harm ZAIS Group\u2019s reputation and adversely impact relationships with existing and potential clients, third-party distributors, consultants and other business partners and subject ZAIS Group to regulatory sanctions. Damage to ZAIS Group\u2019s brands or reputation would negatively impact its standing in the industry and result in loss of business in both the short term and the long term.\nA significant portion of ZAIS Group\u2019s AUM is or may be derived from a small number of clients, the loss of which could significantly reduce ZAIS Group\u2019s management fees and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nCertain of ZAIS Group\u2019s strategies derive a significant portion of their total AUM from assets of a single client or a small number of clients. As of December 31, 2016, the ten largest investors, the two largest investors and the largest investor accounted for approximately 43%, 29% and 17% of ZAIS Group\u2019s AUM (including AUM of the CLO vehicles managed by ZAIS Group), respectively. The same investors accounted for approximately 89%, 60% and 35% of ZAIS Group\u2019s AUM (excluding AUM relating to the CLO vehicles managed by ZAIS Group). If any of these clients withdraw all or a portion of their AUM, ZAIS Group\u2019s business would be significantly affected, which would negatively impact ZAIS Group\u2019s management fees and could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, ZAIS Group\u2019s CLO management business accounts for approximately 51% of ZAIS Group\u2019s AUM and a loss of key employees associated with the CLO management business may impact ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to expand or continue this business and could result in the loss of a significant amount of ZAIS Group\u2019s AUM.\nZAIS Group\u2019s failure to comply with investment guidelines set by its clients and limitations imposed by applicable law could result in damage awards against ZAIS Group and a loss of ZAIS Group\u2019s AUM, either of which could adversely affect its results of operations or financial condition.\nCertain clients who retain ZAIS Group to manage assets on their behalf specify guidelines regarding investment allocations and strategy that ZAIS Group is required to follow in managing their portfolios. In addition, ZAIS Group is required to comply with the investment guidelines and limitations set forth in the constituting and offering documents of the ZAIS Managed Entities. ZAIS Group\u2019s failure to comply with any of these guidelines and other limitations could result in losses to clients which, depending on the circumstances, could result in ZAIS Group being obligated to make clients whole for such losses. If ZAIS Group believed that the circumstances did not justify a reimbursement, or clients believed the reimbursement it offered was insufficient, they could seek to recover damages from ZAIS Group, withdraw assets from the ZAIS Managed Entities or terminate their investment advisory agreement with ZAIS Group. Any of these events could harm ZAIS Group\u2019s reputation and adversely affect its business.\nZAIS is taxable as a corporation for U.S. tax purposes and a change in projected long-term profitability could materially impact after-tax results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company recorded a Deferred Tax Asset (\u201cDTA\u201d) of approximately $7.0 million related to Net Operating Loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards and other future deductible amounts related to the Company\u2019s allocable share of the consolidated results of operations as well as NOL carryforwards and development stage start-up expenses incurred during the period from its inception and prior to the closing of its Business Combination with ZGP. These DTAs relate to NOL carryforwards and future deductible amounts that can be used to offset the Company\u2019s taxable income in future periods and reduce its income taxes payable in those future periods. Unless the Company is able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize its NOL carryforwards before their expiration, it is likely that some or all of these NOL carryforwards could ultimately expire unused. The Company incurred a net book loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 and it is anticipated the expenses will again exceed revenues in 2017. Accordingly, management believes that it is not more likely than not that its deferred tax asset will be realized and the Company has established a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2016.\nZAIS Group\u2019s expenses are subject to fluctuations that could materially impact our results of operations.\nZAIS Group\u2019s results of operations depend, in part, on the level of ZAIS Group\u2019s expenses, which can vary from period to period. The Company currently anticipates that its expenses in 2017 will exceed its revenues, as they did in 2016 and 2015. If ZAIS Group is unable to significantly increase its assets under management and thereby generate additional revenue from management fee income and potentially, incentive income, or develop new sources of revenue, it is likely that it will continue incurring operating losses. In that event, ZAIS Group may need to sell assets to raise cash and/or curtail certain business activities, including foregoing additional investments in newly formed ZAIS Managed Entities or investment vehicles. ZAIS Group and its affiliates have a certain level of recurring expenses in their day-to-day operations, and some of those expenses cannot be materially reduced. If ZAIS Group\u2019s revenues do not increase, even with decreases in variable expenses, ZAIS Group\u2019s results of operations will continue to be negatively impacted as is the case in the current year. Although management is evaluating certain alternatives which could alter the operating loss trend, there is no specific plan at this point in time that has been identified to alter the operating loss trend in future years. While ZAIS Group attempts to project expense levels in advance, there is no guarantee that unforeseen expenses will not arise.\nZAIS and ZAIS Group may be subject to litigation risks and may face liabilities and damage to ZAIS Group\u2019s professional reputation as a result.\nIn recent years, the volume of claims and amount of damages claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against investment managers have been increasing. ZAIS Group makes investment decisions on behalf of investors in the ZAIS Managed Entities that could result in substantial losses. This may subject ZAIS Group to legal liabilities or actions alleging, among other things, negligence, intentional misconduct, breach of fiduciary duty or breach of contract. Further, ZAIS Group may be subject to third-party litigation arising from allegations that ZAIS Group improperly exercised control or influence over investments. In addition, ZAIS, ZAIS Group and, the ZAIS Managed Entities, and each of their respective officers and employees are each exposed to the risks of litigation related to investment activities, including litigation from investors and shareholders. Additionally, ZAIS Group is exposed to risks of litigation or investigation by investors or regulators alleging that ZAIS Group or a ZAIS Managed Entity engaged in transactions that presented conflicts of interest that were not properly addressed.\nLegal liability or the commencement of legal actions against ZAIS or ZAIS Group could have a material adverse effect on ZAIS Group\u2019s reputation, business, financial condition and/or results of operations. ZAIS Group depends to a large extent on its business relationships and reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain investors and to pursue investment opportunities for the ZAIS Managed Entities. As a result, allegations of improper conduct by ZAIS or ZAIS Group by either private litigants or regulators, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to ZAIS or ZAIS Group, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us, ZAIS Group\u2019s investment activities or the investment industry in general, whether or not valid, may harm ZAIS Group\u2019s reputation, which may be damaging to its businesses and negatively impact our results of operations.\nThe cost of insuring ZAIS Group\u2019s business is significant and may increase.\nZAIS Group\u2019s and our insurance costs are significant and can fluctuate substantially from year to year. In addition, certain insurance coverage may not be available or may only be available at prohibitive costs. As insurance coverage is renewed, it may be subject to additional costs caused by premium increases, higher deductibles, co-insurance liability, changes in the size of ZAIS Group\u2019s business or nature of ZAIS Group\u2019s operations, litigation or acquisitions or dispositions. ZAIS Group may also obtain additional form, and increased level, of coverage which may involve materially increased costs.\nIn addition, we may obtain additional liability insurance for our directors and officers. There have been historical periods in which directors' and officers' liability insurance and errors and omissions insurance have been available only with limited coverage amounts, less favorable terms or at prohibitive cost, and these conditions could recur.\nRisks Related to the ZAIS Managed Entities\nDependence on leverage by certain of the ZAIS Managed Entities subjects them to potential volatility and contractions in the debt financing markets and could adversely affect ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to achieve attractive rates of return on those investments.\nCertain of the ZAIS Managed Entities use leverage, and ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to achieve attractive rates of return on investments in those ZAIS Managed Entities depends on ZAIS Group\u2019s (or, in the case of a separately managed account, the client\u2019s) ability to access sufficient sources of indebtedness at attractive rates. The ZAIS Managed Entities may choose to use leverage as part of their respective investment programs. As of December 31, 2016, ZAIS Group served as investment manager to two ZAIS Managed Entities utilizing various degrees of leverage. These two ZAIS Managed Entities had combined AUM of $1.011 billion. The weighted average leverage ratio of these ZAIS Managed Entities is approximately 14.65% (based on net asset value), with one of the ZAIS Managed Entities accounting for a majority of the leverage employed. The use of leverage poses a significant degree of risk and enhances the possibility of a significant loss to investors. A ZAIS Managed Entity may borrow money from time to time to make investments or may enter into derivative transactions that have embedded leverage. The interest expense and other costs incurred in connection with such borrowing or embedded leverage may not be recovered by returns on such investments and may be lost, and the timing and magnitude of such losses may be accelerated or exacerbated, in the event of a decline in the market value of such investments. Gains realized with borrowed funds may cause the ZAIS Managed Entity\u2019s net asset value to increase at a faster rate than would be the case without borrowings. Losses realized with borrowed funds may also cause the net asset value of the related ZAIS Managed Entity to decrease at a faster rate than would be the case without borrowings. Any of the foregoing circumstances could have a material adverse effect on ZAIS Group\u2019s business and our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe use of leverage also gives rise to counterparty risk. In connection with repo financings and certain swap transactions, some ZAIS Managed Entities are required to post an initial margin and subsequent variation margin calls. If the counterparty should become insolvent, initial and variation margin posted by a ZAIS Managed Entity could be lost due to the failure of the counterparty.\nIf the ZAIS Managed Entities or the issuers or companies in which the ZAIS Managed Entities invest raise capital in the structured credit, leveraged loan or high yield bond markets, the results of their operations may suffer if such markets experience dislocations, contractions or volatility. Any such events could adversely impact the availability of credit to businesses generally and could lead to an overall weakening of the U.S. and global economies. Any economic downturn could adversely affect the financial resources of the ZAIS Managed Entities and their investments (in particular those investments that depend on credit from third parties or that otherwise participate in the credit markets) and their ability to make principal and interest payments on, or refinance, outstanding debt when due. Moreover, these events could affect the terms of available debt financing with, for example, higher rates, higher equity requirements or more restrictive covenants.\nThe absence of available sources of sufficient debt financing for extended periods of time or an increase in either the general levels of interest rates or in the risk spread demanded by sources of indebtedness would make it more expensive to finance those investments. Certain investments may also be financed through borrowings on ZAIS Managed Entities\u2019 debt facilities, which may or may not be available for a refinancing at the end of their respective terms. In addition, the interest payments on the indebtedness used to finance the ZAIS Managed Entities\u2019 investments are generally deductible expenses for applicable income tax purposes, but may be subject to limitations with respect to timing or amount under applicable tax law and policy. Any change in such tax law or policy to eliminate or substantially limit the availability of these income tax deductions may reduce the after-tax rates of return on the affected investments for certain investors, which may have an adverse impact on ZAIS Group\u2019s businesses and our financial results.\nIf the markets make it difficult or impossible to refinance debt that is maturing in the near term, some of ZAIS Group\u2019s investee companies may be unable to repay such debt at maturity and may be forced to sell assets, undergo a recapitalization or seek bankruptcy protection. Any of the foregoing circumstances could have a material adverse effect on ZAIS Group\u2019s business and our results of operations and financial condition.\nSome of the ZAIS Managed Entities may invest in companies that are highly leveraged, which may increase the risk of loss associated with those investments.\nSome of the ZAIS Managed Entities may invest in companies whose capital structures involve significant leverage. For example, in many non-distressed leveraged loan investments, indebtedness may be as much as 75% or more of an investee company\u2019s total debt and equity capitalization, including debt that may be incurred in connection with the ZAIS Managed Entities\u2019 investment, whether incurred at or above the investment-level entity. In distressed situations, indebtedness may exceed 100% or more of an investee company\u2019s capitalization. Additionally, while the ZAIS Managed Entities generally purchase senior positions in the aforementioned companies, the debt positions acquired by the ZAIS Managed Entities may be the most junior in what could be a complex capital structure, and thus subject ZAIS Group to the greatest risk of loss.\nInvestments in highly leveraged entities are also inherently more sensitive to declines in revenues, increases in expenses and interest rates and adverse economic, market and industry developments.\nFurthermore, incurring a significant amount of indebtedness by an entity could, among other things:\n\u2022 subject the entity to a number of restrictive covenants, terms and conditions, any violation of which could be viewed by creditors as an event of default and could materially impact a ZAIS Managed Entity\u2019s ability to realize value from the investment;\n\u2022 allow even moderate reductions in operating cash flow to render the entity unable to service its indebtedness, leading to a bankruptcy or other reorganization of the entity and a loss of part or all of the ZAIS Managed Entities\u2019 investment in it;\n\u2022 give rise to an obligation to make mandatory prepayments of debt using excess cash flow, which might limit the entity\u2019s ability to respond to changing industry conditions if additional cash is needed for the response, to make unplanned but necessary capital expenditures or to take advantage of growth opportunities;\n\u2022 limit the entity\u2019s ability to adjust to changing market conditions, thereby placing it at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have relatively less debt;\n\u2022 limit the entity\u2019s ability to engage in strategic acquisitions that might be necessary to generate attractive returns or further growth; and\n\u2022 limit the entity\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing or increase the cost of obtaining such financing, including for capital expenditures, working capital or other general corporate purposes.\nA substantial portion of the investments owned by the ZAIS Managed Entities are recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by ZAIS Group and, as a result, there may be uncertainty regarding the value of the investments of the ZAIS Managed Entities.\nThe debt and equity instruments in which the ZAIS Managed Entities invest for which market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by ZAIS Group or such other party as may be responsible for the valuation of the relevant ZAIS Managed Entity. Most, if not all, of ZAIS Managed Entities\u2019 investments (other than cash and cash equivalents) are classified as Level 3 under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820 - Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. This means that the valuation of assets owned by the ZAIS Managed Entities is based on unobservable inputs and assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability in question. Inputs into the determination of fair value of the ZAIS Managed Entities\u2019 investments require significant management judgment or estimation. Even if observable market data is available, such information may be the result of consensus pricing information, stale information or broker quotes, which include a disclaimer that the broker would not be held to such a price in an actual transaction. The non-binding nature of consensus pricing or quotes accompanied by disclaimers materially reduces the reliability of such information and the pricing indications received may not accurately reflect the price at which a third party is willing to enter into a transaction.\nThe types of factors that ZAIS Group may take into account in determining the fair value of ZAIS Managed Entities\u2019 investments generally include prices received from third party valuation agents, broker quotes (if available), market rates of interest, general economic conditions, economic conditions in particular industries, the condition of financial markets, the financial condition of issuers, recent trading activity, and other relevant factors. Because such valuations are inherently uncertain, may take into account prices that fluctuate substantially over short periods of time and may be based on estimates, ZAIS Group\u2019s determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these debt and equity instruments existed.\nBecause there is significant uncertainty in the valuation of, or in the stability of the value of illiquid investments, the fair values of such investments as reflected in a ZAIS Managed Entity\u2019s net asset value do not necessarily reflect the prices that would actually be obtained by ZAIS Group on behalf of the ZAIS Managed Entity when such investments are sold. ZAIS Managed Entities\u2019 net asset value could be adversely affected if determinations regarding the fair value of such ZAIS Managed Entity\u2019s investments were materially higher than the values that such ZAIS Managed Entity ultimately realizes upon the disposal of such loans and securities. Realizations at values significantly lower than the values at which investments have been reflected in the ZAIS Managed Entity net asset values would result in losses for the applicable ZAIS Managed Entity, a decline in asset management fees and the loss of potential incentive income. Also, a situation where asset values turn out to be materially different than values reflected in a ZAIS Managed Entity\u2019s net asset value could cause investors to lose confidence in ZAIS Group which could, in turn, result in redemptions from the ZAIS Managed Entities or difficulties in raising additional funds for ZAIS Group to manage.\nThe ZAIS Managed Entities may face risks relating to undiversified investments.\nWhile diversification within the asset classes in which the ZAIS Managed Entities invest is generally an objective of the ZAIS Managed Entities, there can be no assurance as to the degree of diversification, if any, that will be achieved in any ZAIS Managed Entity. Difficult market conditions or slowdowns affecting a particular asset class, geographic region or other category of investment could have a significant adverse impact on a ZAIS Managed Entity if its investments are concentrated in that area, which would result in lower investment returns. Such lack of diversification could expose a ZAIS Managed Entity to losses disproportionate to economic conditions or market declines in general if there are disproportionately greater adverse movements in the particular investments. If a ZAIS Managed Entity holds investments concentrated in a particular issuer, security, asset class or geographic region, such ZAIS Managed Entity may be more susceptible than a more widely diversified investment portfolio to the negative consequences of a single corporate, economic, political or regulatory event. Accordingly, a lack of diversification on the part of a ZAIS Managed Entity could adversely affect its performance and, as a result, ZAIS Group\u2019s business and our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, since ZAIS Group invests directly in certain ZAIS Managed Entities, ZAIS Group is subject to the same diversification risks as the ZAIS Managed Entities disclosed herein.\nInvestments made by the ZAIS Managed Entities may be volatile and may have limited liquidity.\nMany of the ZAIS Managed Entities invest in relatively high-risk, illiquid assets that often have significantly leveraged capital structures, and ZAIS Group may fail to realize any profits from these investments for a considerable period of time, lose some or the entire principal amount it invests in these investments or may not be able to liquidate these investments at a desired price.\nThe ZAIS Managed Entities may make investments or hold trading positions in markets that are volatile and may be illiquid. Timely divestiture or sale of trading positions can be impaired by decreased trading volume, increased price volatility, concentrated trading positions, limitations on the ability to transfer positions in highly specialized or structured transactions, limits imposed by exchanges or other regulatory organizations, market disruptions and changes in industry and government regulations. When a ZAIS Managed Entity holds a security or position, it is vulnerable to price and value fluctuations and may experience losses if the value of the position decreases and it is unable to sell, hedge or transfer the position in a timely manner. Any losses suffered by the ZAIS Managed Entity may have a negative impact on ZAIS Group\u2019s results of operations.\nIn particular, with respect to futures contracts, it may be difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when there is a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market. Limits imposed by futures exchanges or other regulatory organizations, such as accountability levels, position limits and price fluctuation limits, may contribute to a lack of liquidity with respect to certain investments. In addition, over-the-counter contracts and cleared swaps may be illiquid because they are contracts between two parties and generally may not be transferred by one party to a third party without the counterparty\u2019s consent. Conversely, a counterparty may give its consent, but a ZAIS Managed Entity still may not be able to transfer an over-the-counter contract to a third party due to concerns regarding the counterparty\u2019s credit risk. In addition, the ZAIS Managed Entities\u2019 assets are subject to the risk of failure of any of the exchanges or other trading platforms on which their positions trade or of central clearinghouses or counterparties. Most U.S. exchanges limit fluctuations in certain prices during a single day by imposing \u201cdaily price fluctuation limits\u201d or \u201cdaily limits,\u201d the existence of which may reduce liquidity or effectively curtail trading in particular markets.\nTherefore, it may be impossible or costly for the ZAIS Managed Entities to liquidate positions rapidly, particularly if the relevant market is moving against a position or in the event of trading halts or daily price movement limits on the market or otherwise. Alternatively, it may not be possible in certain circumstances for a position to be purchased or sold promptly, particularly if there is insufficient trading activity in the relevant market or otherwise. Additionally, since ZAIS Group invests directly in certain ZAIS Managed Entities, ZAIS Group is subject to the same volatility and liquidity risks as the ZAIS Managed Entities disclosed herein.\nInvestments by the ZAIS Managed Entities may rank junior to investments made by others.\nThe securities in which the ZAIS Managed Entities invest may be subordinate to other securities of the third party issuers. By their terms, the senior securities of these issuers may provide that their holders are entitled to receive payments of interest or principal on or before the dates on which payments are to be made to the more subordinate securities held by the ZAIS Managed Entities. Also, in the event of a default or other credit event including, but not limited to, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy, holders of securities ranking senior to those held by the ZAIS Managed Entities may typically be entitled to receive payment in full before distributions are made to the ZAIS Managed Entities. After repaying senior security holders, the issuer of the securities held by the ZAIS Managed Entities may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying amounts owed to the securities held by the ZAIS Managed Entities. To the extent that any assets remain, holders of securities that rank equally with those securities held by the ZAIS Managed Entities would be entitled to share on an equal and ratable basis in distributions that are made out of those assets. Also, during periods of financial distress or following insolvency, the ability of the ZAIS Managed Entities to influence an issuer\u2019s affairs and to take actions to protect their investments may be substantially less than that of the senior security holders. Additionally, since ZAIS Group invests directly in certain ZAIS Managed Entities, ZAIS Group is subject to the same risks as the ZAIS Managed Entities disclosed herein.\nThird-party investors in certain of the ZAIS Managed Entities may not satisfy their contractual obligation to fund capital calls when requested, which could adversely affect a ZAIS Managed Entity\u2019s operations and performance.\nCertain of the ZAIS Managed Entities require investors to make capital commitments that ZAIS Group is entitled to call from those investors at any time during prescribed periods. At December 31, 2016 one ZAIS Managed Entity, which is consolidated in our December 31, 2016 financial statements and included in Item 8 herein, has uncalled capital commitments of approximately $59.8 million, which includes $30.5 million of uncalled capital applicable to ZAIS Group. In February 2017, ZAIS Group made a $5.0 million commitment to a ZAIS Managed Entity which focuses on investing in non-ZAIS managed CLOs, none of which has been called as of March 24, 2017.\nZAIS Group, as investment manager to these ZAIS Managed Entities, controls the capital call process, including when and if to call additional capital. ZAIS Group has historically depended on investors fulfilling and honoring their commitments when it calls capital from them in connection with making investments and otherwise paying obligations when due. Any investor that does not fund a capital call may be subject to several possible penalties. However, the impact of any such penalty is often directly correlated to the amount of capital previously invested by the investor in the ZAIS Managed Entity and if an investor has invested little or no capital, for instance early in the life of the ZAIS Managed Entity, then certain penalties may not be as meaningful. Investors may also negotiate for lesser or reduced penalties at the outset of the ZAIS Managed Entity, thereby limiting ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to enforce the funding of a capital call. Third-party investors in certain ZAIS Managed Entities often use distributions from prior investments to meet future capital calls. In cases where valuations of existing investments fall and the pace of distributions slows, investors may be unable to make new commitments to ZAIS Managed Entities or to meet existing commitments to the ZAIS Managed Entities. The failure of investors to honor a significant amount of capital calls for certain ZAIS Managed Entities could have a material adverse effect on the operation and performance of those ZAIS Managed Entities and, in turn, ZAIS Group\u2019s business.\nThe ZAIS Managed Entities may be forced to dispose of investments at a disadvantageous time.\nThe ZAIS Managed Entities may make investments that they cannot advantageously dispose of prior to the date the applicable ZAIS Managed Entity is dissolved or that they may be forced to dispose of at an inopportune time to meet an investor redemption request. Although ZAIS Group generally expects that investments will be disposed of prior to dissolution or be suitable for in-kind distribution at dissolution of a ZAIS Managed Entity, such ZAIS Managed Entity may have to sell, distribute or otherwise dispose of investments at a disadvantageous time as a result of its dissolution. This would result in a lower than expected return on the investments and, perhaps, on the ZAIS Managed Entity itself.\nHedging strategies may adversely affect the returns on the ZAIS Managed Entities\u2019 investments.\nZAIS Group uses various forward contracts, options, swaps (including total return swaps), caps, collars, floors, foreign currency forward contracts, currency swap agreements, currency option contracts or other instruments to manage the ZAIS Managed Entities\u2019 exposure to market risks. The success of any hedging or other derivative transactions generally depends on the degree of correlation between price movements of a derivative instrument and the position being hedged, the creditworthiness of the counterparty, the costs of the hedging transaction and other factors. Because the ZAIS Managed Entities may enter into transactions to hedge their exposure to market risks, while the transaction may reduce the risks of losses with respect to adverse movements in such market factors, the transaction may also limit the opportunity for gain if the value of the hedged positions increases. There can be no assurance that any hedging transaction will successfully hedge the risks associated with hedged positions or that it will not result in poorer overall investment performance than if it had not been executed.\nWhile such hedging arrangements may reduce certain risks, such arrangements themselves may entail certain other risks. These arrangements may require the posting of cash or other collateral at a time when a ZAIS Managed Entity has insufficient cash or illiquid assets such that the posting of the cash is either impossible or requires the sale of assets at prices that do not reflect their underlying value. Moreover, these hedging arrangements may generate significant transaction costs, including potential tax costs and legal fees, which may reduce the anticipated returns on an investment. Finally, the CFTC has indicated that it may soon issue a proposal for certain foreign exchange products to be subject to mandatory clearing, which could increase the costs of entering into currency hedges.\nZAIS Group\u2019s failure to appropriately address conflicts of interest could damage ZAIS Group\u2019s reputation and adversely affect ZAIS Group\u2019s businesses.\nZAIS Group continues to confront potential conflicts of interest relating to its investment activities on behalf of itself and the ZAIS Managed Entities. ZAIS Group serves as the investment adviser to a number of ZAIS Managed Entities, and may, in the future establish new ZAIS Managed Entities that will compete with one another and with ZAIS Group. Certain ZAIS Managed Entities have overlapping investment objectives and strategies, including different fee structures, and potential conflicts may arise with respect to ZAIS Group\u2019s decisions regarding how to allocate investment opportunities and shared expenses among those ZAIS Managed Entities. For example, a decision to receive material non-public information about a company or loan borrower while pursuing an investment opportunity for a particular ZAIS Managed Entity gives rise to a potential conflict of interest if it results in ZAIS Group\u2019s having to restrict the ability of other ZAIS Managed Entities to take any action with respect to such company.\nThere are also additional conflicts of interest that ZAIS Group encounters in managing the ZAIS Managed Entities. ZAIS Group may or may not cause a ZAIS Managed Entity to purchase different classes of securities that may have interests that conflict with the interests owned by another ZAIS Managed Entity. ZAIS Group or the ZAIS Managed Entities may hold similar positions or the same security, yet ZAIS Group may liquidate its position as circumstances warrant, potentially affecting the liquidity or value of the securities held by the other ZAIS Managed Entities. ZAIS Managed Entities may take conflicting positions with that of other ZAIS Managed Entities. For example, a ZAIS Managed Entity may take a long position while another ZAIS Managed Entity may take a short position in the same security. Additional conflicts may arise in circumstances where the ZAIS Managed Entities purchase from or sell assets to ZAIS or other ZAIS Managed Entities. Further, ZAIS Group or certain ZAIS Managed Entities may liquidate investments at different times than other ZAIS Managed Entities due to, among other things, differences in investment strategies or fund durations.\nIn addition to the various conflicts set forth above, conflicts of interest may exist in the valuation of ZAIS Managed Entities\u2019 investments and related to decisions about the allocation of specific investment opportunities among the ZAIS Managed Entities and the allocation of fees and costs among the ZAIS Managed Entities. Though ZAIS Group believes it has appropriate means to resolve these conflicts, ZAIS Group\u2019s judgment on any particular issue could be challenged. If ZAIS Group fails to appropriately address any such conflicts, it could negatively impact ZAIS Group\u2019s reputation and its ability to raise funds, may trigger redemptions by existing clients, may result in potential litigation against us or may result in a regulatory investigation related to our practices used to address such conflicts of interest.\nCertain of the ZAIS Managed Entities invest in RMBS that are subject to particular risks.\nAs of December 31, 2016, ZAIS Group served as investment manager to seven ZAIS Managed Entities investing a portion of their assets in RMBS with an aggregate fair market value of approximately $430.3 million.\nHolders of RMBS generally bear risks inherent in structured products. In particular, the rate of defaults and losses are affected by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, the unemployment rate, the level of interest rates, the availability of mortgage credit, local conditions in the geographic area where the related mortgaged property is located, the terms of the loan, the borrower\u2019s equity in the mortgaged property and the financial circumstances of the borrower. Further, a region\u2019s economic condition and housing market may be directly, or indirectly, adversely affected by natural disasters or civil disturbances such as earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, eruptions or riots. The above factors may have a larger effect depending on the composition and concentration of the residential mortgage loans. For example, subprime, non-conforming mortgage loans, balloon mortgage loans, interest only mortgage loans, adjustable-rate mortgage loans, and negatively amortizing mortgage loans may be subject to greater risks than traditional fixed rate mortgage loans.\nForeclosure. Residential mortgage foreclosure rates increased significantly in connection with the crisis in the credit markets that began in 2007 - 2008. This trend negatively impacted the financial and capital markets generally and the mortgage-lending and mortgage-investment industry segments more specifically. If a residential mortgage loan is in default, foreclosure of such residential mortgage loan may be a lengthy and difficult process, and may involve significant expenses. Furthermore, the market for defaulted residential mortgage loans or foreclosed properties may be very limited. In the event that a ZAIS Managed Entity invests in RMBS collateralized by residential mortgage loans that are subsequently foreclosed on, such ZAIS Managed Entity would likely lose some or all of its investment, which could have a material adverse effect on the its performance and profitability.\nUnderwriting. Defaults on residential mortgage loans underlying the RMBS may result from substandard underwriting and purchasing guidelines or the failure of the loan originator to comply with good or adequate origination guidelines. The applicable originator\u2019s underwriting standards and any applicable purchasing guidelines may not identify or appropriately assess the risk that the interest and principal payments due on a mortgage loan will be repaid when due, or at all, or whether the market value of the related mortgaged property is sufficient to otherwise provide for recovery of such amounts. In addition, with respect to any exceptions made to the applicable originator\u2019s underwriting standards in originating a mortgage loan, those exceptions may be subjective and may increase the risk that principal and interest amounts may not be received or recovered and compensating factors, if any, which may be the premise for making an exception to the underwriting standards may not, in fact, compensate for any additional risk. No assurance can be given that any of the mortgage loans underlying an RMBS owned by a ZAIS Managed Entity comply with an originator\u2019s underwriting guidelines or that any mortgage loans have compensating factors in the event that those mortgage loans do not comply with the related originator\u2019s underwriting guidelines. RMBS owned by the ZAIS Managed Entities may contain mortgage loans that may have been originated with less stringent underwriting guidelines than mortgage loans being originated in the current environment.\nPrepayment. The rate of prepayments of newly originated residential mortgage loans is sensitive to prevailing interest rates. Generally, if prevailing interest rates decline, mortgage prepayments may increase if refinancing is available at lower interest rates. If prevailing interest rates rise, prepayments on the mortgage loans may decrease. However, an expansion of credit could result in an increase in refinancing activity even in a rising interest rate environment if credit standards are relaxed and underwriting guidelines expanded. Prepayments also may occur as a result of solicitations of the borrowers by mortgage loan lenders. In addition, the timing of prepayments of principal may also be affected by liquidations of or insurance payments on the mortgage loan, or repurchases by the related originator for breaches of representations and warranties or defective documentation. An increase in prepayments has a negative effect on the value of mortgage loans purchased at a premium due to the loss of future interest payments.\nLegal/Regulatory. Ownership of residential mortgage loans also includes the potential of certain legal risks of ownership, including assignee liabilities. The Truth in Lending Act provides that subsequent purchasers of residential mortgage loans originated in violation of certain requirements specified in the Truth in Lending Act may have liability for such violations. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) also prohibits lenders from originating residential mortgage loans unless the lender determines that the borrower has a reasonable ability to repay the loan. This requirement has been codified in the \u201cability-to-repay\u201d rules (collectively, the \u201cATR Rules\u201d) under the Truth in Lending Act (\u201cRegulation Z\u201d). The ATR Rules, among other things, require that originators follow certain procedures and obtain certain documents in order to make a reasonable, good faith determination of a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a residential mortgage loan. In addition, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has issued regulations, which became effective January 2014, specifying the standards for a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d that would have the benefit of a safe harbor from liability under the ATR Rules if certain requirements are satisfied, or a rebuttable presumption of safety from such liability if only certain of these requirements are satisfied. Interest-only loans, hybrid mortgage loans and balloon loans, as well as loans with a debt-to-income ratio exceeding 43% in general do not constitute qualified mortgages. Possible liabilities that could be required to be paid by an assignee of a mortgage loan include actual damages suffered by the borrower, litigation costs (which could exceed the principal amount of a mortgage loan), statutory damages and special statutory damages. A borrower may also assert a violation of the ATR Rules as a defense in a foreclosure action. Various state and local legislatures may adopt similar or more onerous provisions in the future. In addition, the qualified mortgage rule may adversely affect the market generally for mortgage-backed securities, if investors are not willing to invest in pools of mortgage loans that do not satisfy the qualified mortgage requirement. Violations of these federal and state regulations may result in losses related to the related RMBS and may result in corresponding losses to the ZAIS Managed Entities holding such RMBS.\nThird Party Service Providers. Mortgage loans are subject to risks of loss related to the third party service providers such as loan servicers, including from violations of consumer protection laws, servicing protocols and servicing errors, including errors in the recordation of mortgage loans, or other factors that may cause foreclosure delays. Loan modifications by servicers may impact the value of mortgage loans.\nCertain of the ZAIS Managed Entities invest in commercial mortgage and related assets that are subject to particular risks.\nCertain of the ZAIS Managed Entities invest in a variety of assets backed by commercial mortgages including collateralized mortgage backed securities (\u201cCMBS\u201d), commercial real estate mortgages and mezzanine loans and direct commercial property ownership. As of December 31, 2016, ZAIS Group served as an investment manager to four ZAIS Managed Entities investing a portion of their assets in CMBS, commercial real estate mortgages, mezzanine loans and direct commercial property ownership with an aggregate fair market value of approximately $47.0 million.\nThe values of the commercial mortgage loans and the assets backed by commercial mortgages are influenced by the rate of delinquencies and defaults experienced on the commercial mortgage loans and by the severity of loss incurred as result of such defaults. The factors influencing delinquencies, defaults and loss severity include: (i) economic and real estate market conditions by industry sectors (e.g., multifamily, retail, office, etc.); (ii) the terms and structure of the mortgage loans; and (iii) any specific limits to legal and financial recourse upon a default under the terms of the mortgage loan.\nExercise of foreclosure and other remedies may involve lengthy delays and additional legal and other related expenses on top of potentially declining property values. In certain circumstances, the creditors may also become liable upon taking title to an asset for environmental or structural damage existing at the property.\nCommercial mortgage loans have a risk of loss through delinquency and foreclosure. The ability of a borrower to repay a loan secured by income-producing property typically is dependent primarily upon the successful operation and operating income of such property (i.e., the ability of tenants to make lease payments, the ability of a property to attract and retain tenants, and the ability of the owner to maintain the property, minimize operating expenses and comply with applicable zoning and other laws) rather than upon the existence of independent income or assets of the borrower. Many commercial mortgage loans provide recourse only to specific assets, such as the property, and not against the borrower's other assets or personal guarantees.\nCommercial mortgage loans generally do not fully amortize, which can necessitate a sale of the property or refinancing of the remaining \u201cballoon\u201d amount at or prior to maturity of the mortgage loan. Accordingly, investors in commercial mortgage loans and CMBS bear the risk that the borrower will be unable to refinance or otherwise repay the mortgage at maturity, thereby increasing the likelihood of a default on the borrower's obligation.\nThe repayment of a commercial mortgage loan is typically dependent upon the ability of the related mortgaged property to produce cash flow through the collection of rents. Even the liquidation value of a commercial property is determined, in substantial part, by the amount of the mortgaged property\u2019s cash flow (or its potential to generate cash flow). However, net operating income and cash flow are often based on assumptions regarding tenant behavior and market conditions. Net operating income and cash flow can be volatile over time and may be insufficient to cover debt service on the mortgage loan at any given time. Lenders typically look to the debt service coverage ratio (that is, the ratio of net cash flow to debt service) of a mortgage loan secured by income-producing property as an important measure of the risk of default of that mortgage loan.\nThe net operating income, cash flow and property value of a commercial mortgage property may be adversely affected by a large number of factors specific to the property, such as:\n\u2022 the age, design and construction quality of the mortgage property;\n\u2022 perceptions regarding the safety, convenience and attractiveness of the mortgaged property;\n\u2022 the characteristics of the neighborhood where the mortgaged property is located;\n\u2022 the proximity and attractiveness of competing properties;\n\u2022 the adequacy of the mortgaged property\u2019s management and maintenance;\n\u2022 increases in interest rates, real estate taxes and other operating expenses at the mortgaged property and in relation to competing properties;\n\u2022 an increase in the capital expenditures needed to maintain the mortgaged property or make improvements;\n\u2022 the dependence upon a single tenant, or a concentration of tenants, at the mortgaged property in a particular business or industry;\n\u2022 a decline in the financial condition of a major tenant at the mortgaged property;\n\u2022 an increase in vacancy rates for the applicable property type in the relevant geographic area;\n\u2022 a decline in rental rates as leases are renewed or entered into with new tenants;\n\u2022 national, regional or local economic conditions (including plant closings, military base closings, industry slowdowns and unemployment rates);\n\u2022 local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of competing properties, space, multifamily housing, manufactured housing or hotel capacity);\n\u2022 natural disasters or civil disturbances such as earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, eruptions or riots;\n\u2022 the length of tenant leases (including that in certain cases, all or substantially all of the tenants, or one or more sole, anchor or other tenants, at a particular mortgaged property have leases that expire or permit the tenant(s) to terminate its or their lease(s) during the term of the related mortgage loan) and other lease terms, including co-tenancy provisions;\n\u2022 the creditworthiness of tenants;\n\u2022 tenant defaults;\n\u2022 in the case of rental properties, the rate at which vacant space or space under expiring leases is re-let; and\n\u2022 the mortgaged property\u2019s \u201coperating leverage\u201d (i.e., the percentage of total property expenses in relation to revenue, the ratio of fixed operating expenses to those that vary with revenues, and the level of capital expenditures required to maintain the property and to retain or replace tenants).\nA decline in the real estate market or in the financial condition of a major tenant tends to have a more immediate effect on the net operating income of mortgaged properties with short-term revenue sources, such as short-term or month-to-month leases or leases with termination options, and may lead to higher rates of delinquency or defaults under the related mortgage loans.\nIn addition, underwritten or adjusted cash flows, by their nature, are speculative and are based upon certain assumptions and projections, including with respect to matters such as tenancy and rental income. Any variance of these assumptions or projections, in whole or in part, could cause the underwritten or adjusted cash flows to vary substantially from the actual cash flows of a mortgaged property.\nCertain of the ZAIS Managed Entities invest in structured finance securities that are subject to particular risks.\nCertain of the ZAIS Managed Entities invest in structured finance securities, including CLOs, credit default swaps, interest only and inverse interest only securities, synthetic risk transfer securities, securities backed by manufactured housing loans and other asset backed securities that are subject to particular risks, including:\n\u2022 Insolvency considerations with respect to issuers of securitized products;\n\u2022 Control rights and the intentions of the parties holding such control rights;\n\u2022 Uninvested cash balances may limit returns, thereby possibly limiting amounts available for distribution to the security holders;\n\u2022 The performance of structured finance securities are heavily dependent on the decisions of the manager of the securities;\n\u2022 Action by a rating agency may affect the performance of a structured finance security;\n\u2022 Optional or mandatory redemptions by holders of senior or mezzanine tranches of securities may affect the performance and life of the securities;\n\u2022 Limited information is available with respect to the collateral of these structured finance securities;\n\u2022 Certain structured finance securities may contain covenant lite loans which carry additional risks;\n\u2022 The restructuring of the government sponsored entities could impact the performance of securities guaranteed by such agencies; and\n\u2022 Structured finance securities often contain conflicts of interests between their manager and the owners of certain classes of the issuer\u2019s securities.\nCertain of the ZAIS Managed Entities invest in leveraged loans that are subject to particular risks.\nCertain of the ZAIS Managed Entities invest in leveraged loans, either directly, or through securities backed by leveraged loans, including CLOs. Additionally, ZAIS Group invests in ZAIS Managed Entities that invest in the equity tranches of CLOs which provides exposure to leveraged loans. Further, the recently adopted European and United States risk retention requirements, require ZAIS Group to invest in a percentage of the debt or equity tranches of the CLOs (and therefore leveraged loans) it manages. Currently, ZAIS Group has met this requirement through its investment in a majority owned affiliate of ZAIS Group that invests in the debt and equity tranches of certain CLOs for which ZAIS Group serves as the collateral manager. Leveraged loans may be risky and investors in these types of investments could lose some or all of their principal.\nLeveraged loans may experience volatility in the price that is paid on such leveraged loans. Such prices vary based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of supply and demand in the leveraged loan market, general economic conditions, levels of relative liquidity for leveraged loans, the actual and perceived level of credit risk in the leveraged loan market, regulatory changes, changes in credit ratings and the methodology used by credit rating agencies in assigning credit ratings, and such other factors that may affect pricing in the leveraged loan market. Since leveraged loans may generally be prepaid at any time without penalty, the obligors of such leveraged loans would be expected to prepay or refinance such leveraged loans if alternative financing were available at a lower cost. For example, if the credit ratings of an obligor were upgraded, the obligor were recapitalized or if credit spreads were declining for leveraged loans, such obligor would likely seek to refinance at a lower credit spread. The rates at which leveraged loans may prepay or refinance and the level of credit spreads for leveraged loans in the future are subject to numerous factors and are difficult to predict. Declining credit spreads in the leveraged loan market and increasing rates of prepayments and refinancings are likely to result in a reduction of portfolio yield and interest collections on leveraged loans owned by the ZAIS Managed Entities.\nLeveraged loans have historically experienced greater default rates than investment grade securities and loans. A non-investment grade loan or debt obligation or an interest in a non-investment grade loan is generally considered speculative in nature and may default for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022 Some of the borrowers have relatively short or no operating histories. These companies are and will be subject to all of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business enterprise, including the risk that these companies may not reach their investment objective and the value of a ZAIS Managed Entity\u2019s investment in them may decline substantially.\n\u2022 The borrower companies may be unable to meet their obligations under the securities held by the ZAIS Managed Entities, which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of the securities holding these leverage loans or of any collateral with respect to any securities and a reduction in the likelihood of the ZAIS Managed Entities realizing on any guarantees they may have obtained in connection with their investment.\n\u2022 Because many of the obligors on leveraged loans are privately held companies, public information is generally not available about these companies. The ZAIS Managed Entities depend partially on obtaining adequate information to evaluate these companies in making investment decisions from biased parties including the lead underwriter(s) and the borrowers, themselves.\n\u2022 Many of these borrowers have substantial financial leverage which may make it difficult for them to access the capital markets to meet future capital needs. The high leverage also makes operating results less predictable and may affect their competitiveness, which could affect their ability to repay their loans.\n\u2022 Most of the ZAIS Managed Entities\u2019 leveraged borrowers borrow money at floating spreads tied to LIBOR. When LIBOR rises, their total interest costs increase and their interest coverage ratios drop which can cause liquidity issues which may lead to a payment default.\n\u2022 A portfolio company's failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by the ZAIS Managed Entities or other lenders could lead to defaults and, potentially, termination of its loans and foreclosure on its secured assets, which could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements and jeopardize a portfolio company's ability to meet its obligations under the debt securities that the ZAIS Managed Entities hold. The ZAIS Managed Entities may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms, which may include the waiver of certain financial covenants, with a defaulting portfolio company.\nUpon any loan becoming a defaulted asset, such defaulted asset may become subject to either substantial workout negotiations or restructuring, which may entail, among other things, a substantial reduction in the interest rate, a substantial write-down of principal, and a substantial change in the terms, conditions and covenants with respect to such defaulted asset. In addition, such negotiations or restructuring may be quite extensive and protracted over time, and therefore may result in substantial uncertainty with respect to the ultimate recovery on such defaulted asset. The liquidity for defaulted assets may be limited, and to the extent that defaulted assets are sold, it is highly unlikely that the proceeds from such sale will be equal to the amount of unpaid principal and interest thereon.\nLoans and interests in loans have significant liquidity and market value risks since they are not generally traded in organized exchange markets but are traded by banks and other institutional investors engaged in loan syndications. Because loans are privately syndicated and loan agreements are privately negotiated and customized, loans are not purchased or sold as easily as publicly traded securities. A portion of these investments may be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale, transfer, pledge or other disposition or may otherwise be less liquid than publicly traded securities. In addition, historically the trading volume in the loan market has been small relative to the high-yield debt securities market. Depending upon market conditions, there may be a very limited market for leveraged loans. Non-investment grade loans are often issued in connection with leveraged acquisitions in which the issuers incur a substantially higher amount of indebtedness than the level at which they had previously operated. The lower rating of non-investment grade loans reflects a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of the obligor or general economic conditions (including, for example, a substantial period of rising interest rates or declining earnings or disruptions in the financial markets) or both may impair the ability of the obligor to make payments of principal and interest.\nCertain of the ZAIS Managed Entities invest in credit default swaps and other synthetic securities that are subject to particular risks.\nZAIS Managed Entities may also enter into derivative transactions that have the effect of creating a \u201csynthetic security\u201d - that is, the artificial creation of an asset using combinations of other assets, at least some of which derive their value from one or more reference obligations - or invest in an entity whose assets consist of one or more \u201cpre-packaged\u201d synthetic securities. The use of synthetic securities presents risks in addition to those resulting from direct purchases of the reference obligations. Synthetic securities can frequently be created at a much lower net cost than would be incurred by purchasing (or selling short) the reference asset (or assets) but produce returns or losses that mirror the returns or losses of the reference asset (or assets), which has a leveraging effect that can produce high gains, but also high losses, in relation to the amount invested. While one or more components of a synthetic security may be exchange traded or cleared (such as futures contracts, or options on futures contracts, traded on a commodities exchange or cleared swaps), in many cases a synthetic security is created using over-the-counter transactions. When a synthetic security is created using over-the-counter transactions, the person creating the synthetic security (the \u201cowner\u201d) usually has one or more contractual relationships (typically in the form of swaps) only with counterparties with respect to the components of the synthetic security, and not with the obligor on the reference obligation. The owner generally has no right directly to enforce compliance by the reference obligor with the terms of the reference obligation or any rights of set-off against the reference obligor, nor does the owner generally have any voting or other consensual rights of ownership with respect to the reference obligation. ZAIS Managed Entities that establish synthetic security positions, or invest in entities that have established synthetic security positions, do not directly benefit from any collateral supporting the reference obligation and do not have the benefit of the remedies that would normally be available to a holder of a reference obligation. In addition, in the event of the insolvency of a counterparty to one or more of the components of the synthetic security, the owner of the synthetic security may be treated as a general creditor of the counterparty, and generally has no claim of title with respect to the reference obligation. Consequently, ZAIS Managed Entities that utilize synthetic securities would be subject to the credit risk of the counterparty as well as that of the reference obligor. As a result, concentrations of synthetic security positions with any one counterparty may subject ZAIS Managed Entities to additional risk with respect to defaults by such a counterparty as well as by the reference obligor.\nThrough their use of synthetic securities, ZAIS Managed Entities are exposed to the risks related to the reference obligations of such synthetic securities. The market value of a reference obligation generally fluctuates with, among other things, changes in prevailing interest rates, general economic conditions, the condition of certain financial markets, international political events, developments or trends in any particular industry, the financial condition of the reference obligor (and the obligors of the securitized assets underlying a reference obligation that is collateral security) and the terms of the reference obligation. Adverse changes in the financial condition of reference obligors (and, if the reference obligor is an ABS issuer, of the obligors of the securitized assets underlying an ABS), general economic conditions or both may result in a decline in the market value of a reference obligation. In addition, future periods of uncertainty in the United States economy and the economies of other countries in which reference obligors (and the obligors of the securitized assets underlying an asset backed security) are domiciled and the possibility of increased volatility and default rates may also adversely affect the price and liquidity of reference obligations.\nMany reference obligations have no, or only a limited, trading market. Trading in fixed income securities in general, including ABS and related derivatives, often takes place primarily in over-the-counter markets consisting of groups of dealer firms that are typically major securities firms. Because the market for certain ABS and related derivatives is a dealer market, rather than an auction market, no single obtainable price for a given instrument prevails at any given time. Not all dealers maintain markets in these securities at all times. The illiquidity of reference obligations can restrict the ability of ZAIS Group or the ZAIS Managed Entities to take advantage of market opportunities. Illiquid reference obligations may trade at a discount from comparable, more liquid investments. In addition, reference obligations may include privately placed securities that may or may not be freely transferable under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction or due to contractual restrictions on resale, and even if such privately placed securities are transferable, the value of such reference obligations could be less than what may be considered the fair value of such securities.\nZAIS Group depends on its senior management team, senior investment professionals and other key personnel, and its ability to retain them and attract additional qualified personnel is critical to its success and growth prospects.\n\u2022 ZAIS Group depends on the diligence, skill, judgment, business contacts and personal reputations of its senior management team, including Christian Zugel, its Chief Investment Officer, Michael Szymanski, its President and Chief Executive Officer, Nisha Motani, its Chief Accounting Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer, various senior investment professionals and other key personnel. ZAIS Group\u2019s future success depends upon its ability to retain its senior professionals and other key personnel and its ability to recruit additional qualified personnel. These individuals possess substantial experience and expertise in investing, are responsible for locating and executing investments on behalf of the ZAIS Managed Entities, have significant relationships with the institutions that are the sources of many of the investment opportunities for the ZAIS Managed Entities and, in certain cases, have strong relationships with the investors in the ZAIS Managed Entities. Therefore, if any of ZAIS Group\u2019s senior investment professionals or other key personnel join competitors or form competing companies, it could result in the loss of significant investment opportunities and certain existing investors.\n\u2022 The departure for any reason of any of ZAIS Group\u2019s senior professionals could have a material adverse effect on its ability to achieve its investment objectives, cause certain of its investors to withdraw capital they have invested or committed to the ZAIS Managed Entities, elect not to commit additional capital to the ZAIS Managed Entities or otherwise have a material adverse effect on ZAIS Group\u2019s business and its prospects. The departure of some or all of those individuals, including ZAIS Group\u2019s Chief Investment Officer, Christian Zugel, could also trigger certain \u201ckey man\u201d provisions in the documentation governing certain ZAIS Managed Entities, which would permit the investors in those entities to withdraw their capital.\n\u2022 The market for qualified investment professionals is extremely competitive and ZAIS Group may not succeed in recruiting personnel or it may fail to effectively replace current personnel who depart with qualified or effective successors. ZAIS Group\u2019s efforts to retain and attract its professionals may also result in significant additional expenses, which could adversely affect ZAIS Group\u2019s profitability.\n\u2022 Many of the members of ZAIS Group\u2019s senior management team and ZAIS Group\u2019s senior investment professionals have entered into non-competition agreements with ZAIS Group. There is no guarantee that these individuals will not resign, join ZAIS Group\u2019s competitors or form a competing company, or that the non-competition provisions in these agreements would be upheld by a court. If any of these events were to occur, ZAIS Group\u2019s business would be materially adversely affected.\n\u2022\nIn addition to reduced levels of incentive compensation for most employees in recent years, any future decreases in levels of incentive compensation paid to employees due to the Company\u2019s financial results could have a material adverse effect on ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to retain or recruit personnel, including senior managers, investment professionals, key personnel and other employees, which could reduce its profitability and growth.\nRisk Factors Related to Future Growth\nIf ZAIS Group is unable to execute development opportunities, it may not be able to implement its growth strategy successfully.\nZAIS Group\u2019s growth strategy includes the expansion of certain of ZAIS Group\u2019s existing businesses, as well as the development and implementation of new business opportunities. It also encompasses funding of risk retention vehicles to comply with new risk retention rules for CLO issuers. The success of these growth initiatives depends on, among other things: (a) the availability of suitable opportunities, (b) the level of competition from other companies that may have greater financial resources, (c) ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to value potential development accurately and negotiate acceptable terms for those opportunities, (d) ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to obtain requisite approvals and licenses from the relevant governmental authorities and to comply with applicable laws and regulations without incurring undue costs and delays, (e) ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to identify and enter into mutually beneficial relationships with service providers and counterparties and (f) ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to properly manage conflicts of interest. If ZAIS Group is not successful in implementing its growth strategy, its business, results of operations and the market price for our Class A Common Stock may be adversely affected.\nThe Company continually reviews its business and fund activities with a view towards improving our profitability. As a result of concluding that a planned expansion in our capabilities in the residential whole loan market would no longer be a part of our future strategy, a reduction in expenses related to infrastructure staffing was made by completing a reduction in force on March 8, 2016 which resulted in a decrease of 23 employees of ZAIS Group. This reduction is expected to result in an annualized run rate savings of approximately $3.5 million in base compensation and benefits. Total severance charges in the amount of approximately $1.0 million were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016. On October 31, 2016, the Company\u2019s management agreement with ZFC REIT was terminated upon completion of the merger between ZFC REIT and Sutherland Asset Management Corp which resulted in a decrease of $0.589 billion to ZAIS Group\u2019s AUM during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016. In addition, management fees earned by ZAIS Group are expected to decrease by approximately $2.8 million annually on a run-rate basis. The decrease in management fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 was offset by the receipt of a termination payment in the amount of $8.0 million. On February 15, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company established a Special Committee of independent and disinterested directors to consider any proposals by management or third parties for strategic transactions. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors has been undertaking a strategic review of the Company\u2019s business in order to enhance shareholder value, and has engaged a financial advisor for this purpose. Various alternatives have been and are being considered, including a possible sale or combination or other similar transaction, or a going private transaction which would result in the termination of the registration of our Class A Shares so as to cease periodic and other public company compliance and reporting. The Company has received from and provided to potential counterparties certain due diligence information. In addition, the Company\u2019s management and financial advisor have held and expect to continue to hold preliminary discussions with potential counterparties and participants. There is no assurance that any of the preliminary discussions which have taken place or may in the future take place will result in any transaction or that any of the strategic alternatives under consideration will be implemented. The Company does not intend to provide periodic public updates of these matters except as required by law or regulation.\nZAIS Group may enter into new businesses, make future strategic investments or acquisitions, enter into joint ventures and invest its own capital, each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties in ZAIS Group\u2019s business.\nZAIS Group seeks to grow its business by increasing AUM in existing businesses, creating new investment products and, potentially, adding new product lines. ZAIS Group may pursue growth through strategic investments, including opportunities that may arise for ZAIS Group to acquire other alternative or traditional asset managers. To the extent ZAIS Group makes strategic investments or acquisitions, enters into joint ventures, enters into a new line of business or invests its own capital, ZAIS Group will face numerous risks and uncertainties, including risks associated with (i) committing resources, (ii) the possibility that ZAIS Group has insufficient expertise to engage in such activities profitably or without incurring inappropriate amounts of risk, (iii) combining or integrating operational and management systems and controls and (iv) risk of loss associated with investing its capital. To the extent that ZAIS Group invests its own capital, it will be subject to many of the risks described herein relating to the ZAIS Managed Entities. ZAIS Group\u2019s investments may not be diversified, thereby increasing the risk of loss associated with certain of the investments ZAIS Group makes. Entry into certain lines of business may subject ZAIS Group to new laws and regulations with which it is not familiar, or from which ZAIS Group is currently exempt, and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk. If a new business generates insufficient revenues or if ZAIS Group is unable to efficiently manage its expanded operations, our results of operations will be adversely affected. In the case of joint ventures, we will be subject to additional risks and uncertainties in that ZAIS Group may be dependent upon, and subject to liability, losses or reputational damage relating to, systems, controls and personnel that are not under our control.\nZAIS Group may use third-party distribution sources to market certain ZAIS Managed Entities and strategies, including ZAIS Group\u2019s CLO management business.\nZAIS Group\u2019s ability to grow its AUM is partially dependent on third-party intermediaries, including investment banks, solicitation agents and broker-dealers. No assurance can be made that these intermediaries will be accessible to ZAIS Group on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, pension fund consultants and other investment management consultants may review and evaluate ZAIS Group and its institutional products from time to time. Poor reviews or evaluations of either a particular product, or of ZAIS Group, may result in institutional client withdrawals or may impair ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to attract new assets through these consultants.\nZAIS Group\u2019s business depends in large part on its ability to raise capital from investors in the ZAIS Managed Entities. If ZAIS Group is unable to raise such capital, it would be unable to collect management fees, which would materially and adversely affect ZAIS Group\u2019s business and our results of operations and financial condition.\nZAIS has experienced challenges in raising significant new capital since the financial crisis in 2008 and more recently in the environment of lower interest rates and challenging regulation. Structured credit products have been disfavored by many investors, and European investors have generally reduced investments in certain securitized investment vehicles due to increased regulatory requirements. ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to raise capital from investors depends on a number of factors, including many that are outside of its control. Investors may downsize their investment allocations to rebalance a disproportionate weighting of their overall investment portfolio among asset classes. In the event of poor performance of the ZAIS Managed Entities, it could be more difficult for ZAIS Group to raise new capital. ZAIS Group\u2019s investors and potential investors continually assess the performance of the ZAIS Managed Entities independently, relative to market benchmarks and relative to ZAIS Group\u2019s competitors. ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to raise capital for existing and future ZAIS Managed Entities, including new CLO securitizations, depends in part, on the performance of the ZAIS Managed Entities. If economic and market conditions deteriorate, ZAIS Group may be unable to raise sufficient amounts of capital to support the investment activities of future ZAIS Managed Entities. If ZAIS Group is unable to successfully raise capital, ZAIS Group\u2019s business and our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nZAIS Group\u2019s existing businesses combined with any new business initiatives may place significant demands on ZAIS Group\u2019s administrative, operational and financial resources.\nZAIS Group\u2019s current business places significant demands on its legal, compliance, accounting and operational infrastructure. The number of employees in these disciplines has declined from 50 at December 31, 2015 to 31 at March 24, 2017, which could present significant challenges in supporting the operational needs of ZAIS Group going forward. Any new business initiatives that ZAIS Group effectuates would likely increase the demands placed on ZAIS Group and will result in increased expenses. In addition, ZAIS Group is required to continuously develop its systems and infrastructure in response to the increasing sophistication of the investment management market and legal, accounting, regulatory and tax developments. Any future ZAIS Group initiatives will depend in part on, ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to maintain an operating platform and management system sufficient to support such new initiatives and will require ZAIS Group to incur significant additional expenses and to commit additional senior management and operational resources. As a result, ZAIS Group faces significant challenges, including:\n\u2022 maintaining adequate financial, regulatory (legal, tax and compliance) and business controls;\n\u2022 implementing new or updated information and financial systems and procedures;\n\u2022 training, managing and appropriately sizing ZAIS Group\u2019s work force and other components of ZAIS Group\u2019s businesses on a timely and cost-effective basis;\n\u2022 mitigating the diversion of management\u2019s attention from ZAIS Group\u2019s core businesses;\n\u2022 reducing the disruption of ZAIS Group\u2019s ongoing business;\n\u2022 entering into markets or lines of business in which ZAIS Group may have limited or no experience;\n\u2022 maintaining the required investment of capital and other resources; and\n\u2022 complying with additional regulatory requirements.\nEntry into certain lines of business may subject ZAIS Group to new laws and regulations with which it is not familiar, or from which it is currently exempt, and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory enforcement risk. If a new business does not generate sufficient revenues or if ZAIS Group is unable to efficiently manage ZAIS Group\u2019s expanded operations, ZAIS Group\u2019s results of operations will be adversely affected. ZAIS Group\u2019s strategic initiatives may include joint ventures, in which case it will be subject to additional risks and uncertainties in that it may be dependent upon, and subject to liability, losses or reputational damage relating to systems, controls and personnel that are not under ZAIS Group\u2019s control. We cannot identify all the risks we may face and the potential adverse consequences on ZAIS Group and any investment that may result from any attempted expansion.\nCertain of ZAIS Group\u2019s initiatives may be effectuated through seed investments in ZAIS Managed Entities and finding additional investors in such ZAIS Managed Entities may be difficult.\nCertain of ZAIS Group\u2019s initiatives may be effectuated through seed investments in ZAIS Managed Entities. ZAIS Group has already made two such investments, an investment in a ZAIS Managed Entity focused on investing in equity tranches of CLOs for which ZAIS Group serves as the investment manager and an equity investment in the first-loss equity tranche of a ZAIS Managed Entity focused on investing in high-yield bonds. Additionally, subsequent to December 31, 2016, ZAIS Group has made a $5.0 million commitment to a ZAIS Managed Entity which focuses on investing in non-ZAIS managed CLOs, none of which has been called as of March 24, 2017.\nAs a seed investor, ZAIS Group may bear a disproportionate share of startup expenses related to the formation of a ZAIS Managed Entity. It may be difficult for ZAIS Group to attract additional investors to these newly formed ZAIS Managed Entities and it may never be successful in finding additional investors to invest in such ZAIS Managed Entities. In such cases, the amount of investable capital would be constrained to the amount of capital invested in the ZAIS Managed Entity by ZAIS Group and the ZAIS Managed Entity may not be able to achieve the diversification or level of investments optimal to achieve the desired investment portfolio. Additionally, ZAIS Group may invest funds in a strategy in which it has little or no track record as an investment manager.\nThe market for securitization products may not grow or expand, which could result in limitations on ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to effectuate certain of ZAIS Group\u2019s strategies.\nThe market for securitization products may not grow or expand, which could limit ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to effectuate certain of its strategies, including its CLO related strategies. Certain of ZAIS Group\u2019s initiatives rely on ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to establish and market interests in ZAIS Managed Entities that purchase and securitize assets. If the market for securitization does not increase, ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to effectuate certain of its initiatives dependent on securitization may not be achievable.\nZAIS Group may in the future engage in certain market making activities that would require ZAIS Group or one of its subsidiaries to become a registered swap dealer or security-based swap dealer, which would result in significantly increased compliance and operational burdens.\nZAIS Group may decide to engage in certain market making activities that would require ZAIS Group or one of its subsidiaries to become a registered swap dealer or security-based swap dealer, which would result in a significantly increased compliance and operational burden. The Commodity Exchange Act (\u201cCEA\u201d), the Exchange Act and related regulations impose, or will impose, significant compliance requirements on swap dealers and security-based swap dealers in a number of areas, including capital and margin, reporting and recordkeeping, daily trading records, business conduct standards, documentation standards, monitoring of trading, risk management procedures, disclosure of information, ability to obtain information, conflicts of interest and segregation of collateral. Firms that wish to register as a swap dealer or a security-based swap dealer must have adequate documentation to support their compliance with these requirements, which could result in significant additional compliance and operational burdens on ZAIS Group. Any failure to comply with these rules, if applicable, could subject ZAIS Group to regulatory action or result in reputational harm and could affect the value of Class A Common Stock.\nAn increase in interest rates may have an impact on ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to pursue certain of ZAIS Group\u2019s growth initiatives.\nRising interest rates generally reduce the demand for mortgage loans due to the higher cost of borrowing and increase the expected duration and weighted average of life of existing RMBS, CMBS and the underlying mortgage loans. A reduction in the volume of mortgage loans originated may affect the volume of assets available to purchase as part of certain ZAIS Group\u2019s strategies related to residential and commercial mortgage related assets. Rising interest rates may also cause assets that were issued prior to an interest rate increase to provide yields that are below prevailing market interest rates. If rising interest rates cause ZAIS Group to be unable to acquire a sufficient volume of these mortgage related assets with a yield that is above ZAIS Group\u2019s borrowing costs, ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to satisfy certain of its initiatives and to generate income may be materially and adversely affected. The relationship between short-term and longer-term interest rates is often referred to as the \u201cyield curve.\u201d Ordinarily, short-term interest rates are lower than longer-term interest rates. If short-term interest rates rise disproportionately relative to longer-term interest rates (a flattening of the yield curve), ZAIS Group\u2019s borrowing costs may increase more rapidly than the interest income earned on ZAIS Group\u2019s assets. Because ZAIS Group expects its investments, on average, generally will bear interest based on longer-term rates rather than its borrowings, a flattening of the yield curve would tend to decrease ZAIS Group\u2019s net income and the market value of its net assets. To the extent that ZAIS Group has purchased assets with long durations using short term borrowings, it may need to liquidate such assets at unfavorable prices if long-term funding or other sources of funds are unavailable. Additionally, to the extent cash flows from investments that return scheduled and unscheduled principal are reinvested, the spread between the yields on the new investments and available borrowing rates may decline, which would likely decrease ZAIS Group\u2019s net income. It is also possible that short-term interest rates may exceed longer-term interest rates (a yield curve inversion), in which event ZAIS Group\u2019s borrowing costs may exceed ZAIS Group\u2019s interest income and it could incur operating losses.\nThe current interest rate environment negatively impacts ZAIS Group\u2019s business and may continue to do so.\nThe United States financial markets have been experiencing a period of historically low interest rates which make it more difficult for the ZAIS Managed Entities to earn returns that investors may find attractive. Lower returns make it more difficult for ZAIS Group to attract new investors or increase investments from existing investors in the ZAIS Managed Entities, resulting in reduced assets under management on which ZAIS Group earns management fees and a reduced potential to earn incentive fees. Additionally, lower returns are less attractive to investors, resulting in the increased potential for investor redemptions.\nIn addition, certain of the ZAIS Managed Entities have acquired assets that would traditionally be securitized into structured finance securities. In this low interest rate environment, the senior securities issued by certain of these securitization transactions have become unattractive to traditional buyers of these senior securities. The lack of market participants for certain of these securities may have additional negative impact on the ZAIS Managed Entities, and in turn, ZAIS Group\u2019s profitability.\nRisks Related to ZAIS Group\u2019s Regulatory Environment\nExtensive regulation affects ZAIS Group\u2019s activities, increases the cost of doing business and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties that could adversely affect ZAIS Group\u2019s business and results of operations.\nZAIS Group\u2019s business is subject to extensive regulation, including periodic examination, by governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which it operates. The SEC oversees ZAIS Group\u2019s activities as a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\u201cAdvisers Act\u201d). The National Futures Association (the \u201cNFA\u201d) and the CFTC oversee ZAIS Group\u2019s activities as a CPO and a CTA. In addition, ZAIS Group regularly relies on exemptions from various requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the 1940 Act, the CEA and ERISA. These exemptions are sometimes highly complex and may in certain circumstances depend on compliance by third parties whom ZAIS Group does not control. If for any reason these exemptions were to be revoked or challenged or otherwise become unavailable to ZAIS Group, ZAIS Group could become subject to regulatory enforcement action or third-party claims, which could have a material adverse effect on ZAIS Group\u2019s business.\nThe SEC has indicated that investment advisers who pay personnel transaction-based compensation for soliciting investments in the funds they advise, or who employ personnel solely responsible for marketing interests in the funds they advise, may be required to register as a broker-dealer or to arrange for those personnel to be registered representatives of a separate broker-dealer. ZAIS Group does not believe it or its personnel are required to so register. Additionally, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d) has adopted a new \u201cCapital Acquisition Broker\u201d category of firms set to become effective on April 14, 2017. If ZAIS Group were found to be subject to these rules, ZAIS Group would be subject to potentially substantial additional compliance obligations, which would further tax its compliance resources and may result in the need to hire additional personnel. No assurance can be made that new regulations, or new interpretations of existing regulations, will not result in ZAIS Group being required to register as a broker-dealer or its personnel to become registered representatives.\nSince 2010, states and other regulatory authorities have begun to require certain investment managers to register as lobbyists in connection with the solicitation of investments by public entities. ZAIS Group has registered as such in certain jurisdictions where required. Other states or municipalities may consider similar legislation or adopt regulations or procedures with similar effect. These registration requirements impose significant compliance obligations on registered lobbyists and their employers, which may include annual registration fees, periodic disclosure reports and internal recordkeeping, and may also prohibit the payment of contingent fees.\nEach of the regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over ZAIS Group has regulatory powers dealing with many aspects of financial services, including the authority to grant, and in specific circumstances to cancel, permissions to carry on or be compensated for particular activities. A failure to comply with the obligations imposed by the federal securities laws, including the SEC\u2019s rules under the Advisers Act and the CFTC\u2019s and NFA\u2019s rules under the CEA relating to recordkeeping, privacy, advertising and operating requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities, could result in investigations, sanctions and reputational damage. ZAIS Group is involved regularly in trading activities that implicate both U.S. securities and commodities law regimes, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and technical trading requirements that relate to fundamental market regulation policies. Violation of these laws could result in severe restrictions on ZAIS Group\u2019s activities and damage to ZAIS Group\u2019s reputation.\nFurthermore, the ZAIS Managed Entities generally rely on exemptions from investment company status under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d), and ZAIS Group is responsible for seeing to it that the ZAIS Managed Entities comply with the conditions that apply to those exemptions, both at inception and on an ongoing basis. If the conditions that govern such an exemption were violated and no other exemption was available to a ZAIS Managed Entity, it generally could not carry on its business unless it registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, which would subject that ZAIS Managed Entity to complex governance and operational requirements, restrictions and prohibitions that could make it undesirable or infeasible for that ZAIS Managed Entity to continue in business. In addition, such a failure by a ZAIS Managed Entity to qualify for an investment company status exemption could be attributed to ZAIS Group.\nZAIS Group\u2019s failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, censure, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions, including revocation of the registration of ZAIS Group\u2019s and its relevant subsidiaries as investment advisers, CTAs or CPOs. The regulations to which ZAIS Group\u2019s businesses are subject are designed primarily to protect investors in the ZAIS Managed Entities and to ensure the integrity of the financial markets. They are not designed to protect our stockholders. Even if a sanction imposed against ZAIS Group, one of ZAIS Group\u2019s subsidiaries or its personnel by a regulator is for a small monetary amount, the adverse publicity related to the sanction could harm ZAIS Group\u2019s reputation, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on ZAIS Group\u2019s businesses in a number of ways, including making it harder for ZAIS Group to obtain investments in the ZAIS Managed Entities and discouraging prospective clients and investors from doing business with ZAIS Group. See \u201c-ZAIS Group is highly dependent on its information and communication systems; systems failures and other operational disruptions, including cyber-attacks, could significantly affect ZAIS Group\u2019s business, which may, in turn, negatively affect ZAIS Group\u2019s operating results.\u201d\nFailure to comply with \u201cpay to play\u201d regulations implemented by the SEC and certain states, and changes to the \u201cpay to play\u201d regulatory regimes, could adversely affect ZAIS Group\u2019s businesses.\nIn recent years, the SEC and several states have initiated investigations alleging that certain private equity firms and asset management firms or agents acting on their behalf have paid money to current or former government officials or their associates in exchange for improperly soliciting contracts with state pension funds. In June 2010, the SEC approved Rule 206(4)-5 under the Advisers Act regarding \u201cpay to play\u201d practices by investment advisers involving campaign contributions and other payments to state or local candidates or government officials (including state or local government officials who run for federal office) able to exert influence on potential government entity clients. Among other restrictions, the rule prohibits investment advisers from providing advisory services for compensation to a government entity for a period of up to two years, subject to very limited exceptions, after the investment adviser, its senior executives or its personnel involved in soliciting investments from government entities make contributions (except in de minimis amounts) to certain elected candidates and officials in a position to influence the hiring of an investment adviser by such government entity. An adviser is required to implement compliance policies designed, among other matters, to track contributions by certain of the adviser\u2019s employees and engagements of third parties that solicit government entities and to keep certain records to enable the SEC to determine compliance with the rule. In addition, there have been similar rules on a state level regarding \u201cpay to play\u201d practices by investment advisers.\nAs public pension plans are investors in some of the ZAIS Managed Entities, these rules could result in significant economic sanctions on ZAIS Group\u2019s businesses if ZAIS Group or any of the other persons covered by the rules make any such contribution or payment, whether or not material or with an intent to secure an investment from a public pension plan, or may, for instance, provide a basis for the redemption of affected public pension fund investors. In addition, investigations relating to the foregoing activities may require the attention of senior management and may result in fines if ZAIS Group is deemed to have violated any regulations, thereby imposing additional expenses on us. Any failure on ZAIS Group\u2019s part to comply with these rules could cause ZAIS Group to lose compensation for its advisory services and/or expose it to significant penalties and reputational damage.\nNew or changed laws or regulations governing ZAIS Group or the ZAIS Managed Entities\u2019 operations and changes in the interpretation thereof could adversely affect ZAIS Group\u2019s business.\nThe laws and regulations governing the operations of the ZAIS Managed Entities, as well as their interpretation, may change from time to time, and new laws and regulations may be enacted. Accordingly, any change in these laws or regulations and changes in their interpretation, or newly enacted laws or regulations and any failure by the ZAIS Managed Entities to comply with these laws or regulations, could require changes to certain of ZAIS Group\u2019s business practices, negatively impact ZAIS Group\u2019s operations, AUM or financial condition, impose additional costs on ZAIS Group or otherwise adversely affect ZAIS Group\u2019s business. The following includes certain significant regulatory risks facing ZAIS Group\u2019s business:\n\u2022 Changes in capital requirements may increase the cost of ZAIS Group\u2019s financing. If regulatory capital requirements - whether under the Dodd-Frank Act, Basel III, or other regulatory action - were to be imposed on the ZAIS Managed Entities, they may be required to limit, or increase the cost of, financing they provide to others. Among other things, this could potentially require the ZAIS Managed Entities to sell assets at an inopportune time or price, which could negatively impact ZAIS Group\u2019s operations, AUM or financial condition.\n\u2022 The imposition of additional legal or regulatory requirements could make compliance more difficult and expensive, affect the manner in which ZAIS Group conducts its businesses and adversely affect ZAIS Group\u2019s profitability. The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, imposes significant new regulations on nearly every aspect of the U.S. financial services industry, including new registration, recordkeeping and reporting requirements on private fund investment advisers. Importantly, while several key aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act have been defined through final rules, their extent and impact are not yet fully known and may not be known for some time. Several aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act remain outstanding and will be implemented by various regulatory bodies over the next several years. The imposition of any additional legal or regulatory requirements could make compliance more difficult and expensive, affect the manner in which ZAIS Group conducts its businesses and adversely affect the performance of the ZAIS Managed Entities or ZAIS Group\u2019s profitability.\n\u2022 The implementation of the \u201cVolcker Rule\u201d could have adverse implications on ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to raise funds from certain entities. In December 2013, the Federal Reserve and other federal regulatory agencies adopted a final rule implementing a section of the Dodd-Frank Act that has become known as the \u201cVolcker Rule.\u201d Subject to certain exceptions for offshore activities by non-U.S. banks and bank holding companies, the Volcker Rule generally prohibits insured banks or thrifts, any bank holding company or savings and loan holding company, any non-U.S. bank with a U.S. branch, agency or commercial lending company and any subsidiaries and affiliates of such entities, regardless of geographic location, from investing in or sponsoring \u201ccovered funds,\u201d which generally include private equity funds or hedge funds and certain other collective investment vehicles and certain other proprietary activities. In addition, the Volcker Rule and its implementing regulations generally prohibit \u201cproprietary trading\u201d in many securities by banking organizations, subject to a market-making and certain other exceptions. Although the Volcker Rule regulations are lengthy and detailed and clarified many issues concerning the Volcker Rule\u2019s scope and related exemptions, the interpretation and implementation of a variety of aspects of those regulations are still uncertain and may not be known for some time. The Volcker Rule clearly and substantially curtails investments by banking organizations in many kinds of private funds, and many commentators have suggested that notwithstanding the Volcker Rule\u2019s market-making exception, an inability by major banking organizations (including major investment banks that are not commercial banks but are subsidiaries of bank holding companies) to engage in proprietary trading will adversely affect the depth and liquidity of the debt security markets. These developments could result in adverse impacts and uncertainties in the financial markets as well as ZAIS Group\u2019s business. Although, in view of the nature of its investors and clients, ZAIS Group does not currently anticipate that the Volcker Rule will adversely affect the ZAIS Managed Entities or ZAIS Group\u2019s fundraising to any significant extent, there could be adverse effects on ZAIS Group\u2019s ability in the future to raise funds from the types of entities mentioned above as a result of this prohibition, and the proprietary trading restrictions may adversely affect trading in markets in which ZAIS Managed Entities invest.\n\u2022 Increased regulation on banks\u2019 leveraged lending activities could negatively affect the terms and availability of credit to the ZAIS Managed Entities. In March 2013, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation published revised guidance regarding expectations for banks\u2019 leveraged lending activities. This guidance, in addition to the final U.S. risk retention rules that took effect in December 2016, could further restrict credit availability, as well as potentially restrict certain of ZAIS Group\u2019s investing activities that rely on banks\u2019 lending activities. This could negatively affect the terms and availability of credit to the ZAIS Managed Entities. See \u201c- ZAIS Group\u2019s use of leverage to finance ZAIS Group\u2019s businesses exposes ZAIS Group to substantial risks, which are exacerbated by the ZAIS Managed Entities\u2019 use of leverage to finance investments\u201d and \u201c- Dependence on leverage by certain of the ZAIS Managed Entities subjects them to potential volatility and contractions in the debt financing markets and could adversely affect ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to achieve attractive rates of return on those investments.\u201d\n\u2022 New restrictions on compensation could limit ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to recruit and retain investment professionals .The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes federal regulatory agencies to review and, in certain cases, prohibit compensation arrangements at financial institutions that give employees incentives to engage in conduct deemed to encourage inappropriate risk-taking by covered financial institutions. Such restrictions could limit ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to recruit and retain investment professionals and senior management executives.\nChanges in partnership tax audit rules effective in 2018 will impose new obligations and potential liabilities on ZGP, ZAIS Group and the ZAIS Managed Entities and may make compliance more difficult and expensive.\nOn November 2, 2015, President Obama signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (the \u201cAct\u201d) into law, instituting for tax years commencing after 2017 significant changes to the rules governing federal tax audits of entities such as ZGP and the ZAIS Managed Entities that are treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The new rules impose an entity-level liability for taxes on partnerships (and concomitantly, in the case of a general or limited partnership (such as certain of the ZAIS Managed Entities), the general partner) in respect of Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) audit adjustments, absent election of an alternative regime described below under which the tax liability is imposed at the partner level. The new rules constitute a significant change from existing law and will require clarification through guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department (the \u201cTreasury\u201d). Certain proposed regulations were issued on January 18, 2017 but subsequently withdrawn in accordance with a White House directive.\nCertain small partnerships are eligible to elect out of the provisions altogether for a given taxable year, with the result that any adjustments to such a partnership\u2019s items can be made only at the partner level. This election may be made only by partnerships with 100 or fewer partners, each of which is an individual, a C corporation, an S corporation or an estate of a deceased partner. Accordingly, for example, any partnership having another partnership as a partner is not eligible to elect out of the new audit regime.\nUnder the new rules, in general, any audit adjustment to items of partnership income, gain, loss, deduction or credit, and any partner\u2019s distributive share thereof, are determined at the partnership level. Subject to election of the alternative regime discussed below, the associated \"imputed underpayment\u201d - the tax deficiency arising from a partnership-level adjustment with respect to a partnership tax year (a \"reviewed year\") - is calculated using the maximum statutory income tax rate and is assessed against and collected from the partnership in the year that such audit or any judicial review is completed (the \"adjustment year\"). In addition, the partnership is directly liable for any related penalties and interest, calculated as if the partnership had been originally liable for the tax in the audited year.\nUnder an alternative regime, if the partnership makes a timely election with respect to an imputed underpayment and furnishes to each partner of the partnership for the reviewed year, and to the Treasury, a statement of the partner\u2019s share of any adjustment to income, gain, loss, deduction or credit, the rules requiring partnership level assessment will not apply with respect to the underpayment and each affected partner will be required to take the adjustment into account on the partner\u2019s individual tax return, and pay an increased tax, for the taxable year in which the partner receives the adjusted information return. Under this alternative, the reviewed year partners (rather than the partnership) are liable for any related penalties and interest, with deficiency interest calculated at an increased rate and running from the reviewed year.\nThe Act also institutes significant changes to procedural aspects of partnership audits. Among other things, the \u201ctax matters partner\u201d role under prior law is replaced with an expanded \u201cpartnership representative\u201d role. The partnership representative, which will not be required to be a partner, will have sole authority to act on behalf of the partnership in an audit proceeding, and will bind both the partnership and the partners by its actions in the audit.\nAs noted, the Act\u2019s new partnership audit regime applies to tax returns filed for partnership taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The delayed effective date affords time to consider the potential effects of the new rules on affected ZAIS entities, their partnership arrangements and operative agreements and to evaluate options for addressing them. While the Act provides that a partnership may elect for the amendments to the partnership audit rules made by the Act to apply to any return of the partnership filed for partnership taxable years beginning after the date of enactment of the Act and before 2018, it is not currently contemplated that any ZAIS entity will make such an election.\nNew rules may make mortgage securitization more difficult to achieve.\nIn September 2014, the SEC adopted rules substantially revising Regulation AB requirements regarding the offering process, disclosure and reporting for publicly-issued asset-backed securities (the \u201cEnhanced Disclosure Rules\u201d). Among other things, publicly-issued asset-backed securities transactions effected after the effective date of the Enhanced Disclosure Rules require enhanced loan-level disclosure containing information that was not previously required, as well as substantial additional loan-level information, and requirements for a review of underlying assets by an independent asset representations reviewer if certain trigger events occur. In addition, the SEC has not yet acted on certain rules initially proposed in April 2010 and re-proposed in July 2011 that would make the Enhanced Disclosure Rules applicable to private offerings issued in reliance on Rule 144A or Rule 506 of Regulation D at the request of the investor. Furthermore, as a matter of market-place practice many Rule 144A offerings routinely comply with the rules applicable to public offerings.\nDue to the expense of complying with Regulation AB, RMBS and CMBS sponsors may be less inclined to issue RMBS and CMBS in the future, thereby reducing investment opportunities for ZAIS Group.\nNew rules proposed by the Basel Committee may decrease market liquidity among banks and increase the volatility of certain securities owned by ZAIS Group and the ZAIS Managed Entities.\nIn May 2012, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the \u201cBasel Committee\u201d) introduced a new capital framework, the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (\u201cFRTB\u201d), which set out a number of specific measures designed to modify trading book capital requirements. The final FRTB standards were adopted by the Basel Committee in January 2016, and regulators in various jurisdictions are expected to adopt modified standards based on the FRTB standards. If such standards are adopted, new rules would likely decrease market liquidity among banks and increase the volatility of certain securities owned by ZAIS Group and the ZAIS Managed Entities.\nRisk retention requirements in Europe and the United States may make securitization of assets less profitable.\nArticles 404-410 (inclusive) of the Capital Requirements Regulation 575/2013 apply to credit institutions established in a member state of the European Economic Area (\"EEA\") and investment firms (such articles, together with any applicable guidance, technical standards or related documents published by the European Banking Authority and any related delegated regulations of the European Commission, the \"CRR Retention Requirements\"). Among other things, the CRR Retention Requirements restrict credit institutions and investment firms from investing in securitizations, including collateralized loan obligation transactions, unless (i) the originator, sponsor or original lender in respect of the relevant securitization has explicitly disclosed that it will retain, on an ongoing basis, a net economic interest of not less than 5% in respect of certain specified credit risk tranches or securitized exposures and (ii) such investor is able to demonstrate that it has undertaken certain due diligence in respect of various matters including but not limited to its investment position, the underlying assets and (in the case of certain types of investors) the relevant sponsor or originator. Similar requirements are or are expected to be imposed on European insurance companies, UCITS funds and investment funds managed by EEA alternative investment fund managers (such requirements, collectively with the CRR Retention Requirements, the \"EU Retention and Due Diligence Requirements\"). Failure to comply with the EU Retention and Due Diligence Requirements may result in various penalties including, in the case of those investors subject to regulatory capital requirements, the imposition of a punitive capital charge on the asset-backed securities acquired by the relevant investor.\nIt is not clear how the foregoing regulations will be implemented in each Member State of the European Union. No assurance can be given that the implementation throughout the European Union of the EU Retention and Due Diligence Requirements and related legislation and regulations will not affect the requirements that will influence relevant investors\u2019 willingness or ability to invest in securitized assets.\nSimilar but not identical requirements to those set out in Articles 404 through 410 of the EU CRR have been finalized for alternative investment fund managers which are required to become authorized under the European Union\u2019s Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (Directive 2011/61/EU) (the \u201cAIFMD\u201d). The AIFMD has been implemented in the Member States of the European Union pursuant to Section 5 of Regulation (EU) No 231/2013 (the \u201cAIFM Regulation\u201d); Articles 50 through 56 of the AIFM Regulation contain the risk retention and diligence requirements applicable to regulated alternative investment fund managers assuming exposure to securitization positions on behalf of one or more alternative investment funds they manage. Similar requirements are expected to be implemented for other types of European Union-regulated investors or investment managers (for example, insurance and reinsurance undertakings) in the future. Compliance with the increased regulatory burden imposed by the AIFMD may increase the operating expenses of ZAIS Group and the ZAIS Managed Entities. In general, ZAIS Managed Entities must comply with legal requirements, including requirements imposed by the AIFMD, securities laws, and company laws in various jurisdictions where ZAIS Managed Entities are domiciled or offered. Should any of these laws change or exemptions under these regulations cease to be available or desirable over the duration of the ZAIS Managed Entities, the legal requirements to which the ZAIS Managed Entities may be subject could differ substantially from current requirements.\nOn October 21 and 22, 2014, six United States federal agencies (including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the SEC, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency) adopted the US Risk Retention Regulations, which became effective in December 2016. Except with respect to asset-backed securities transactions that satisfy certain exemptions, the US Risk Retention Regulations generally require securitizers of asset-backed securities to retain not less than 5% of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing such asset-backed securities. For purposes of these regulations, ZAIS Group will most likely be the \u201csecuritizer\u201d for most CLOs it manages. It is not possible to fully predict the impact of the US Risk Retention Regulations on the structured credit market, but it is possible that these new regulations may lead to reduced liquidity, a smaller market for new issuances and a general decrease in expected revenue and profit for entities (like ZAIS Group) acting as securitizer or investing in RMBS, CMBS, CLOs or other structured credit investments.\nAs a result of the rules discussed above, ZAIS Group is required to retain at least 5% of the credit risk of any securitization transaction that ZAIS Group sponsors in a Member State of the European Union or the United States, as applicable, and, when risk retention is required, will be prohibited for contractual and/or regulatory reasons from disposing of any such \u2018risk retention\u2019 investment for a defined period during the life of the related securitization, even when it has an opportunity to do so.\nA number of ZAIS Managed Entities trade instruments that require ZAIS Group to be registered with the CFTC as a CTA and a CPO.\nCertain ZAIS Managed Entities trade instruments that require ZAIS Group to be registered with the CFTC as a Commodity Trading Adviser (\u201cCTA\u201d) and a Commodity Pool Operator (\u201cCPO\u201d). Registration as a CTA and CPO requires that ZAIS Group comply with a number of complex regulations and conduct ZAIS Group\u2019s business in compliance with certain restrictions placed on the activities of ZAIS Managed Entities. Additionally, as a CTA and CPO, ZAIS Group is subject to examination by the NFA. The compliance infrastructure necessary to conduct ZAIS Group\u2019s business in accordance with these regulations is both costly and time consuming. If the NFA were to find that ZAIS Group is not conducting its business in accordance with these rules and regulations, it may be required to cease certain types of activities on behalf of the ZAIS Managed Entities. ZAIS Group\u2019s inability to conduct certain types of trades could impede the performance of those ZAIS Managed Entities, may result in reputational harm to ZAIS Group and could have an impact on its profitability.\nIn order to trade certain derivatives products, ZAIS Group must maintain its membership on an SEF and be subject to the SEF\u2019s rules and regulations. Failure to maintain such membership, or failure to comply with the SEF\u2019s rules, could adversely impact ZAIS Group\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires that certain types of cleared derivatives trades be executed on a SEF. SEFs are self-regulatory organizations for purposes of the CEA, and SEF members must agree to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEF, including rules regarding trading practices, disclosure obligations, financial reporting requirements and books and records requirements. Each SEF charges transaction fees, and some SEFs require that their members indemnify the SEF against certain losses or costs that may be incurred as a result of the transactions executed on the SEF.\nZAIS Group currently maintains membership on various SEFs and is subject to the rules of each such SEF. Any failure to comply with these rules may subject ZAIS Group to regulatory action, may result in reputational harm and may affect the value of Class A Common Stock. In addition, no assurance can be made that ZAIS Group will be able to maintain its membership on any SEF in the future, which would prevent ZAIS Group from trading those types of swaps that are required by regulation to be executed on a SEF. Any inability of ZAIS Group to participate fully in the derivatives market may result in ZAIS Group being unable to execute on a trading strategy, which could adversely impact its business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to regulatory investigations, which could harm ZAIS Group\u2019s reputation and cause the ZAIS Managed Entities to lose existing investors or accounts or fail to attract new investors or accounts.\nLike most financial services firms, from time to time ZAIS Group is subject to formal regulatory inquiries. ZAIS Group discloses information regarding such inquiries if disclosure is required pursuant to financial reporting or securities disclosure standards.\nThe failure by ZAIS Group to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, suspensions of individual employees or other sanctions. Even if an investigation or proceeding did not result in a fine or sanction or the fine or sanction imposed against ZAIS Group or ZAIS Group\u2019s employees by a regulator were small in monetary amount, adverse publicity relating to an investigation, proceeding or imposition of these fines or sanctions could harm ZAIS Group\u2019s reputation and cause the ZAIS Managed Entities to lose existing investors or accounts or fail to attract new investors or accounts.\nZAIS Group is subject to the U.K. Bribery Act, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws, as well as export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing ZAIS Group\u2019s operations. If it fails to comply with these laws, it could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could adversely affect ZAIS Group\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nZAIS Group\u2019s operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (the \u201cBribery Act\u201d), the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries where ZAIS Group does business. The Bribery Act, FCPA and these other laws generally prohibit ZAIS Group and ZAIS Group\u2019s employees and intermediaries from bribing, being bribed or giving other prohibited payments or items or actions of value to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. ZAIS Group\u2019s commercial partners operate in a number of jurisdictions that may pose a risk of potential Bribery Act or FCPA violations, and ZAIS Group participates in collaborations and relationships with third parties whose actions could potentially subject ZAIS Group to liability under the Bribery Act, FCPA or local anti-corruption laws. In addition, ZAIS Group cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which ZAIS Group\u2019s internal operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nZAIS Group is also subject to other laws and regulations governing its international operations, including regulations administered by the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States, and authorities in the European Union, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions on countries or persons, customs requirements and currency exchange regulations, or \u201cTrade Control Laws.\u201d\nThere is no assurance that ZAIS Group will be completely effective in ensuring its compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the Bribery Act, the FCPA or other legal requirements and Trade Control Laws. If ZAIS Group is not in compliance with the Bribery Act, the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control Laws, it may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on ZAIS Group\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Likewise, any investigation of any potential violations of the Bribery Act, the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control Laws by U.K., U.S. or other authorities could also have an adverse impact on ZAIS Group\u2019s reputation, ZAIS Group\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to the Operation of ZAIS Group\u2019s Business\nZAIS Group is subject to risks in using custodians, counterparties, administrators, prime brokers, clearing and other agents.\nZAIS Group, in its capacity as an investment adviser, and some of the ZAIS Managed Entities depend on the services of custodians, counterparties, administrators, prime brokers and other agents to carry out certain financing, investment and derivatives transactions. The terms of these contracts are often customized and complex. In particular, some of the ZAIS Managed Entities use arrangements with a relatively limited number of counterparties, which has the effect of concentrating the transaction volume (and related counterparty default risk) of such ZAIS Managed Entities with these counterparties.\nThe ZAIS Managed Entities are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these contracts defaults, either voluntarily or involuntarily, on its performance under the contract. Any such default may occur suddenly and without notice to ZAIS Group. Moreover, if a counterparty defaults, ZAIS Group may be unable to take action to cover its exposure, either because it lacks contractual recourse or because market conditions make it difficult to take effective action. This inability could occur in times of market stress, which is when defaults are most likely to occur.\nIn addition, it may not be possible for ZAIS Group to accurately predict the impact of market stress or counterparty financial condition, and as a result, ZAIS Group may not be in a position to take sufficient action to reduce the ZAIS Managed Entities\u2019 risks effectively. Default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect, foresee or evaluate. In addition, concerns about, or a default by, one large participant could lead to significant liquidity problems for other participants, which may in turn expose ZAIS Group to significant losses.\nThe ZAIS Managed Entities often have large positions with a single counterparty. For example, some of the ZAIS Managed Entities have credit lines. If the lender under one or more of those credit lines were to become insolvent, ZAIS Group may have difficulty replacing the credit line and one or more of the ZAIS Managed Entities may face liquidity problems.\nIn the event of a counterparty default, particularly a default by a major financial institution or a default by a counterparty to a significant number of ZAIS Managed Entities\u2019 contracts, one or more of the ZAIS Managed Entities may have outstanding trades that they cannot settle or are delayed in settling. As a result, these ZAIS Managed Entities could incur material losses and the resulting market impact of a major counterparty default could harm ZAIS Group\u2019s businesses, results of operation and financial condition.\nIn the event of the insolvency of a prime broker, custodian, counterparty or any other party that is holding assets of ZAIS or the ZAIS Managed Entities as collateral, ZAIS or the ZAIS Managed Entities might not be able to recover equivalent assets in full as they may rank among the prime broker\u2019s, custodian\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s unsecured creditors in relation to the assets held as collateral. In addition, ZAIS Group has elected not to require swap dealers and major swap participants that are ZAIS Managed Entity counterparties to segregate any initial margin posted by the ZAIS Managed Entities in respect of any uncleared swaps entered into on or after November 3, 2014 in accordance with CFTC Rule 23.701. Because the cash is not segregated from such counterparty\u2019s own cash and may not be segregated from the prime broker\u2019s, custodian\u2019s or other counterparty\u2019s own cash, ZAIS or the ZAIS Managed Entities may therefore rank as unsecured creditors in relation thereto and ZAIS or the ZAIS Managed Entities, as applicable, will bear the risk of such losses. If ZAIS Managed Entities\u2019 derivatives transactions are cleared through a derivatives clearing organization, the CFTC has issued final rules regulating the segregation and protection of collateral posted by customers of cleared swaps.\nZAIS Group is highly dependent on its information and communication systems; systems failures and other operational disruptions, including cyber-attacks, could significantly affect ZAIS Group\u2019s business, which may, in turn, negatively affect ZAIS Group\u2019s operating results.\nZAIS Group\u2019s business is highly dependent on its communications and information systems which may interface with or depend on systems operated by third parties, including market counterparties and other service providers. Any failure or interruption of these systems could cause delays or other problems in ZAIS Group\u2019s activities, which could have a material adverse effect on ZAIS Group\u2019s operating results and negatively affect the value of Class A Common Stock and ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to make distributions to ZGP.\nAdditionally, ZAIS Group relies heavily on financial, accounting and other data processing systems and operational risks arising from mistakes made in the confirmation or settlement of transactions, from transactions not being properly booked, evaluated or accounted for or other similar disruption in ZAIS Group\u2019s operations may cause ZAIS Group to suffer financial loss, the disruption of ZAIS Group\u2019s business, liability to third parties, regulatory intervention or reputational damage.\nZAIS Group also faces various security threats, including cyber security attacks to ZAIS Group\u2019s information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to ZAIS Group\u2019s proprietary information (including information of ZAIS Group\u2019s clients, investors and employees), destroy data or disable, degrade or sabotage ZAIS Group\u2019s systems. These security threats could originate from a wide variety of sources, including unknown third parties. As with all financial institutions, we may be exposed to new and emerging cyber threats against which we are not immediately or adequately protected. ZAIS Group is not aware of any cyber-attacks on its systems which prevented the Company from conducting its day to day operations in the normal course of business. Although ZAIS Group uses various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate these threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls are sufficient to prevent disruptions to ZAIS Group\u2019s systems. If any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled for any reason or if there is any unauthorized disclosure of data, such as personal client, investor, borrower and employee information, whether as a result of tampering, a breach of ZAIS Group\u2019s network security systems, a cyber-incident or attack or otherwise, ZAIS Group could suffer financial loss, a disruption of ZAIS Group\u2019s businesses, liability, regulatory intervention or reputational damage.\nAlthough ZAIS Group has back-up systems and cyber security and consumer protection measures in place, ZAIS Group\u2019s back-up procedures, cyber defenses and capabilities in the event of a failure, interruption, or breach of security may not be adequate. Insurance and other safeguards on which ZAIS Group relies may not be available or may only partially reimburse ZAIS Group for its losses related to operational failures or cyber-attacks. In addition, ZAIS Group may choose to reimburse a client in the event of a trading error or under other circumstances, even if it is not legally required to do so, and any such reimbursements could adversely affect ZAIS Group\u2019s results of operations.\nDeveloping and maintaining ZAIS Group\u2019s operational systems and infrastructure and protecting ZAIS Group\u2019s systems from cyber security attacks and threats may become increasingly challenging and costly, which could constrain ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to expand ZAIS Group\u2019s businesses. Any upgrades or expansions to ZAIS Group\u2019s operations or technology may require significant expenditures and may increase the probability that ZAIS Group will suffer system interruptions and failures. ZAIS Group also depends substantially on its Red Bank office where a majority of ZAIS Group\u2019s employees, administration and technology resources are located, for the continued operation of ZAIS Group\u2019s business. Any significant disruption to that office could have a material adverse effect on ZAIS Group.\nIf ZAIS Group\u2019s risk management systems for ZAIS Group\u2019s asset management business are ineffective, ZAIS Group may be exposed to material unanticipated losses.\nZAIS Group\u2019s risk management techniques and strategies may not fully mitigate the risk exposure of the ZAIS Managed Entities or ZAIS Group\u2019s investments in all economic or market environments, or against all types of risk, including risks that ZAIS Group might fail to identify or anticipate. Some of ZAIS Group\u2019s strategies for managing risk are based upon its use of historical market behavior statistics. ZAIS Group applies statistical and other tools to these observations to measure and analyze the risks to which the ZAIS Managed Entities are exposed. Any failures in ZAIS Group\u2019s risk management techniques and strategies to accurately quantify such risk exposure could limit ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to manage risks in the ZAIS Managed Entities or to seek adequate risk-adjusted returns. In addition, any risk management failures could cause a ZAIS Group\u2019s investments or one of its ZAIS Managed Entity\u2019s losses to be significantly greater than the historical measures predict. Further, modeling does not take all risks into account. ZAIS Group\u2019s approach to managing those risks could prove insufficient, exposing ZAIS Group and the ZAIS Managed Entities to material unanticipated losses.\nThe due diligence process ZAIS Group undertakes in connection with investments may not reveal all facts that may be relevant in connection with an investment.\nBefore making certain investments, ZAIS Group conducts due diligence that it deems reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to those investments. When conducting due diligence, ZAIS Group may be required to evaluate important and complex business, financial, tax, accounting, environmental and legal issues. Outside consultants, legal advisors, service providers, accountants and investment banks may be involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of investment. Nevertheless, when conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding an investment, ZAIS Group relies on the resources available to it, including information provided by the target of the investment and, in some circumstances, third-party investigations. The due diligence investigation that ZAIS Group conducts with respect to any investment opportunity may not reveal or highlight all relevant facts that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating such investment opportunity. Moreover, such an investigation will not necessarily result in the investment being successful.\nZAIS Group uses analytical models and data in connection with the valuation of ZAIS Group\u2019s investments and the investments of the ZAIS Managed Entities, and any incorrect, misleading or incomplete information used in connection therewith would subject ZAIS Group to potential risks.\nGiven the complexity of ZAIS Group\u2019s investment strategies, ZAIS Group relies heavily on analytical models and information supplied by third parties. Models and data are used to value potential target assets and also in connection with hedging ZAIS Group\u2019s positions and those of the ZAIS Managed Entities. In the event models and data prove to be incorrect, misleading or incomplete, any decisions made in reliance thereon could expose ZAIS Group to potential risks. For example, by relying on incorrect models and data, especially valuation models, ZAIS Group may be induced to buy assets at prices that are too high, to sell certain other assets at prices that are too low or to miss favorable opportunities altogether. Similarly, any hedging based on faulty models and data may prove to be unsuccessful and result in additional costs.\nZAIS Group relies on intellectual property to conduct its business and any disruption to this intellectual property could impede ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to carry out its initiatives.\nZAIS Group\u2019s business is dependent on the use of intellectual property, including intellectual property licensed from third parties and certain protected intellectual property that it has developed. Many of ZAIS Group\u2019s investments are based on its analytical models and the systems that generate these models. There are a number of risks associated with ZAIS Group\u2019s intellectual property including the risk that:\n\u2022 the third party licensing certain intellectual property to ZAIS Group is no longer willing to license such intellectual property to ZAIS Group, or is unwilling to license the intellectual property to ZAIS Group at a price that it is willing to pay;\n\u2022 the intellectual property that ZAIS Group has developed is stolen or sabotaged;\n\u2022 the intellectual property that ZAIS Group has developed becomes obsolete and ZAIS Group is unable to develop new intellectual property to replace the outdated systems, models or software; and\n\u2022 ZAIS Group is unable to retain or attract competent employees who are able to maintain and further develop such intellectual property.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Organizational Structure\nMr. Zugel controls a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock in his capacity as sole trustee of a voting trust that holds the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock.\nWe have two classes of common stock: Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. At the closing of the Business Combination 20,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock were transferred to the ZGP Founder Members and immediately deposited into a newly created irrevocable trust (the \u201cZGH Class B Voting Trust\u201d), of which Christian Zugel is the initial sole trustee. Shares of Class B Common Stock are entitled to ten votes per share and vote with the holders of Class A Common Stock, as a single class, on all matters presented to holders of our Common Stock for a vote. The ZGH Class B Voting Trust is entitled to vote the shares of Class B Common Stock in its own discretion and represents approximately 93.5% of the combined voting power of our Common Stock at December 31, 2016. In the future, even if all 180,000,000 authorized shares of Class A Common Stock are issued and outstanding, and assuming the 20,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock remain outstanding, the holders of Class B Common Stock would hold approximately 52.6% of the combined voting power of our Common Stock. The number of shares of Class B Common Stock may be reduced in the future if the ZGP Founder Members\u2019 ownership of our capital stock (which includes securities exercisable for or convertible into our capital stock) under certain circumstances decreases below 20%.\nFor so long as the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock represent at least a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, the holders of Class B Common Stock are able to elect all of the members of our board of directors and thereby control our management and affairs, including determinations with respect to acquisitions, dispositions, borrowings, issuances of securities, and the declaration and payment of dividends. In addition, the holders of Class B Common Stock are generally able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring approval of our stockholders, and are able to cause or prevent a change of control of the Company or a change in the composition of our board of directors, and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of the Company even though it may be in the best interests of the holders of Class A Common Stock. In particular, this concentration of voting power could deprive holders of Class A Common Stock of the opportunity to receive a premium for their shares of Class A Common Stock as part of a sale of the Company, and could ultimately adversely affect the market price of the Class A Common Stock.\nMr. Zugel and the ZGP Founder Members have voting control and other significant influence over us, and their interests may differ from those of our public stockholders.\nAs sole trustee of the ZGH Class B Voting Trust, Mr. Zugel has control over approximately 93.5% of the voting power of the outstanding common stock of the Company, subject to reduction if the ownership by the ZGP Founder Members of the Company and/or ZGP decreases below 20% under certain circumstances. The ZGP Founder Members also have consent rights under the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement, as amended, among us, ZGP and the ZGP Founder Members (the \u201cZGP LLC Agreement\u201d) with respect to certain actions of ZGP.\nMr. Zugel, together with Mr. Zugel\u2019s spouse and family trusts and his former spouse, own approximately 33.5% of the outstanding Class A units of ZGP (\u201cClass A Units\u201d). Because such interests are held directly in ZGP, and not in the Company, Mr. Zugel, as an owner of Class A Units, may have conflicting interests with holders of shares of our Class A Common Stock. For example, if ZGP makes distributions to the Company, the ZGP Founder Members and other members are also entitled to receive such distributions pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership in ZGP and their preferences as to the timing and amount of any such distributions may differ from those of our public stockholders. Mr. Zugel, together with his spouse and family trusts and his former spouse may also have different tax positions from us that could influence Mr. Zugel\u2019s decisions regarding whether and when to dispose of ZGP\u2019s assets, especially in light of the Tax Receivable Agreement that we entered into in connection with the Business Combination, as amended (\u201cTax Receivable Agreement\u201d), whether and when to incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, and whether and when the Company should terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement and accelerate its obligations thereunder. In addition, the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration Mr. Zugel\u2019s and/or Mr Zugel\u2019s family members\u2019 and trusts\u2019 tax or other considerations even where no similar benefit would accrue to us or our shareholders.\nZAIS\u2019s only significant asset is its ownership of approximately 66.5% of ZGP. We have no operations of our own and no independent ability to generate revenue, and may not have sufficient funds to pay taxes, pay interest, pay dividends on the Class A Common Stock, if any, or make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nBecause all of ZAIS\u2019s activity is conducted through its operating subsidiary, ZAIS Group, we have no direct operations and no significant assets other than the ownership of approximately 66.5% of ZGP at December 31, 2016. With no operations of our own and no independent ability to generate revenue, we accordingly are dependent upon distributions from ZGP to pay our taxes, pay interest to creditors, pay dividends to our stockholders and make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. We are required to pay taxes on our allocable share of the taxable income of ZGP without regard to whether ZGP distributes any cash or other property to us. Although the ZGP LLC Agreement requires ZGP to make distributions to the holders of the Class A Units and any vested ZGP Class B Units (the \u201cClass B Units\u201d and together with the Class A Units, the \u201cUnits\u201d) (including us) pro rata equal to the income tax on the cumulative positive taxable income of ZGP as determined based on an assumed tax rate and certain other factors, ZGP must have sufficient available cash in order to make these distributions. Further, although we intend to cause ZGP to make sufficient distributions to allow us to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, pay interest to our creditors and pay dividends, if any, to our stockholders, deterioration in the financial condition, earnings or cash flow of ZGP and ZAIS Group for any reason could limit or impair ZGP\u2019s ability to pay such distributions. Additionally, to the extent that we need funds and ZGP is restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of our financing arrangements, or is otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nPayments of dividends, if any, is at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our business, operating results and financial condition, current and anticipated cash needs (including our obligation to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement), plans for expansion and any legal or contractual limitations on our ability to pay dividends. Any financing arrangement that we enter into in the future may include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to pay dividends. In addition, ZGP is generally prohibited under Delaware law from making a distribution to a member to the extent that, at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, liabilities of ZGP (with certain exceptions) exceed the fair value of its assets. ZAIS Group and its subsidiaries are generally subject to similar legal limitations on their ability to make distributions to unitholders.\nAlthough we may be entitled to tax benefits relating to additional tax depreciation or amortization deductions as a result of a tax basis step-up we receive in connection with exchanges of Units for Class A Common Stock and related transactions, we are required to pay the exchanging members of ZGP 85% of these tax benefits under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nHolders of Units (other than us) may, subject to certain conditions and transfer restrictions, exchange their Units for Class A Common Stock or cash or a combination of stock and cash at the election of ZAIS pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, dated as of March 17, 2015, by and among the Company, ZGP, the Company Unitholders (as defined therein) and Christian M. Zugel, as trustee of the ZGH Class B Voting Trust, as amended on July 21, 2015 (\u201cExchange Agreement\u201d). These exchanges may result in increases in our allocable share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of ZGP. These increases in tax basis may increase (for tax purposes) depreciation and amortization deductions and therefore reduce the amount of income or franchise tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future, although the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) or any applicable foreign, state or local tax authority may challenge all or part of that tax basis increase, and a court could sustain such a challenge.\nIn connection with the Business Combination, ZAIS entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement, which provides for payment by ZAIS to exchanging holders of Units of 85% of income or franchise tax benefits, if any, that ZAIS realizes as a result of these increases in tax basis and of certain other tax benefits related to entering into the Tax Receivable Agreement, including income or franchise tax benefits attributable to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. This payment obligation is an obligation of ZAIS and not of ZGP. While the actual increase in our allocable share of ZGP\u2019s tax basis in its assets, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, varies depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges, the price of shares of Class A Common Stock at the time of the exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable, the amount and timing of our income as a result of the possible size and frequency of the exchanges and the resulting increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of ZGP and ZAIS\u2019s tax position, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement could be substantial in certain circumstances and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. The payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are not conditioned upon continued ownership of us by the holders of Units.\nThe exchanging holders of Units will not be required to reimburse us for any excess payments that may previously have been made under the Tax Receivable Agreement, for example, due to adjustments resulting from examinations by taxing authorities. Rather, excess payments made to such holders will be netted against payments otherwise to be made, if any, after the determination of such excess. As a result, in certain circumstances we could make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement in excess of our actual income or franchise tax savings, which could materially impair our financial condition.\nIn certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated or significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement provides that, in the event that we exercise our right to early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement, or in the event of a change in control of ZAIS, the Tax Receivable Agreement will terminate, and ZAIS will be required to make a lump-sum payment to the ZGP Founder Members and holders of Class B Units (which are parties to the Tax Receivable Agreement and continue to hold Units as of such date) equal to the present value of all forecasted future payments that would have otherwise been made under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which lump-sum payment would be based on certain assumptions, including those relating to our future taxable income and that all holders of Units which are parties to the Exchange Agreement would exchange their Units on the date of the termination. The change of control payment and termination payments to these holders of Units could be substantial and could exceed the actual tax benefits that ZAIS receives as a result of acquiring Units from other owners of ZGP because the amounts of such payments would be calculated assuming that ZAIS would have been able to use the potential tax benefits each year for the remainder of the amortization periods applicable to the basis increases, and that tax rates applicable to us would be the same as they were in the year of the termination.\nDecisions made by Mr. Zugel (whether in his capacity as the trustee of the ZGH Class B Voting Trust or as an officer of the Company) in the course of running our business, such as with respect to mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes in control, may influence the timing and amount of payments that are received by the ZGP Founder Members and the holders of Class B Units under the Tax Receivable Agreement. For example, the earlier disposition of assets following an exchange or acquisition transaction would generally accelerate payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and increase the present value of such payments, and the disposition of assets before an exchange or acquisition transaction would increase an existing owner\u2019s tax liability without giving rise to any rights of the ZGP Founder Members or holders of Class B Units to receive payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nThere may be a material negative effect on our liquidity if the payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement exceed the actual income or franchise tax savings that ZAIS realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement or if distributions to ZAIS by ZGP are not sufficient to permit ZAIS to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement after it has paid taxes and other expenses. Furthermore, our obligations to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement could make us a less attractive target for an acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the tax benefits that are deemed realized under the Tax Receivable Agreement. We may need to incur indebtedness to finance payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement to the extent our cash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nUnder the Tax Receivable Agreement, ZAIS may be required to make additional payments to the ZGP Founder Members under certain circumstances.\nIn the event that the ZGP Founder Members are required to recognize income or gain as a result of the release of up to an additional 2,800,000 Class A Units (the \u201cAdditional Founder Units\u201d), ZAIS is required to make a payment to the ZGP Founder Members under the Tax Receivable Agreement in an amount equal to 100% of any actual tax refunds or reductions in taxes otherwise payable that ZAIS realizes as a result. ZAIS\u2019s obligation to make this additional payment does not terminate as a result of an early termination or change of control under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nWe may not be able to realize all or a portion of the tax benefits that are expected to result from the acquisition of Units from the other ZGP members.\nUnder the Tax Receivable Agreement, we are entitled to retain 15% of the total tax savings we realize as a result of increases in tax basis created by exchanges of Units for Class A Common Stock or cash, and as a result of certain other tax benefits attributable to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Our ability to realize, and benefit from, these tax savings depends on a number of assumptions, including that we earn sufficient taxable income each year during the period over which the deductions arising from any such basis increases and payments are available and that there are no adverse changes in applicable law or regulations. If our actual taxable income were insufficient to fully use such tax benefits, as is the case in our current financial projections, or there were adverse changes in applicable law or regulations, we may be unable to realize all or a portion of these expected benefits and our cash flows and stockholders\u2019 equity could be negatively affected. Refer to the Risk Factor \u201c ZAIS is taxable as a corporation for U.S. tax purposes and a change in projected long-term profitability could materially impact after-tax results of operations. \u201d for additional information on the impact of taxes on ZAIS.\nOur public stockholders may experience dilution as a consequence of, among other transactions, the release of the Additional Founder Units, the issuance of any equity awards to our employees or the issuance of preferred stock.\nThere are 1,600,000 authorized Class B-0 Units issuable to ZAIS Group employees, of which none were outstanding as of December 31, 2016. In addition, if certain conditions are satisfied, ZGP is required to release 2,800,000 Additional Founder Units to the ZGP Founder Members and may issue 5,200,000 additional Class B Units to ZAIS Group employees. The Company may also issue equity awards to ZAIS Group employees under the 2015 Stock Plan. The Company also has the ability to issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock on terms and conditions established by our board of directors, subject only to the number of authorized shares in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Accordingly, current stockholders may experience substantial dilution. Such dilution could, among other things, limit the ability of our current stockholders to participate in the future earnings and growth of the business.\nIn addition, the board of directors is expressly granted authority to issue shares of the Preferred Stock, in one or more series, and to fix for each such series such voting powers, full or limited, and such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and such qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof as shall be stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the board of directors.\nThe Class B Common Stock, the ZGP LLC Agreement and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for the Class A Common Stock and could entrench management.\nThe concentrated voting power of the Class B Common Stock may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. In addition, the ZGH Class B Voting Trust, as the holder of the Class B Common Stock, generally controls the vote on all matters presented to our stockholders for a vote, including the election of directors. Under the ZGP LLC Agreement, so long as the ZGP Founder Members own 10% of us (computed on a basis that excludes certain shares from consideration) with reference to their Class A Units in ZGP on an as-if-exchanged basis, the ZGP Founder Members can veto a sale of the Class A Units that we hold, which would prevent many forms of a sale of the Company.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the merger or acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022 authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of Class A Common Stock;\n\u2022 provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our bylaws and that our stockholders may only amend our bylaws with the approval of a majority or more of the voting power of all of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote; and\n\u2022 establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nFurther, as a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of the Class A Common Stock.\nA change of control could result in termination of ZAIS Group\u2019s investment advisory and sub-investment advisory agreements.\nPursuant to the Advisers Act, none of ZAIS Group\u2019s investment advisory and sub-investment advisory agreements may be \u201cassigned\u201d without the consent of the client. A sale of a controlling block of our voting securities and certain other transactions could be deemed an \u201cassignment\u201d pursuant to the Advisers Act and the 1940 Act. If such a deemed assignment occurs, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain the necessary consents from clients and, unless the necessary approvals and consents are obtained, the deemed assignment could adversely affect ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to continue managing client accounts, resulting in the loss of AUM and a corresponding loss of revenue.\nRisk Factors Relating to us and our Class A Common Stock\nWe incur increased costs and are subject to additional regulations and requirements as a public operating company, which could lower our profits or make it more difficult to run our business.\nAs a public company, ZAIS incurs significant legal, accounting and other expenses that historically were not incurred by ZGP as a closely held business, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We also incur costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules implemented by the SEC and NASDAQ. The expenses incurred by public operating companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as our executive officers. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our Class A Common Stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.\nIf the operating results of ZAIS Group do not improve, the expectations of investors, stockholders or financial analysts may not be met and the market price of our securities may decline further.\nThe price and trading volume of our Class A Common Stock has fluctuated significantly and has been impacted by our financial results, the lack of securities analysts following our stock, the relatively low liquidity of our stock and apparent program driven trading activity. If the financial results of ZAIS Group do not improve, the expectations of investors in ZAIS or securities analysts may not be met and the market price of the Class A Common Stock may further decline. Fluctuations in the price of the Class A Common Stock could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment. The trading price of our Class A Common Stock may continue to be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Factors affecting the trading price of the Class A Common Stock may include:\n\u2022 our ability to identify and successfully negotiate a strategic transaction;\n\u2022 our ability to grow and manage growth profitably which may be affected by, among other things, competition, and the ability of the company, retain its management and key employees;\n\u2022 the outcome of or cost associated with any legal proceedings that may be instituted against us or our affiliates;\n\u2022 the inability to meet NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements;\n\u2022 costs related to operating as a public company;\n\u2022 changes in political, economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment or financial and capital markets, which could result in changes in demand for products or services or in the value of AUM;\n\u2022 the annual or quarterly results of operations or financial condition of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022 the relative and absolute investment performance of advised or sponsored investment products;\n\u2022 the impact of future acquisitions or divestitures;\n\u2022 the unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings;\n\u2022 the extent and timing of any share repurchases (which have not been authorized by the Board at this time);\n\u2022 the impact, extent and timing of technological changes and the adequacy of intellectual property protection;\n\u2022 the impact of legislative and regulatory actions and reforms and regulatory, supervisory or enforcement actions of government agencies relating to us or ZGP or its subsidiaries;\n\u2022 terrorist activities and international hostilities, which may adversely affect the general economy, financial and capital markets, specific industries, and us or ZGP and its subsidiaries;\n\u2022 the ability to attract and retain highly talented professionals; and\n\u2022 the impact of changes to tax legislation and, generally, our tax position.\nBroad market and industry factors and general economic conditions may also materially harm the market price of the Class A Common Stock irrespective of our operating performance. The stock markets, in general, and NASDAQ, in particular, have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. A loss of investor confidence in the market for investment management companies, or the stocks of other financial services companies which investors perceive to be similar to us could depress the price of the Class A Common Stock regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations.\nAny of the above described factors or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on your investment in the Class A Common Stock. In such circumstances, the trading price of the Class A Common Stock may not recover and may experience a further decline. A decline in the market price of the Class A Common Stock also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future. The decline of our Class A Common Stock may also cause reputational harm to ZAIS which may impact our ability to attract additional commitments to the ZAIS Managed Entities. Failure to raise additional AUM for the ZAIS Managed Entities would have a negative impact on our results of operations. If securities or industry analysts commence publishing research or reports about us, and such reports, or reports on our industry and sector, are negative or unfavorable, the price and trading volume of the Class A Common Stock could decline.\nIf any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause the price or trading volume of the Class A Common Stock to decline.\nNASDAQ may delist our shares which could limit investors\u2019 ability to trade our shares and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nThere can be no assurance we will be able to maintain our listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market. If NASDAQ delists our shares of Class A Common Stock, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022 a limited availability of market quotations for our shares;\n\u2022 reduced price and liquidity with respect to our shares which may materially limit your ability to sell shares of Class A Common Stock;\n\u2022 a determination that the Class A Common Stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which would require brokers trading in our shares to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares;\n\u2022 a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and\n\u2022 a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe market price of the Class A Common Stock may decline due to the large number of shares of Class A Common Stock eligible for exchange and future sale.\nThe market price of shares of the Class A Common Stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of Class A Common Stock in the market or the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell shares of Class A Common Stock in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nPursuant to the registration rights agreement that we entered into in connection with the Business Combination, holders of Units can demand that we register the resale of shares of Class A Common Stock issued upon the exchange of Class A Units and vested Class B Units of ZGP. Although there are timing and other limitations on these exchanges as set forth in the Exchange Agreement, the possibility that these exchanges may occur may adversely impact the trading price of the Class A Common Stock.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies make our shares of Class A Common Stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \u201cJOBS ACT\u201d), enacted in April 2012. For as long as we continue to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d We are currently, and in the future anticipate, taking advantage of these exemptions that do not require us to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, provide the full disclosure regarding executive compensation that would otherwise be needed in our periodic reports and proxy statements, hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation or shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until December 31, 2018, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of the Class A Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any January 31 before the end of that five-year period, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three-year period.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of this provision, and, as a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. Various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies are not applicable to \u201csmaller reporting companies\u201d or are modified and generally less stringent. We are currently, and in the future anticipate, taking advantage of the \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d reporting requirements, including rules that do not require us to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, provide the full disclosure regarding executive compensation, provide selected and supplemental financial information, market risk analysis and other information that would otherwise be needed in our periodic reports and proxy statements.\nWe cannot predict whether investors will find the Class A Common Stock less attractive because we have chosen to rely on these exemptions and modified reporting requirements. If some investors find the Class A Common Stock less attractive as a result of any decisions to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for the Class A Common Stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of NASDAQ\u2019s rules and, as a result, qualify for, and may choose to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. In such a circumstance, you would not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nThe ZGH Class B Voting Trust holds approximately 93.5% of the combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. As a result, we qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of NASDAQ. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power in the election of directors is held by an individual, group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements. For example, controlled companies:\n\u2022 are not required to have a board that is composed of a majority of \u201cindependent directors,\u201d as defined under the rules of such exchange;\n\u2022 are not required to have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors; and\n\u2022 are not required to have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors.\nAlthough we do not currently intend to use this exemption, we may choose to do so in the future. In such an event, a majority of the directors on our board would not be required to be independent. Accordingly, you would not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of NASDAQ. Being a controlled company may also adversely impact the trading price of the Class A Common Stock.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted.\nIn general (and as applicable to us), a company is an \u201cinvestment company,\u201d as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d), if either (1) it is \u201cprimarily\u201d in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities (Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act) or (2) the value of any \u201cinvestment securities\u201d it holds constitute more than 40% of the value of the entity\u2019s total assets, computed on an unconsolidated basis, excluding cash items and U.S. government securities (Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act). The term \u201cinvestment securities\u201d for purposes of Section 3(a)(1)(C) is a broad term, but it excludes investments in majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies or exempted from investment company status merely by one of the \u201cprivate investment company\u201d exemptions under the Investment Company Act.\nWe believe we are not an investment company because we are not primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities and because less than 40% of our assets (excluding cash items and government securities) are investment securities. For all practical purposes, our only asset (other than cash items and government securities) consists of our interest in ZAIS Group, our majority-owned subsidiary. In turn, less than 40% of the value of ZAIS Group\u2019s assets (excluding cash items and government securities) consists of investment securities. We note that most of ZAIS Group\u2019s assets (other than cash items and government securities) consist of investment management contracts and the right to receive incentive compensation, neither of which we believe are investment securities. Accordingly, we believe that neither we nor ZAIS Group is an investment company.\nZAIS Group currently holds a portion of the proceeds of the Business Combination in U.S. treasury securities and money market funds, which, as described above, are excluded from the calculation of the 40% Test. If, however, ZAIS Group deployed those proceeds as investments in registered investment companies (such as mutual funds) or private investment companies, including as investments to allow ZAIS Group to satisfy risk retention requirements, the assets in question would constitute investment securities for purposes of Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act. In addition, if ZAIS Group deployed those proceeds to satisfy risk retention requirements as investments in securitization vehicles that are not investment companies (because they qualify for exemptions from investment company status other than the private investment company exemptions) and those securitization vehicles were not majority owned subsidiaries of ZAIS Group, those interests would also constitute investment securities. As a result of investments of that kind, we could fail to satisfy the 40% Test, and, if there were no other exclusions or exemptions available, we would be considered an investment company and required to register as such.\nA determination that we were an investment company would have a significantly adverse effect upon us, for at least the following reasons: (1) in the absence of receiving an exemptive order from the SEC, under Section 12(d)(3) of the Investment Company Act we might not be permitted to control an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act; (2) our current governance structure would not comply with the requirements of the Investment Company Act; (3) we would be subject to significant restrictions on transactions with affiliates unless those transactions were approved by the SEC; (4) in the absence of receiving an exemptive order from the SEC, we could be subject to restrictions on the kind of incentive compensation that could be offered to employees; and (5) we would be subject to numerous other rules, both substantive and procedural, that apply to investment companies, compliance with which would be difficult and expensive. If ZAIS Group were subject to these additional burdensome and potentially costly requirements, ZAIS Group may not be able to deploy its assets and an inability to do so could also have a significant adverse effect upon ZAIS Group\u2019s business and upon us.\nA portion of ZAIS Group\u2019s revenue and cash flow is variable, which may impact ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to achieve steady earnings growth on a periodic basis and may cause volatility of our Class A Common Stock.\nAlthough ZAIS Group believes that a portion of its revenue is consistent and recurring due to its investment strategy and the nature of its fees, a portion of ZAIS Group\u2019s revenue and cash flow is variable, primarily due to the fact that the incentive income from the ZAIS Managed Entities can vary from year to year. For the year ended December 31, 2016, incentive income was 29.5% of ZAIS Group\u2019s total revenues, representing a 31.1% increase over the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, ZAIS Group also received a non-recurring termination payment of $8.0 million from ZFC REIT during the year ended December 31, 2016. ZAIS Group may also experience fluctuations in its results from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a number of other factors, including changes in the values of the ZAIS Managed Entities\u2019 investments, changes in ZAIS Group\u2019s operating expenses, the degree to which it encounters competition and general economic and market conditions. Such variability may lead to volatility in the trading price of Class A Common Stock. Moreover, ZAIS Group\u2019s results for a particular period are not indicative of ZAIS Group\u2019s performance in a future period.\nPotential conflicts of interest may arise between holders of Class A Common Stock and the ZAIS Managed Entities\u2019 investors.\nAs an investment adviser, ZAIS Group has certain fiduciary duties and contractual obligations to the ZAIS Managed Entities. As a result, it expects to regularly take actions with respect to the purchase or sale of investments by the ZAIS Managed Entities, the structuring of investment transactions for the ZAIS Managed Entities or otherwise in a manner consistent with such duties and obligations but that might at the same time adversely affect ZAIS Group\u2019s near-term results of operations or cash flows. This may in turn have an adverse effect on the price of Class A Common Stock or on the interests of holders of Class A Common Stock. Additionally, to the extent ZAIS Group fails to appropriately deal with any such conflicts of interest, it could negatively impact ZAIS Group\u2019s reputation and ability to raise additional assets in the ZAIS Managed Entities.\nZAIS Group\u2019s use of leverage to finance its business exposes ZAIS Group to substantial risks, which are exacerbated by the ZAIS Managed Entities' use of leverage to finance investments.\nZAIS Group may eventually use a significant amount of borrowings to finance ZAIS Group\u2019s business operations and the use of leverage is required to effectuate certain of ZAIS Group\u2019s initiatives. That would expose ZAIS Group to the typical risks associated with the use of substantial leverage, including those discussed above under \u201c- Dependence on leverage by certain of the ZAIS Managed Entities subjects them to potential volatility and contractions in the debt financing markets and could adversely affect ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to achieve attractive rates of return on those investments.\u201d These risks are exacerbated by the ZAIS Managed Entities' use of leverage to finance investments.\nOur current results of operations may adversely affect ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to retain and motivate its senior management team, senior investment professionals and other key personnel and to recruit, retain and motivate new senior professionals and other key personnel, both of which could adversely affect ZAIS Group\u2019s business, results and financial condition.\nZAIS Group\u2019s future success and potential for growth depend to a substantial degree on its ability to retain and motivate its senior management team, senior investment professionals and other professionals and to strategically recruit, retain and motivate new talented personnel, including new senior professionals. Replacing key individuals would involve significant time and expense and may cause significant disruption to ZAIS Group\u2019s business, including certain of its initiatives. Members of ZAIS Group\u2019s senior management team and investment professionals have received a portion of their compensation in the form of unvested Class B-0 Units which were cancelled on December 30, 2016 in consideration of the receipt, in substitution therefor, of restricted stock units of the Company or cash, both subject to vesting requirements. The restricted stock units vested on March 17, 2017 and, in the case of holders of Class B-0 Units who elected cash and remained employed by ZAIS Group or its subsidiaries through March 17, 2017, cash was paid on March 22, 2017. The indicative value of restricted stock unit awards has declined since the award date of the original issuance of the Class B Units based upon our stock price performance.\nIn order to recruit and retain existing and future senior professionals, ZAIS Group may need to increase the level of compensation that it pays to them. Accordingly, as ZAIS Group promotes or hires new senior professionals over time, it may increase the level of compensation it pays to them, which would cause ZAIS Group\u2019s total employee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of ZAIS Group\u2019s total revenue to increase and adversely affect ZAIS Group\u2019s profitability. In addition, issuance of equity interests in ZAIS Group\u2019s business to future senior professionals would dilute public stockholders.\nZAIS Group believes that it has a workplace culture of collaboration, motivation and alignment of interests with investors. If ZAIS Group does not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage its changing enterprise and maintain this culture, ZAIS Group\u2019s ability to compete successfully and achieve its business objectives could be impaired, which could negatively impact its business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 13827, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "ZAIS"}
