{"cik": "1616817", "company": "Metaldyne Performance Group Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-06", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nProvided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the Company, although they are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we do not currently deem material may also impact our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, including its financial performance, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be adversely affected. Discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nRisks Relating to the AAM Merger\nThe proposed AAM Merger may not be consummated or may not be consummated in the timeframe or manner currently anticipated, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or our stock price.\nThe proposed AAM Merger remains subject to various closing conditions, including adoption of the Merger Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, approval of the AAM Share Issuance by the stockholders of AAM and the receipt of Mexican antitrust approval, among other customary closing conditions. It is possible that the stockholders of either the Company or AAM do not approve the relevant proposals at their respective stockholder meetings, or that a government entity may prohibit, delay or refuse to grant approval for the consummation of the AAM Merger. If any condition to the closing of the AAM Merger is not satisfied or, if permissible, waived, the AAM Merger will not be completed. In addition, satisfying the conditions to the closing of the AAM Merger may take longer than we expect. There can be no assurance that any of the remaining conditions to closing will be satisfied or, if permissible, waived or that other events will not intervene to delay or result in the failure to consummate the AAM Merger.\nAny delay in completing the AAM Merger or the failure to complete the AAM Merger may adversely affect our business or results of operations, may adversely affect the benefits the Company\u2019s stockholders expect to receive from the AAM Merger, or may negatively affect the price of our common stock or the price of the AAM common stock our stockholders may receive in the AAM Merger. Investor confidence could also decline.\nFurther, any delay in closing or a failure to close the AAM Merger could exacerbate any negative impact on our business and our relationships with our customers, suppliers, joint venture partners, other parties with which we maintain business relationships, or employees as described in the risk factors below, as well as negatively impact our ability to implement alternative business plans or pursue other strategic alternatives.\nThe occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement could have a material adverse effect on us and our stock price.\nAs described in the above risk factor, we could experience certain adverse consequences related to the termination of the Merger Agreement and failure to consummate the AAM Merger. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, a termination fee of approximately $50.9 million will be payable by us to AAM. We may also be required to reimburse AAM for certain fees and expenses relating to the proposed AAM Merger up to $15.0 million under certain circumstances. If triggered, payment of the termination fee and reimbursement of expenses may negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and such impact will be in addition to the potential risks and consequences described above related to the failure to consummate the AAM Merger.\nA lawsuit has been filed against MPG and members of the MPG board of directors challenging the disclosures concerning the AAM Merger, and additional lawsuits may be filed; an adverse ruling in any of such lawsuits may prevent the AAM Merger from becoming effective within the expected timeframe.\nMPG and members of the MPG board of directors are named as defendants in a purported class action lawsuit brought by and on behalf of MPG stockholders challenging the disclosures concerning the AAM Merger, seeking, among other things, to enjoin the stockholder vote on the AAM Merger at the special meeting of our stockholders to be held to, among other things, consider and vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the transactions contemplated thereby. If the plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction, then such injunction may prevent the AAM Merger from becoming effective within the expected timeframe. If the completion of the AAM Merger is delayed, it could result in substantial costs to AAM and MPG. In addition, AAM and MPG could incur significant costs in connection with the lawsuit, including costs associated with the indemnification of MPG\u2019s directors and officers. MPG and the members of the MPG board of directors believe that the claims asserted in this lawsuit are without merit.\nDisruption of management\u2019s attention from our ongoing business operations due to the proposed AAM Merger may adversely affect business and results of operations.\nWe have expended, and continue to expend, significant management resources in an effort to complete the AAM Merger. Management\u2019s attention may be diverted away from the day-to-day operations of our business and execution of our existing business plan in our efforts to complete the AAM Merger. This diversion of management resources could disrupt operations and have an adverse effect on our operating results and business.\nWhile the AAM Merger is pending, we will be subject to business uncertainties that could adversely affect our operating results and business generally.\nWhether or not the AAM Merger is ultimately consummated, our business may be adversely affected as a result of the announcement of the AAM Merger and uncertainty relating to the proposed transaction, including the following:\n\u2022\nOur employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles, which might adversely affect our ability to retain, hire and motivate key personnel and other employees; and\n\u2022\nCustomers, suppliers, joint venture partners and other parties with which we maintain business relationships may experience uncertainty about our future and seek alternative relationships with third parties, seek to alter their business relationships with us or fail to extend an existing relationship with us.\nIn addition, we may incur significant additional costs in order to maintain employee morale, retain key employees or continue business relationships. If, despite our efforts, key employees depart because of uncertainty or our business partners adversely alter their relationships with us, our business could be seriously harmed. Any delay in completing the AAM Merger may further increase such uncertainties and the adverse effects related thereto.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs, fees and expenses in connection with the AAM Merger.\nWe have expended and will continue to expend significant costs, fees and expenses for professional services as well as transaction and integration costs in connection with the proposed AAM Merger. These costs will impact our results of operations regardless of whether or not the AAM Merger is consummated.\nThe Merger Agreement restricts our conduct of business prior to completion of the AAM Merger and limits our ability to pursue alternative strategic options.\nThe Merger Agreement restricts us from taking certain actions without AAM\u2019s consent while the AAM Merger is pending. These restrictions may, among other matters, prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities or exercising our business strategy, making certain investments or acquisitions, selling assets, engaging in capital expenditures in excess of certain agreed limits, incurring certain indebtedness or making certain other changes to our business pending the closing of the AAM Merger. These restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, subject to certain exceptions, the Merger Agreement prohibits us from soliciting or engaging in discussions with respect to certain alternative business combination transactions and, in certain circumstances, we will be required to pay a termination fee of approximately $50.9 million to AAM and to reimburse AAM\u2019s transaction-related expenses in order to terminate the Merger Agreement and pursue such an alternative transaction. These provisions may discourage third parties from pursuing business opportunities with us and limit our ability to pursue opportunities that could result in greater value to our stockholders.\nBecause the exchange ratio in the AAM Merger is fixed and the market value of shares of AAM common stock may fluctuate, there can be no guarantee of the market value of the stock consideration the Company\u2019s stockholders will receive in the AAM Merger.\nThe per share portion of Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fixed and will not be adjusted for changes in our business, assets, liabilities, prospects, outlook, financial condition or results of operations, changes in the business, assets, liabilities, prospects, outlook, financial condition or results of operations of AAM or any change in the market price of, analyst estimates of, or projections relating to, our common stock or AAM common stock. The market value of our common stock may vary significantly from the value of the per share portion of the Merger Consideration on the date the Merger Agreement was executed or at other later dates. In addition, because the exchange ratio will not be adjusted, the market value of the shares of AAM common stock issued to the Company\u2019s stockholders in the AAM Merger may be higher or lower than the values of those shares on the date of the Merger Agreement or at other later dates.\nNeither the Company nor AAM is permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement solely because of changes in the market price of either party\u2019s respective common stock.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry and Our Business\nVolatility in the global economy has, and may continue to have, a severe and negative impact on the demand for new vehicles and, in turn, our products.\nThe demand for and pricing of our products are subject to economic conditions and other factors present in the geographic markets where our products are sold that are beyond our control, such as a worsening of global economic and political conditions as a result of rising interest rates or inflation, high unemployment, increased energy and fuel prices, increased volatility in global capital markets, terrorism and international conflicts, climate change, severe weather, regulatory changes, and many other factors. Demand for our products correlates to consumer demand for new vehicles containing our products. Adverse changes in global economic and political conditions, or sluggish or uneven recovery in specific countries or regions, may result in lower consumer confidence, which has a significant impact on consumer demand for vehicles. An economic downturn or other adverse industry conditions that result in even a relatively modest decline in vehicle production levels could reduce our sales and thereby adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA decline in vehicle production levels, particularly with respect to Platforms for which we are a significant supplier, or the financial distress of any of our major customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDemand for our products is directly related to the vehicle production levels of our OEM end-customers. New vehicle sales and production can be affected by general economic or industry conditions, the level of consumer demand, recalls and other safety issues, labor relations issues, fuel prices, fuel efficiency, and vehicle safety regulations and other regulatory requirements, government initiatives, trade agreements, the availability and cost of credit, the availability to our customers and suppliers of critical components needed to complete the production of vehicles, restructuring actions of OEMs, our customers or suppliers, and many other factors. Financial difficulties experienced by any major customer could have a material adverse effect on us if such customer were unable to pay for the products we provide or we experienced a loss of, or material reduction in, business from that customer.\nCyclicality and seasonality in the light, industrial, and commercial vehicle markets could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe light, industrial, and commercial vehicle markets in which we operate are cyclical and seasonal. Some of our largest OEM customers typically shut down vehicle production during certain months or weeks of the year. For example, our OEM customers in North America and Europe typically shut down operations during portions of July and August and one week in December. During these manufacturing shutdown periods, our customers will generally reduce the number of production days because of lower demands and to reduce excess vehicle inventory. In addition, the sale of light, industrial, and commercial vehicles are cyclical and depend on general economic conditions and credit availability. Such cyclicality and seasonality could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe face significant competition.\nThe automotive supply industry is highly competitive. We compete worldwide with other automotive suppliers on the basis of price, technological innovation, quality, delivery, Program launch support, and overall customer service, among other factors. Our ability to compete successfully depends, in large part, on our success in continuing to innovate and manufacture products utilized in Programs or Platforms that have commercial success with consumers, differentiate our products from those of our competitors, continue to deliver quality products in the time frames required by our customers, and maintain low-cost production. We continue to invest in technology and innovation which we believe will be critical to our long-term growth. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products and/or manufacturing processes on a timely basis will be a significant factor in our ability to remain competitive. If we are unsuccessful or are less successful than our competitors in consistently developing innovative products, processes, and/or use of materials, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage. The inability to compete successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on large-volume customers for current and future sales. The loss of any of these customers or a reduction in sales to these customers could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe depend on major vehicle OEMs for our sales. Our financial results are closely correlated to production by Ford, GM, FCA, Daimler, Toyota, and Honda, given our higher sales to these customers. For the year ended December 31, 2016, end-customer sales attributed to these OEMs accounted for approximately 69% of our net sales. We may make fewer sales to these customers for a variety of reasons. The loss of any one of these customers or a significant decrease in business from one or more of these customers could harm our business, reduce our revenues and cash flows, and limit our ability to spread fixed costs over a larger sales base, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA reduction in outsourcing by our customers, or the loss of a material number of Programs, combined with a failure to secure sufficient alternative Programs, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend on the outsourcing of components, modules, and assemblies by vehicle OEMs. The extent of vehicle manufacturer outsourcing is influenced by a number of factors, including: relative cost, quality and timeliness of production by suppliers as compared to vehicle manufacturers, capacity utilization, vehicle manufacturers\u2019 perceptions regarding the strategic importance of certain components/modules to them, labor relations among vehicle manufacturers, their employees and unions, and other considerations. A number of our major OEM customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly compete with our products. These OEMs could elect to manufacture such products for their own uses in place of the products we currently supply. A reduction in outsourcing by vehicle manufacturers, or the loss of a material number of Programs combined with the failure to secure alternative Programs with sufficient volumes and margins, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are under continuing pressure from our customers to reduce our prices.\nAs is common practice in the automotive industry, the majority of our products are sold under long-term contracts with prices scheduled at the time the contracts are established, many of which require price reductions in subsequent years. The inability to offset the impact of such price reductions through continued technology improvements, cost reductions, or other productivity initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may not realize all of the sales expected from awarded business, and we may not fully recover pre-production costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe sales to be generated from awarded business are inherently subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the number of vehicles produced, the timing of vehicle production, and the mix of options our customers, and the ultimate consumers may choose. Anticipated product sales could differ significantly from actual firm orders or firm commitments, and awards of business do not represent guarantees of production volumes or revenues. While we typically enter into long-term agreements for the customers\u2019 purchasing requirements, ranging from one to six years with automatic renewal provisions that generally result in our contracts running for the life of the Program, many customer purchase orders contain provisions that purport to permit our customers to unilaterally cancel our contracts with limited or no notice. Our ability to obtain compensation from our customers for such cancellation, if the cancellation is through no fault of our own, is generally limited to the direct costs we have incurred for raw materials and work-in-process and, in certain instances, unamortized investment costs. If we do not realize all of the sales expected from awarded business, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTypically, it takes two to three years from the time an OEM or Tier I supplier awards us a Program until it is launched and we begin production. In many cases, we must commit substantial resources in preparation for production under awarded Programs well in advance of the customer\u2019s production start date. We may not realize substantially all of the revenue from our incremental business backlog. If we are unable to recover pre-production costs, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur failure to increase production capacity, or overexpansion of production, could harm our business and damage our customer relationships.\nWe may be unable to expand our business, satisfy customer requirements, maintain our competitive position, or improve profitability if we are unable to increase production capacity at our facilities to meet any increased demand for our products. Moreover, we may experience delays in receiving necessary equipment and be unable to meet any increases in customer demand. Failure to satisfy customer demand may result in a loss of market share to competitors and may damage our relationships with key customers.\nDue to the lead time required to produce the equipment used in our manufacturing processes, it can take months and even years to obtain new machines after they are ordered. Accordingly, we are required to order production equipment well in advance of supplying components. In addition, the equipment used in our manufacturing process requires large capital investments. If our manufacturing facilities are not expanded or completed on a timely basis or if anticipated customer orders do not materialize, we may not be able to generate sufficient sales to offset the costs of new production equipment. Furthermore, we rely on longer-term forecasts from our customers to plan our capital expenditures. If these forecasts prove to be inaccurate, either we may have spent too much on capacity growth, which could require us to consolidate facilities, or we may have spent too little on capital expenditures, in which case we may be unable to satisfy customer demand, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, our ability to establish and operate new manufacturing facilities and expand production capacity is subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\nlimitations in the agreements governing our indebtedness that restrict the amount of capital that can be spent on manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022\ninability to raise additional funds or generate sufficient cash flow from operations to purchase raw material inventory and equipment or to build additional manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022\ndelays and cost overruns as a result of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as increases in raw material prices and long lead times or delays with equipment vendors;\n\u2022\ndelays or denials of required approvals by relevant government authorities;\n\u2022\ndiversion of significant management attention and other resources;\n\u2022\ninability to hire qualified personnel; and\n\u2022\nfailure to execute our expansion plan effectively.\nIf we are unable to establish or successfully increase production capacity as a result of the risks described above or otherwise, we may not be able to expand our business to meet any increased demand for our products. Alternatively, if we increase production capacity at our existing facilities, we may not be able to generate sufficient customer demand for our products to support the increased production levels, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely on key machinery and tooling to manufacture components for Powertrain and Safety-Critical systems that cannot be easily replicated.\nWe currently depend on key machinery and tooling used to manufacture components for Powertrain and Safety-Critical systems. Our machinery and tooling are complex, cannot be easily replicated, and have a long lead-time to manufacture. If there is a breakdown in such machinery and tooling that we or our service providers are unable to repair in a timely fashion, or equipment manufacturers fail to timely deliver new equipment, obtaining replacement machinery or rebuilding tooling could involve significant delays and costs, and may not be available to us on reasonable terms. If we or our service providers are unable to repair our equipment or tooling, in some cases, it could take several months, or longer, for a supplier to begin providing machinery and tooling to specification. Any disruption of machinery and tooling supplies could result in lost or deferred sales and customer charges which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we experience Program launch difficulties, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe launch of a new Program is complex, and its success depends on a wide range of factors, including the production readiness of our and our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities and processes, tooling, equipment, employees, initial product quality, and other factors. Our failure to successfully launch new business or to contain launch costs could result in a loss of business or the incurrence of substantial unexpected costs, such as increased scrap or premium freight charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA disruption in our supply or delivery chain could cause one or more of our customers to halt production.\nIn certain instances, we ship our products to customer vehicle assembly plants on a \u201cjust-in-time\u201d basis in order for our customers to maintain low inventory levels. Our suppliers use a similar method in providing raw materials to us. However, the \u201cjust-in-time\u201d method makes the logistics supply chain in our industry very vulnerable to disruptions. These disruptions may result for many reasons, including closures of supplier plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes, mechanical breakdowns, electrical outages, fire, explosions, as well as logistical complications resulting from labor disruptions, weather or other natural disasters, mechanical failures, and delayed customs processing. In addition, we may need to rely on suppliers in local markets that have not yet proven their ability to meet our requirements. The lack of even a small single subcomponent necessary to manufacture one of our products, for whatever reason, could force us to cease production, possibly for a prolonged period. Similarly, a potential quality issue could force us to halt deliveries while we contain nonconforming products or validate our process. Even where products are ready to be shipped, or have been shipped, delays may arise before they reach our customer. If we fail to timely deliver, we may have to absorb our own costs for identifying the cause and solving the problem, as well as expeditiously producing and shipping replacement products. Additionally, if we are unable to deliver our products to our customers in a timely manner, our customers may be forced to cease production and may seek to recover losses from us, which could be significant. Thus, any supply chain disruption could cause the complete shutdown of an assembly line of one of our customers, which could expose us to material claims for compensation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur relationships with key third-party suppliers could be damaged or terminated.\nWe obtain raw materials and components from third-party suppliers. We typically source raw materials or components from single suppliers. Although we are generally able to substitute suppliers for raw materials and components without material short-term costs, in some cases it could be difficult and expensive for us to change suppliers. Various factors could result in the termination of our relationship with any supplier or the inability of suppliers to continue to meet our requirements on favorable terms. For example, volatility in the political or financial markets and uncertainty in the automotive sector could negatively impact the financial viability of certain key third-party suppliers. Severe financial difficulties at any of our suppliers could result in us being unable to obtain, on a timely basis and on similar economic terms, the quantity and quality of components and raw materials we require for the production of our products. In response to financial pressures, suppliers may also exit certain business lines or change the terms on which they are willing to provide raw materials and components to us. The loss of or damage to our relationships with these suppliers or any delay in receiving raw materials and components could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers, and accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWork stoppages or production limitations at one or more of our customers\u2019 facilities could disrupt our production volumes.\nA work stoppage or other limitation on production could occur at customer facilities for any number of reasons, including as a result of disputes under existing collective bargaining agreements with labor unions, or in connection with negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements, or as a result of supplier financial distress or other production constraints or difficulties, or due to disruptions in shipping, or for other factors. A disruption in production at the facilities of our large-volume customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA catastrophic loss of one of our key manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWhile we manufacture our products in several facilities and maintain insurance covering our facilities, including business interruption insurance, a catastrophic loss of the use of all or a portion of one of our manufacturing facilities due to accident, labor issues, weather conditions, acts of war, political unrest, terrorist activity, natural disaster or otherwise, whether short- or long-term, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position and protecting our rights or defending against third-party allegations of infringement may be costly.\nProtection of proprietary processes, know-how, trade secrets, documentation, and other technology is critical to our business. Failure to protect, monitor, and control the use of our existing know-how, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights could cause us to lose our competitive advantage and incur significant expenses. We rely on trademarks, copyrights, patents, and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property rights, but these measures may be insufficient. While we enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and agreements for assignment of invention with our employees and third parties to protect our know-how, trade secrets, and intellectual property rights, such agreements and assignments could be breached and may not provide meaningful protection. Also, others may independently develop technologies or products that are similar to ours. In such case, our know-how and trade secrets would not prevent third parties from competing with us. Third parties may seek to oppose, cancel, or invalidate our intellectual property rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our patents expire on various dates through 2031.\nThe costs associated with the protection of our know-how, trade secrets, intellectual property, and our proprietary rights and technology are ongoing. Third parties or employees may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property rights. Policing unauthorized use of intellectual property rights can be difficult and expensive, and adequate remedies may not be available. Failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position, and protecting our rights or defending against third-party allegations of infringement may be costly, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAny acquisitions or joint ventures we make could disrupt and materially harm our business.\nWe may grow through acquisitions of complementary businesses, products or technologies, or by entering into joint ventures. Acquisitions or strategic alliances involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the integration of the acquired businesses or incorporating joint ventures;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of our management team\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nuncertainties in assessing the value, strengths, and potential profitability of, and identifying the extent of all weaknesses of, acquisition candidates;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of unknown liabilities, including environmental, tax, pension, and litigation liabilities, and undisclosed risks impacting the target;\n\u2022\nadverse effects on existing customer and supplier relationships;\n\u2022\nincurrence of substantial indebtedness;\n\u2022\npotentially dilutive issuances of equity securities;\n\u2022\nintegration of internal controls;\n\u2022\nentry into markets in which we have little or no direct prior experience;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key customers, management, and employees of an acquired business;\n\u2022\npotential integration or restructuring costs;\n\u2022\nthe ability to achieve operating and financial synergies; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in business, industry, or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying our rationale for pursuing the acquisition or joint venture.\nWe cannot ensure that we will be able to successfully integrate acquisitions or incorporate joint ventures that we undertake or that such acquisitions or joint ventures will perform as planned or prove to be beneficial to our business and results of operations. The occurrence of any one or more of these or other factors could cause us not to realize the benefits anticipated to result from an acquisition or a joint venture, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe prices of raw materials and commodities we use are volatile.\nOur business is subject to volatility in pricing of raw materials used in our manufacturing processes, such as steel scrap, steel bar, pig iron, aluminum, copper, molybdenum, and other metallic materials. The costs of these products are subject to inflationary and market pricing pressures, and as such, have fluctuated over the past several years. Certain raw materials and other commodities used in our operations are generally only available from a few suppliers. Although agreements with our suppliers generally contain pass-through price adjustments, we may experience increasing costs or reduced scrap sales due to changing material prices and timing. Furthermore, our suppliers\u2019 inability to handle raw material cost increases may lead to delivery delays, additional costs, production issues, or quality issues with our suppliers in the future and, accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAlthough we also maintain pass-through arrangements with most of our customers, we may not always be able to effectively offset all of our increased raw material costs. Our ability to pass through increased raw material costs to our customers may be limited, and the recovery may be less than our cost or on a delayed basis, which impacts our operating income. These pricing pressures put significant operational and financial burdens on us and our suppliers. Our suppliers\u2019 inability to absorb raw material cost increases may lead to delivery delays, additional costs, production issues, or quality issues with suppliers in the future. To the extent we are unable to offset raw material and commodity price increases and fluctuations by passing price increases to our customers, such price fluctuations or delays could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe could be materially adversely affected by any failure to maintain a competitive cost structure.\nWe believe that our strong operating margins and cash flow generation are the result of our strong customer relationships, innovative metal forming process technologies, broad product portfolio, and disciplined capital investment approach. There are many factors that could affect our ability to manage our cost structure that we are not able to control, including the need for unexpected significant capital expenditures and unexpected changes in commodity or component pricing that we are unable to pass on to our customers. As a result, we may be unable to manage our operations to profitably meet current and expected market demand. Additionally, we have substantial indebtedness of approximately $1,846.1 million as of December 31, 2016. Our inability to maintain our cost structure could adversely impact our operating margins and our results of operations.\nWe may incur significant costs if we close any of our manufacturing facilities.\nWe may, from time to time, close high cost or less efficient manufacturing facilities. If we must close any of our facilities because of the consolidation of facilities, loss of business, or cancellation of Programs for which we manufacture products, the employee severance, asset retirement, and other costs to close these facilities may be significant. In certain locations where our facilities are subject to leases, we may continue to incur significant costs in accordance with the existing lease terms. We may be unsuccessful in renegotiating these leases or we may need to make large settlements or take other actions to terminate our leases. We attempt to align production capacity with demand; however, we cannot provide any assurance that we will not close manufacturing facilities in the future, which could result in adverse publicity and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may continue to incur significant costs at our facility in Sandusky, Ohio.\nDuring 2016, the Company announced the exit of its wheel bearing business in Sandusky, Ohio and the planned closure of the Sandusky facility by early 2017. The lease term of the Sandusky facility continues to 2033 at approximately $4 million per year in lease payments. We may be unsuccessful in renegotiating the Sandusky facility lease or we may need to make settlements or take other actions to terminate this lease and related obligations.\nWe are subject to environmental and safety requirements and risks as a result of which we may incur significant costs, liabilities, and obligations.\nWe are subject to a variety of environmental and safety laws, regulations, initiatives, and permits that govern, among other things: activities or operations that may have an adverse environmental effect; soil, surface water, and groundwater contamination; the generation, storage, handling, use, disposal, and transportation of hazardous materials and waste; the emission and discharge of materials, including greenhouse gases into the environment; and health and safety. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations or permits could result in fines or sanctions, obligations to investigate or remediate existing or potential contamination, third-party property damage claims, personal injury claims, or modification or revocation of operating permits and may lead to temporary or permanent business interruptions. Environmental laws, regulations, and permits and the enforcement thereof change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent over time, which may necessitate substantial capital expenditures or operating costs or may require changes of production processes. Compliance with the requirements of laws and regulations affect ongoing operations and may increase capital costs and operating expenses, particularly if the applicable laws and regulations become increasingly stringent or more stringently enforced in the future. In addition, we may be required to use different materials in our production due to changing environmental restrictions or due to customer specifications. Material substitution may cause us to incur additional capital and operating costs.\nWe endeavor to conduct our operations according to all legal requirements, but we may not be in complete compliance with such laws and regulations at all times. We use, and in the past have used, hazardous materials and we generate, and in the past have generated, hazardous wastes. In addition, many of the locations that we own or operate used hazardous materials either before or after we began operating at those locations. We may be subject to claims under foreign, federal, state, and local statutes, and/or common law doctrines for personal injury, property damages, natural resource damages, and other damages, as well as the investigation and cleanup of soil, surface water, groundwater, and other media. Such claims may arise out of current or former activities at sites that we own or operate currently, as well as at sites that we owned or operated in the past, and at contaminated sites that have always been owned or operated by third parties. Our liability for such claims may be joint and several, so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the remediation costs or other damages, or even for the entire cost without being entitled to claim compensation from third parties. We have from time to time been subject to claims arising out of contamination at our own and other facilities and may incur such liabilities in the future. Our costs, liabilities, and obligations relating to environmental matters may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to governmental regulations that are already extensive and are growing, which will increase our costs.\nWe and the automotive industry as a whole are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to the reporting of certain claims, and those affecting taxes and levies, healthcare costs, and safety, international trade, and immigration, among other things, all of which may have a direct or indirect effect on our business. In addition, compliance with complex U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business and in some cases restricts our ability to conduct business. These regulations are numerous and sometimes conflicting, and include import and export laws, sanctioned country restrictions, competition (or antitrust) laws, anti-corruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and the U.K. Bribery Act, data privacy requirements, tax laws, and accounting requirements. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties, and sanctions against us, our officers, or our current or former employees, as well as prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nForeign, federal, state, and local regulatory and legislative bodies have proposed various legislative and regulatory measures relating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions and energy policies. Due to the uncertainty in the regulatory and legislative processes, as well as the scope of such requirements and initiatives, we cannot currently determine the effect such legislation and regulation may have on our operations or on the production of, or demand for, vehicles. Additionally, our OEM customers are subject to significant environmentally focused state, federal, and foreign laws and regulations that regulate vehicle emissions, fuel economy, and other matters related to the environmental impact of vehicles. To the extent that such laws and regulations ultimately impact automotive vehicle production, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may incur material costs related to legal proceedings.\nFrom time to time we are involved in legal proceedings, claims, or investigations that are incidental to the conduct of our business. Some of these claims allege damages against us relating to product warranties, environmental liabilities, regulatory violations, taxes, employment matters, or commercial or contractual disputes. Estimated warranty costs related to product warranties are accrued once the liability has become both probable and reasonably estimable, and we do not maintain insurance for nonconforming product recalls in the United States. We may incur substantial warranty expense related to existing or new products now or in the future or expansion in customer warranty programs. We cannot ensure that the costs, charges, and liabilities associated with legal proceedings, claims, or investigations will not be material or that those costs, charges, and liabilities will not exceed any related amounts accrued in our financial statements or be mitigated in any way by insurance. In future periods, we could be subject to cash costs or non-cash charges to earnings if any of these matters are resolved unfavorably to us.\nWe are currently, and may in the future become, subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes. These claims typically arise in the normal course of business and may include commercial or contractual disputes with our customers and suppliers, intellectual property matters, personal injury, product liability, environmental, safety, and employment claims. These proceedings and claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Workforce\nOur ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we are unable to recruit and retain key personnel.\nOur success depends, in part, on the efforts of our executive officers and other key senior managers and employees and our ability to recruit, retain, and motivate highly-skilled sales, manufacturing, and engineering personnel. Competition for skilled employees in our industry is intense, and we may not be able to successfully recruit, train, or retain qualified personnel. If we fail to recruit and retain the necessary personnel, our ability to obtain new customers and retain existing customers, develop new products, and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have entered into employment agreements with certain of our key personnel. However, we cannot ensure that these individuals will stay with us. If any of these persons were to leave our company, it could be difficult to replace them, and our operations, ability to manage day-to-day aspects of our business, and efforts to improve our cost competitiveness may be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAny failure to maintain satisfactory labor relations could subject us to work stoppages.\nApproximately 45% of our employees are members of U.S. industrial trade unions working under the terms of collective bargaining agreements or employed under international workers\u2019 councils. There can be no assurance that future negotiations with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not experience a work stoppage or other labor disruptions. Certain terms contained in existing collective bargaining agreements may reduce our flexibility, or result in increased labor costs, to close or repurpose our manufacturing facilities. In addition, there can be no assurance that future negotiations will not result in labor cost increases or other terms and conditions. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe face pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.\nAlthough most of our legacy pension and other postretirement benefit obligations were eliminated through our prior restructuring processes, we have limited pension and other postretirement benefit obligations to certain of our associates and retirees. Our ability to satisfy the funding requirements associated with our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations to our employees and retirees will depend on our cash flow from operations and our ability to access credit and the capital markets. The funding requirements of these benefit plans and the related expense reflected in our financial statements are affected by several factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and volatility, including government regulation. For example, the pensions regulator in the United Kingdom has power in certain circumstances to issue contribution notices (\u201cCNs\u201d) or financial support directions (\u201cFSDs\u201d) with respect to the underfunded United Kingdom defined benefit pension scheme (the \u201cU.K. DB Plan\u201d) which, if issued, could result in additional liabilities. Liabilities imposed under a CN or a FSD may equal the difference between the value of the assets of the U.K. DB Plan and the cost of buying out the benefits of participants of the U.K. DB Plan. In practice, the risk of a CN being imposed may inhibit our freedom to undertake certain corporate activities without first seeking the agreement of the trustees of the U.K. DB Plan. Additional security may need to be provided to the trustees of the U.K. DB Plan before certain corporate activities can be undertaken (such as the payment of an unusual dividend) and any additional funding of the U.K. DB Plan may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and the results of our operations. We also have unfunded or underfunded pension obligations in the U.S., Germany, France, Korea and Spain where similar changes in regulations or governmental actions could cause additional funding requirements.\nKey assumptions used to value our benefit obligations and the cost of providing such benefits, funding requirements and expense recognition include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on pension assets, the health care cost trend rate and assumptions underlying actuarial methods. If the actual trends in these factors are less favorable than our assumptions, we may have to contribute cash to fund our obligations under these plans, thereby reducing the funds available to fund our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. As of December 31, 2016, the funded status of our pension plans was an obligation totaling $38.3 million.\nRisks Related to the Global Nature of Our Company\nWe are subject to risks related to our global operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, 36% of our net sales were derived from sales to customers outside the United States. We have manufacturing facilities in Brazil, China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Mexico, South Korea, Spain, and the United Kingdom, and a joint venture in India, all of which accounted for 25% of our net sales for the same period. We also sell our products to customers in countries in which we do not have manufacturing facilities, such as Canada, Austria, Sweden, Hungary, and Italy. Our global operations are subject to various risks, including:\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nexposure to local economic conditions;\n\u2022\nexposure to local political conditions, including expropriation of our facilities and nationalization by a government;\n\u2022\ncompliance with export control provisions in several jurisdictions, including the United States, the European Union, and China;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations, including the laws and policies of the United States and other countries affecting trade and foreign investment;\n\u2022\ntransport availability and costs;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax law;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nincreased risk of corruption and exposure to liabilities under the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar laws;\n\u2022\ngovernment imposed investment and other restrictions or requirements;\n\u2022\nexposure to local social unrest, including any resultant acts of war, terrorism, or similar events;\n\u2022\nexposure to local public health issues and the resultant impact on economic and political conditions;\n\u2022\nhyperinflation in certain countries;\n\u2022\nincreased reliance on local suppliers that have not proven their ability to meet our requirements;\n\u2022\nthe risk of government-sponsored competition;\n\u2022\ndifficulty enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain legal systems;\n\u2022\nvariations in protection of intellectual property and other legal rights;\n\u2022\nmore expansive legal rights of workers\u2019 councils;\n\u2022\nsocial laws that prohibit or make cost-prohibitive certain restructuring actions;\n\u2022\nadverse weather and natural disasters;\n\u2022\nincreases in working capital requirements related to long supply chains or regional terms of business;\n\u2022\ncontrols on the repatriation of cash, including the imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by our subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange controls, export and import restrictions, such as antidumping duties, tariffs, and embargoes, including restrictions promulgated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury, and other trade protection regulations.\nAs we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our global operations. However, any of these factors could adversely affect our global operations and, consequently, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nExpanding our global operations and entering new geographic markets pose competitive threats and commercial risks.\nAs part of our long-term growth strategy, we seek to further expand our operations globally and enter into new geographic markets. Such growth requires investments and resources that may not be available to us as needed. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our global expansion and, if we sign new contracts, we cannot guarantee that we will meet the needs of these customers and compete favorably in these markets. If these customers experience reduced demand for their products or financial difficulties, our future prospects will be negatively affected as well, and we may not be able to recover the costs associated with such efforts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nForeign exchange rate fluctuations may affect the Company\u2019s ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings.\nAs a result of our global operations, we generate a significant portion of our net sales and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To the extent that we have significantly more costs than sales generated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, we are subject to risk if the currency in which our costs are paid appreciates against the currency in which we generate sales because the appreciation effectively increases our cost in that country. We may selectively employ derivative instruments to reduce our foreign currency exchange risk and generally hold most of our foreign cash in U.S. dollars. This strategy and these instruments may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from foreign currency variations. Additionally, the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of some of our operating entities are reported in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements. As a result, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against these other currencies generally will have a negative impact on our reported sales and profits while depreciation of the U.S. dollar against these other currencies will generally have a positive effect on reported sales and profits. Our primary currency exposures are the Euro, Mexican Peso, Korean Won, and Chinese Renminbi. Any significant decline in the value of these currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure and Our Organizational Structure\nFuture sales of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock could depress the market price of our common stock.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Shares held by our directors, executive officers, and American Securities are eligible to be sold in the public market, subject to general trading restrictions and the requirements of Rule 144. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to or could sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. Any decline in the price of shares of our common stock could impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities.\nWe have elected to take advantage of the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption to the corporate governance rules for publicly-listed companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nBecause we qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the corporate governance rules for publicly-listed companies, the majority of our directors are not independent, and our compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee are not comprised entirely of independent directors. Accordingly, should the interests of American Securities, as our controlling stockholder, differ from those of other stockholders, the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for publicly-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nAmerican Securities independently has substantial control over us and will be able to influence corporate matters with respect to us. American Securities may have interests that differ from our interests and from those of our other stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2016, American Securities directly or indirectly held approximately 76% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, American Securities is able to strongly influence the election of our directors and potentially control the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders for approval, including potential mergers or acquisitions, asset sales, and other significant corporate transactions.\nThe interests of American Securities may not coincide with the Company\u2019s or the best interests of other holders of our common stock. This concentration of voting power could also have the effect of delaying, deterring, or preventing a change of control or other business combination that might otherwise be beneficial to other holders of our common stock.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our debt obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had total indebtedness, net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, of $1,846.1 million, including $1,011.5 million and $233.3 million in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under the USD Term Loan and Euro Term Loan, respectively, and $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes. As of December 31, 2016, we had an additional $236.8 million of borrowing capacity available under the Revolving Credit Facility after giving effect to $13.2 million of outstanding letters of credit. This high level of indebtedness could have significant negative consequences, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, selling and marketing efforts, product development, future business opportunities, and the ability to pay any future dividends;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings, including and most significantly borrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities, are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds or to dispose of assets to raise funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, product development, and other corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting.\nThe occurrence of any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If we add new debt to our outstanding debt levels, the risks related to our indebtedness would increase.\nWe, our customers, or our suppliers may be unable to obtain and maintain sufficient debt financing, including working capital lines.\nInterest rate fluctuations, financial market volatility, and global credit market disruptions have made and may continue to make it difficult for companies to raise and maintain necessary operating liquidity. While we believe we have sufficient liquidity to operate, there can be no assurance that we will continue to have such ability. Our working capital requirements can vary significantly depending, in part, on the level, variability, and timing of the worldwide vehicle production of our OEM customers and the payment terms with our customers and suppliers. Our liquidity could be adversely impacted if circumstances arose causing our suppliers to suspend trade credit terms and require payment in advance or payment upon delivery. In addition, we may be required to raise capital from other sources, which may not be available to us on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts, if at all.\nMany of our customers and suppliers require significant financing to operate their businesses. Longer-term disruptions in the credit markets could further adversely affect our customers by making it increasingly difficult for them to obtain financing for their businesses and for their customers to obtain financing for vehicle purchases. If capital is not available to our customers and suppliers, or if its cost is prohibitively high, their businesses would be negatively impacted, which could result in their restructuring or even reorganization or liquidation under applicable bankruptcy laws. As a result, the need of our customers for and their ability to purchase our products may decrease, and our suppliers may increase their prices, reduce their output or change their terms of sale. Any inability of our customers to pay us for our products and services, or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, our suppliers may not be successful in generating sufficient sales or securing alternate financing arrangements and therefore, may no longer be able to supply goods and services to us. In that event, we would need to find alternate sources of these goods and services, and there is no assurance that we would be able to find such alternate sources on favorable terms, if at all. Any such disruption in our supply chain could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and deliver our products on a timely basis, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe cannot assure you that we will pay dividends on our common stock, and our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.\nOur ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock is subject to our compliance with applicable law and depends on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, level of indebtedness, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions in our debt agreements, business prospects, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Our ability to pay dividends depends on our receipt of cash dividends from our operating subsidiaries, which may further restrict our ability to pay dividends as a result of the laws of their jurisdiction of organization or agreements of our subsidiaries, including agreements governing the Senior Credit Facilities and the Registered Notes. Future agreements may also limit our ability to pay dividends. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends.\nSome provisions of Delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may deter third parties from acquiring us and diminish the value of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide for, among other things:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting and the business that can be conducted at any such meeting;\n\u2022\nprohibition on the ability of our stockholders to remove directors elected by the holders of our common stock without cause;\n\u2022\nour ability to issue additional shares of common stock and to issue preferred stock with terms that the board of directors may determine, in each case without stockholder approval (other than as specified in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation);\n\u2022\nthe absence of cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nsupermajority approval requirements for amending or repealing provisions in the amended and restated certificate of incorporation;\n\u2022\na classified board of directors;\n\u2022\na prohibition on action by written consent of stockholders following the date when American Securities ceases to beneficially own a majority or more of our outstanding shares of common stock; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations.\nThese provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our Company that is in the best interest of our minority stockholders. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging future takeover attempts. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to nominate directors for election to our board of directors and take other corporate actions.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to certain exceptions, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or any wrongdoing by, any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation (including as it may be amended from time to time) or our bylaws, (iv) any action to interpret, apply, enforce, or determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or (v) any other action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to a number of different tax uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are required to pay taxes in multiple jurisdictions. We determine the tax liability we are required to pay based on our interpretation of applicable tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we file. Corporate tax reform continues to be a priority in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. We may be subject to unfavorable changes, including retroactive changes, in the tax laws and regulations to which we are subject. We are subject to tax audits by governmental authorities in the United States and numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions, which are inherently uncertain. Changes in tax laws or regulations or the interpretation given to them may expose us to negative tax consequences, including interest payments and potential penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe mix of profits and losses in the various jurisdictions in which we conduct our business may adversely impact our overall tax rate.\nOur overall effective tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of our income or loss before tax. However, tax expenses and benefits are determined separately for each of our taxpaying entities or groups of entities that are combined for tax purposes in each jurisdiction. Losses in such jurisdictions may provide no current financial statement tax benefit. As a result, changes in the mix of projected profits and losses among jurisdictions could have a significant impact on our overall effective tax rate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 15105, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "MPG"}
