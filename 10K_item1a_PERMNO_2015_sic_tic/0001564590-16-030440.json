{"cik": "1322505", "company": "ALBIREO PHARMA, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-12-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nAn investment in shares of our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following information about these risks, together with the other information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and related notes thereto, before deciding to invest in our common stock. The occurrence of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to continue to incur losses and may never generate profits from operations or maintain profitability.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Albireo Limited\u2019s net loss was approximately $5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. As of September 30, 2016, Albireo Limited had an accumulated deficit of $14.7 million. To date, Albireo Limited has financed its operations primarily through issuances of its preference shares or convertible loan notes, upfront fees paid upon entering into or amending license agreements, payments received upon the achievement of specified milestone events under the license agreements, grants and venture debt borrowings. We have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development, including clinical trials. We have not completed the development of any drugs. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next few years as we continue our development of, and seek marketing approvals for, our product candidates, prepare for and begin the commercialization of any approved products, and add infrastructure and personnel to support our product development efforts and operations as a public company in the United States. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year.\nOur ability to generate profits from operations and thereafter to remain profitable depends heavily on:\n\u2022\nthe scope, number, progress, duration, cost, results and timing of clinical trials and nonclinical studies of our current or potential future product candidates;\n\u2022\nour ability to raise sufficient funds to support the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe outcomes and timing of regulatory reviews, approvals or other actions;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nwhether and to what extent milestone events are achieved under our license agreement with EA Pharma Co., Ltd. (formerly Ajinomoto Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd.), or EA Pharma, or any potential future licensee or collaborator;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain additional licensing, collaboration or similar arrangements on favorable terms and whether and to what extent we retain development or commercialization responsibilities under any new licensing, collaboration or similar arrangement;\n\u2022\nthe success of any other business, product or technology that we acquire or in which we invest;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022\nour ability to manufacture any approved products on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish a sales and marketing organization or suitable third-party alternatives for any approved product; and\n\u2022\nthe number and characteristics of product candidates and programs that we pursue.\nBased on our current plans, we do not expect to generate significant revenue unless and until we or a current or potential future licensee or collaborator obtains marketing approval for, and commercializes, one or more of our product candidates, which we do not expect to occur for at least the next few years. Neither we nor a licensee may ever succeed in obtaining marketing approval for, or commercializing, our product candidates and, even if we do, may never generate revenues that are significant enough to generate profits from operations. Even if we do generate profits from operations, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to generate profits from operations and remain profitable would decrease our value and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations. A decline in our value could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nOur limited operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nOur operations to date have been limited to organization and staffing, developing and securing our technology, entering into licensing arrangements for elobixibat, raising capital and undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates. We have not yet demonstrated our ability to successfully complete development of any product candidate, obtain marketing approval, manufacture a commercial scale product, or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Consequently, any predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history.\nAssuming we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we will need to transition from a company with a research and development focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays and may not be successful in such a transition.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nBased on Albireo Limited\u2019s recurring losses and expectations to incur significant expenses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future, its independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph in its report on Albireo Limited\u2019s financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may be forced to liquidate our assets and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements.\nWe will need substantial additional funding and, in particular, may not have sufficient cash to fund a planned pivotal clinical trial of A4250 for the treatment of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis to completion. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially in future periods, particularly as we advance A4250 into planned pivotal clinical development for the treatment of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis, or PFIC. We expect that our research and development expenses would increase even further if we conduct clinical trials of any or all of A4250 for the treatment of additional pediatric cholestatic liver diseases and disorders, elobixibat for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation, or CIC, or A3384 for the treatment of bile acid malabsorption, or BAM, continue our preclinical program in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, or initiate additional preclinical programs for potential future product candidates. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates that are not then subject to licensing, collaboration or similar arrangements with third parties, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing. Furthermore, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company in the United States. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts.\nWe believe that our current cash resources will be sufficient to enable us to fund a planned pivotal clinical trial of A4250 for the treatment of PFIC. Based on current plans for completing our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in children with chronic cholestasis, we expect to complete the planned pivotal PFIC trial in mid 2018. Our expectation is based on the projected cost, timing and scope of our planned research and development activities, including the planned pivotal PFIC trial, the projected receipt of contingent milestone payments under our agreement with EA Pharma for elobixibat and other assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect. This estimate assumes, among other things, that we do not obtain any additional funding through grants and clinical trial support or through new licensing, collaboration or similar arrangements. Our ability to fund a pivotal clinical trial of A4250 for the treatment of PFIC through its completion, and our future capital requirements generally, will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe costs, design, duration and any potential delays of the planned pivotal clinical trial of A4250 that may result from, among other things, the factors described below under \u201c - The likelihood that our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of A4250 in children with chronic cholestasis will be sufficient to enable a single pivotal trial to support, together with additional long-term safety data, an application for marketing approval of A4250 as a treatment for PFIC is uncertain. The uncertainty will be greater if we do not enroll a sufficient number of children with PFIC in our ongoing study.\u201d and \u201cIf we experience any of a number of possible unforeseen events in connection with our clinical trials, potential marketing approval or commercialization of our product candidates, or entry into licensing, collaboration or similar arrangements, could be delayed or prevented.\u201d;\n\u2022\nthe same factors that our ability to generate profits from operations and thereafter to remain profitable depend heavily on, as described above under \u201c- We have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to continue to incur losses and may never generate profits from operations or maintain profitability.\u201d;\n\u2022\nthe outcomes and timing of regulatory reviews, approvals or other actions;\n\u2022\nthe costs of acquiring, licensing or investing in businesses, product candidates and technologies;\n\u2022\nthe costs to maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022\nthe costs to secure or establish sales, marketing and commercial manufacturing capabilities or arrangements with third parties;\n\u2022\nour need and ability to hire additional management and scientific and medical personnel;\n\u2022\nthe costs to operate as a public company in the United States, including the need to implement additional financial and reporting systems and other internal systems and infrastructure for our business;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our product candidates, to the extent any are approved for commercial sale; and\n\u2022\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments.\nConducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that will not be commercially available for at least the next few years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. In particular, if we do not have sufficient funds to complete the planned pivotal clinical trial of A4250 for the treatment of PFIC, we will be required to obtain additional financing in order to complete that trial. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations, even if we believe that we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. Additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. The unavailability of additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all, would have an adverse effect on your investment.\nLimitations on the ability of smaller reporting companies to sell shares under a Form S-3 shelf registration statement may interfere with our ability to execute financing transactions quickly or at all.\nOur ability to raise capital using a shelf registration statement may be limited by, among other things, current SEC rules and regulations. Under these rules and regulations, we must meet certain requirements to use a Form S-3 registration statement to raise capital without restriction as to the amount of the market value of securities sold under the Form S-3 registration statement. One such requirement is that the market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates, or public float, be at least $75 million as of a date within 60 days prior to the date on which the Form S-3 is filed (and the date of any Form 10-K filing thereafter by us, which is deemed a re-evaluation date). If we do not meet that requirement, then the aggregate market value of securities sold by us in a primary offering under a Form S-3 in any 12-month period is limited to an aggregate of one-third of our public float. SEC rules and regulations require that we periodically re-evaluate the value of our public float, and if, at a re-evaluation date, our public float is less than $75 million, we would become subject to the one-third of public float limitation described above.\nIf our ability to utilize a Form S-3 registration statement is restricted under these rules, we could elect to raise capital pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, or under a Form S-1 registration statement, but either of these alternatives would likely increase the cost of raising additional capital compared with the use of a Form S-3 registration statement. Furthermore, because of these limitations on primary securities offerings under a Form S-3 and the increased likelihood of greater costs and potential delays associated with the alternatives to using a Form S-3, the terms of any financing transaction that we are able to conduct may be less favorable or may cause us to be unable to obtain capital in a timely manner.\nIn addition, under current SEC rules and regulations, our common stock must be listed on a national securities exchange in order to utilize a Form S-3 registration statement (i) for a primary offering, if our public float is not at least $75 million as of a date within 60 days prior to the date on which the securities are sold under the Form S-3, or a re-evaluation date, whichever is later, and (ii) to register the resale of our securities by persons other than us. While our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such listing.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our investors, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, licensing, collaboration or similar arrangements, grants and debt financings. We do not have any committed external source of funds. We may seek to raise additional capital at any time. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a holder of our common stock. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends or other distributions.\nIf we raise additional funds through licensing, collaboration or similar arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research and development programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nRisks Related to the Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nWe depend heavily on the success of our lead product candidate, A4250, which we are developing initially for the treatment of PFIC and potentially also for other pediatric cholestatic liver diseases and disorders. We also depend on the success of our product candidate elobixibat, which our licensee EA Pharma is developing in Japan for the treatment of CIC. If we are unable to commercialize A4250 or experience significant delays in doing so, or if EA Pharma is unable to commercialize elobixibat in Japan or experiences significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nA4250 is in Phase 2 clinical development. Elobixibat has completed a Phase 3 clinical trial and is being evaluated in an ongoing long-term safety clinical trial in Japan. Our other clinical-stage product candidate, A3384, is in Phase 2 development. We are currently evaluating whether we will seek to identify and enter into a license or other partnering transaction with a third party for elobixibat in the United States or Europe. Whether or not we elect to seek such a transaction, and whether or not we identify and successfully enter into a suitable licensing, collaboration or similar arrangement with a third party for a particular region, we do not currently anticipate that we will conduct future clinical trials of elobixibat independently. We also do not anticipate conducting future clinical trials of A3384 unless and until we obtain additional capital, whether from our license agreement with EA Pharma for elobixibat, from potential future licensing, collaboration or similar arrangements or from any future offering of our debt or equity securities.\nOur ability to generate product revenues, which may not occur for at least the next few years, if at all, will depend heavily on the successful development and commercialization of A4250 as a treatment of PFIC and potentially as a treatment for other pediatric cholestatic liver diseases and disorders. Our ability to generate product revenues may also depend on the successful development and commercialization of A3384 to treat BAM or of elobixibat in the United States or Europe to treat CIC. The success of each of these product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional capital, whether from our license agreement with EA Pharma for elobixibat, from potential future licensing, collaboration or similar arrangements or from any future offering of our debt or equity securities;\n\u2022\nour ability to identify and enter into potential future licenses or other collaboration arrangements with third parties and the terms of the arrangements;\n\u2022\nsuccessful completion of clinical development;\n\u2022\nreceipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nestablishing commercial manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n\u2022\nobtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity;\n\u2022\nprotecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022\nestablishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u2022\ngenerating commercial sales of A4250, elobixibat or A3384, as applicable, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u2022\nacceptance of A4250, elobixibat or A3384, as applicable, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\u2022\neffectively competing with other therapies; and\n\u2022\nmaintaining an acceptable safety profile of A4250, elobixibat or A3384, as applicable, following approval.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize A4250, elobixibat or A3384, which would materially harm our business.\nIf clinical trials of our product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, or the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, or do not otherwise produce favorable results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of A4250 or any of our other product candidates.\nIn connection with obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate, we must complete preclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical trials are expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and are uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials. In particular, the small number of subjects and patients in our early clinical trials may make the results of these clinical trials less predictive of the outcome of later clinical trials. The design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product, and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced or completed. There is no assurance that we will be able to design and execute a clinical trial to support marketing approval. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products.\nWe are developing A4250 initially for PFIC, and there is limited clinical experience in PFIC. We may also conduct future development of A4250 for other pediatric cholestatic liver diseases and disorders for which there is likewise limited clinical experience. In some cases, our ongoing or planned clinical trials have used and will use novel endpoints and measurement methodologies with which the FDA, EMA and other regulatory authorities have limited or no experience. The degree of novelty of these endpoints and methodologies may delay or prevent regulatory approval. For example, our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of A4250 in children with chronic cholestasis and the concluded investigator-initiated Phase 2 clinical trial of A4250 in adults with primary biliary cholangitis (formerly known as primary biliary cirrhosis), or PBC, each designates change in pruritus from baseline as an endpoint, and it is possible that change from baseline in pruritus will be the primary or a key secondary endpoint in future clinical trials of A4250. Change in pruritus from baseline is assessed using patient-reported or, in the case of young children, caregiver-reported outcome instruments. Because the assessment of pruritus relies on subjective patient or caregiver feedback, it is inherently difficult to evaluate and measure consistently. The measure of pruritus can be influenced by factors outside of our control and can vary widely from measurement point to measurement point for a particular patient, from patient to patient and from site to site within a clinical trial. Moreover, patients given an inactive comparator, or placebo, in a clinical trial may perceive a change in pruritus from baseline that is comparable to the change experienced by patients given A4250, which would obscure the effect of A4250.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of A4250, or any of our other product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete our clinical trials or other testing, or if the results of these clinical trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u2022\nbe delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nnot obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u2022\nobtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as we intended or desired;\n\u2022\nobtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings, including boxed warnings;\n\u2022\nbe subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements or restrictions; or\n\u2022\nhave the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nThe clinical trial designs, endpoints and outcomes that will be required to obtain marketing approval of a drug to treat PFIC, or to treat BAM, are uncertain. We may never receive marketing approval for A4250 or A3384 as a treatment for these indications.\nNo product is currently approved for the treatment of either of PFIC or BAM. Accordingly, there is not a well-established development path that, with positive outcomes in clinical trials, would be reasonably assured of receiving marketing approval for these indications. In particular, we plan to use our ongoing clinical trial of A4250 in children with chronic cholestasis to support a\npotentially pivotal clinical trial designed to establish the efficacy of A4250 to support, together with additional long-term safety data, an application for regulatory approval as a treatment for PFIC. The FDA or any regulatory authority outside of the United States may determine that the designs or endpoints of any potentially pivotal trial that we conduct, or that the outcome shown on any particular endpoint in any potentially pivotal trial that we conduct, are not sufficient to establish a clinically meaningful benefit for A4250 in the treatment of PFIC or otherwise to support approval, even if the primary endpoint or endpoints of the trial is or are met with statistical significance. If this occurs, our business would be materially harmed. Moreover, if the FDA requires us to conduct additional clinical trials beyond the ones that we currently contemplate in order to support regulatory approval in the United States of A4250 in PFIC, our business will be materially harmed.\nLikewise, if we conduct any future clinical trial designed to support marketing approval of A3384 as a treatment for BAM, the FDA or any regulatory authority outside of the United States may determine that the designs or endpoints of the trial, or that the outcomes shown on any particular endpoints in the trial, are not sufficient to establish a clinically meaningful benefit for A3384 in the treatment of BAM or otherwise to support approval, even if the primary endpoint or endpoints of the trial is met with statistical significance.\nPreliminary data from completed cohorts of our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of A4250 in children with chronic cholestasis may not be consistent with data from any later cohort of the trial.\nWe are conducting an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of A4250 in children with chronic cholestasis, which is an open label study. Data from the trial becomes available on a cohort-by-cohort basis, but will not become final until the trial database is locked upon the completion of all cohorts. Because this is an open label study, preliminary data is available from the 20 patients comprising the five cohorts that have completed as of December 20, 2016. These data show a reduction in serum bile acids in a substantial majority of patients, as well as a favorable trend in reduction of pruritus. In addition, A4250 has exhibited a favorable tolerability profile through the first five cohorts of the trial. However, there can be no assurance that data from the remaining cohort in the trial will be favorable. If data from the trial as a whole is, when completed, not sufficiently favorable, we will not be able to advance A4250 into a planned pivotal clinical trial in PFIC or any other indication, A4250 will not receive marketing approval for the treatment of PFIC or any other indication, and our business will be materially harmed. Moreover, we cannot assure you that the final results of the trial, even if favorable, will be replicated in the planned pivotal trial of A4250 in PFIC or in any future trials of A4250 in any other pediatric cholestatic liver disease or disorder.\nFavorable results seen in the concluded Phase 2 clinical trial of A4250 in PBC patients may not be predictive of results in later clinical trials of A4250 in a different indication or that involve a different number of patients, different dosing regimens and durations, different outcome measures or other differences in design or execution.\nA number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in later-stage clinical trials, even after promising results in earlier trials or in preclinical studies. Similarly, companies have experienced disappointing outcomes in later phases of a multiphase clinical trial, even after promising results in an early phase of the trial. A4250 has previously been evaluated in an investigator-initiated Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of PBC. We facilitated the trial, which was concluded in the fourth quarter of 2016. In a planned interim analysis of data from the first cohort of the trial, pruritus was substantially reduced for all five subjects who received A4250 and serum bile acid levels for the three subjects who completed the trial were reduced on average by approximately 50%. Any or all of the ongoing and planned future trials of A4250 may involve a greater number of patients, a different dosing regimen or duration and other differences in trial design, in addition to the difference in patient population, compared with the PBC trial. If the favorable findings on pruritus and serum bile acids seen in the PBC trial or the favorable preliminary data on pruritus and serum bile acids from completed cohorts of our ongoing Phase 2 trial of A4250 in children with chronic cholestasis are not replicated in the final data from our ongoing chronic cholestasis trial or in planned future clinical trials of A4250 in PFIC or any other pediatric cholestatic liver disease or disorder, we may not obtain marketing approval for A4250 to treat any of these indications, in which case our business would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are currently designing our planned pivotal trial of A4250 as a treatment for PFIC, including evaluating various potential endpoints to designate as the primary endpoint, whether alone or together with another co-primary endpoint. It is possible that change from baseline in pruritus will be the primary or a key secondary endpoint in the planned trial. It is customary to use patient-reported or caregiver-reported outcome measures to qualify and assess pruritus in clinical trials, but the specific measures can vary from trial to trial. For example, the pruritus scales that were used in the PBC trial are not the same as the scales we are using in our ongoing trial in children with chronic cholestasis, except that the visual analogue scale of itching, known as VAS-itch, is common to both trials. If we decide to use change from baseline in pruritus as a primary or a key secondary endpoint in our planned pivotal trial of A4250 as a treatment for PFIC, we will likely use one or more measures, including a patient-reported or caregiver-reported outcome measures that we are currently developing for consideration by applicable regulatory authorities, that employ or rely on different questions or assessments or are otherwise different than the pruritus measures that we are using in our ongoing trial in children with chronic cholestasis. Any decision by us to use different measures of pruritus in future trials may reduce the likelihood that the preliminary data\nfrom the completed cohorts in our ongoing trial of A4250 in children with chronic cholestasis or the results observed in the concluded PBC trial of A4250 will be predictive of results in the future trials. Moreover, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may determine that the measure for pruritus that we choose for our planned pivotal trial in PFIC or any future trial in any other pediatric cholestatic liver disease or disorder was not applied by clinical investigators in the applicable trial sufficiently consistently, or was not sufficiently sensitive to detect varying degrees of pruritus in the applicable trial, to support regulatory approval of A4250 in any or all of these indications.\nThe likelihood that our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of A4250 in children with chronic cholestasis will be sufficient to enable a single pivotal trial to support, together with additional long-term safety data, an application for marketing approval of A4250 as a treatment for PFIC is uncertain. The uncertainty will be greater if we do not enroll a sufficient number of children with PFIC in our ongoing study.\nWe plan to seek concurrence from the FDA and regulatory authorities outside the United States that a single pivotal clinical trial in patients with PFIC will be sufficient to establish the efficacy of A4250 to support, together with additional long-term safety data, an application for regulatory approval as a treatment for PFIC. The likelihood that the FDA or any regulatory authority outside the United States will concur with our plan is uncertain. The FDA or any other regulatory authority may instead determine that multiple pivotal clinical trials are required to establish the efficacy of A4250 as a treatment for PFIC, without regard to the final outcomes of our ongoing Phase 2 study in children. The risk that the FDA or any other regulatory authority will take this position may be even higher if we select a primary endpoint for our planned pivotal trial in PFIC for which there is only limited data generated in our ongoing Phase 2 pediatric trial. If the FDA or a regulatory authority outside of the United States takes this position, it would result in a more expensive and potentially longer development program for A4250 than we currently contemplate, which could delay our ability to generate product revenues with A4250, interfere with our ability to enter into any potential licensing or collaboration arrangements with respect to this program, cause our value to decline, and limit our ability to obtain additional financing that may be necessary to complete the planned pivotal program.\nIn addition, we are enrolling in our ongoing study children with chronic cholestasis caused by any of a number of different liver conditions, including PFIC, biliary atresia, Alagille syndrome, or ALGS, and sclerosing cholangitis. As a result of these enrollment criteria, the number of PFIC patients who will participate in the ongoing Phase 2 trial is uncertain. Through the first five cohorts of the ongoing trial, nine PFIC patients have been enrolled. If, following completion of the ongoing trial, the FDA or any regulatory authority outside of the United States determines that the number of patients with PFIC in the trial was insufficient, or that the number of patients with PFIC in any particular age range was insufficient, it is more likely that the applicable regulatory authority will require that we conduct more than our planned single pivotal trial in PFIC to establish the efficacy of A4250 to support marketing approval for A4250 as a treatment for PFIC.\nIf we experience new or additional delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in our clinical trials of A4250, our receipt of marketing approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nRecruiting patients for orphan pediatric liver diseases is challenging, and we have experienced enrollment delays in clinical trials of A4250. If we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in clinical trials of our product candidates, including in particular our ongoing pediatric trial of A4250 and our planned pivotal trial of A4250 as a treatment for PFIC, we may not be able to initiate or continue the clinical trials. Potential clinical trial participants may not be adequately diagnosed or identified with the diseases that we are targeting and may not meet the inclusion criteria for our trials. PFIC and other pediatric cholestatic liver diseases or disorders for which we may develop A4250 is a rare disease or disorder with a limited patient population, which could result in slow enrollment of clinical trial participants. Further, there are only a limited number of specialist physicians that treat these diseases and disorders, and major clinical centers that treat these diseases and disorders are concentrated in a few geographic regions.\nPatient enrollment is affected by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nsize of the target patient population;\n\u2022\nseverity of the disease or disorder under investigation;\n\u2022\neligibility criteria for the clinical trial in question;\n\u2022\nother clinical trials being conducted at the same time involving patients who have the disease or disorder under investigation;\n\u2022\nperceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u2022\napproval and availability of other therapies to treat the disease or disorder that is being investigated in the clinical trial;\n\u2022\nefforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u2022\npatient referral practices of physicians;\n\u2022\nthe ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and\n\u2022\nproximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nEnrollment delays in our ongoing or planned clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which would cause our value to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing. Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our ongoing or planned clinical trials of A4250, or any of our other product candidates, would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether.\nIf the commercial opportunity in PFIC is smaller than we anticipate, or if we elect to develop A4250 to treat only a specific subpopulation of patients with PFIC, our future revenue from A4250 will be adversely affected and our business will suffer.\nIf the size of the commercial opportunities in any of our target indications is smaller than we anticipate, we may not be able to achieve profitability and growth. We are developing A4250 initially as a treatment for PFIC and potentially also as a treatment for other pediatric cholestatic liver diseases and disorders. PFIC and these other diseases and disorders are each rare, with a limited patient population. Moreover, we expect that the PFIC patient candidates for A4250 are only a subset of the overall patient population, specifically patients who have not yet received partial external bile diversion, or PEBD, surgery or liver transplant surgery or patients who have had PEBD reversal surgery. In addition, there are different subtypes of PFIC and the beneficial effects of A4250 may vary among patients with different subtypes. We may ultimately elect to develop A4250 as a treatment for some but not all of the subtypes.\nIt is critical to our ability to grow and become profitable that we successfully identify patients with these rare cholestatic liver diseases and disorders. Our projections of the number of people who have PFIC or our other target cholestatic liver diseases and disorders, as well as the subset who have the potential to benefit from treatment with A4250, are based on a variety of sources, including third-party estimates and analyses in the scientific literature, and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new information may emerge that changes our estimate of the prevalence of these diseases or the number of patient candidates for A4250. The effort to identify patients with PFIC or our other potential target indications is at an early stage, and we cannot accurately predict the number of patients for whom treatment might be possible. Additionally, the potentially addressable patient population for A4250 may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with A4250, and new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, which would adversely affect our results of operations and our business. Further, even if we obtain significant market share for A4250, we may never achieve profitability because the potential target patient population for A4250 is small.\nIf we experience any of a number of possible unforeseen events in connection with our clinical trials, potential marketing approval or commercialization of our product candidates, or entry into licensing, collaboration or similar arrangements, could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates, including:\n\u2022\nclinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u2022\nthe number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to recruit and enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials to ensure adequate statistical power to detect any statistically significant treatment effects;\n\u2022\nour third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022\nregulators, institutional review boards or independent ethics committees may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022\nwe may experience delays in reaching or fail to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites;\n\u2022\nwe may have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our product candidates for various reasons, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or undesirable side effects;\n\u2022\nregulators, institutional review boards or independent ethics committees may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\nthe cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nthe supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate; and\n\u2022\nour product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators, regulators, institutional review boards or independent ethics committees to suspend or terminate the clinical trials.\nFor example, in March 2015, Ferring International Center S.A., or Ferring, stopped early two Phase 3 clinical trials of elobixibat that Ferring had been conducting pursuant to a now-terminated license agreement with us due to an issue related to the distribution of study drug to study sites that was unrelated to the performance of elobixibat. We were unable as a result of the stopping of the trials to obtain data for the total number of patients for which the trials were designed, and the abbreviated trials are not sufficient to support an application for marketing approval.\nOur product development costs will increase if we experience delays in testing or marketing approvals. We do not know whether any preclinical tests or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant preclinical study or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, which may harm our business and results of operations.\nThe benefit of IBAT inhibition in the potential treatment for PFIC or any of our other target indications is unproven, and we do not know whether we will be able to develop any products of commercial value for these indications.\nA4250 is an ileal bile acid transporter, or IBAT, inhibitor. There is no marketed drug that relies on IBAT inhibition for the treatment of PFIC or any other indication for which we plan to develop A4250. Shire plc, or Shire, reported in 2015 and 2016 that its product candidate for the treatment of PFIC and other rare liver diseases, SHP625, which has been reported to be an IBAT inhibitor, failed to meet the respective primary endpoints of Phase 2 clinical trials in multiple adult and pediatric indications. We cannot assure you that we will be able to replicate or improve upon our findings from preclinical studies and early clinical trials in later-stage clinical trials of A4250 for the treatment of PFIC or any of our other target indications or that our focus on IBAT inhibition as a medically useful mechanism of action will result in the development of a commercially viable drug that safely and effectively treats PFIC or any of our other target indications.\nIf the FDA concludes that more clinical or nonclinical data than we currently anticipate is required to support the approval of A3384 for the treatment of BAM under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetics Act, or Section 505(b)(2), or if the requirements for A3384 under Section 505(b)(2) are not as we expect, the approval pathway for A3384 will likely take significantly longer, cost significantly more and entail significantly greater complications and risks than anticipated, and in either case may not be successful.\nWe expect that we may seek FDA approval for A3384 for the treatment of BAM through the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, added Section 505(b)(2) to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of a new drug application, or NDA, where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies that were not conducted by or for the applicant, and for which the applicant has not received a right of reference, which could expedite the development program for A3384 by potentially decreasing the amount of clinical and preclinical data that we would need to generate in order to obtain FDA approval. However, the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway does not preclude the possibility that additional clinical trials or nonclinical studies may be required; for example, for new indications where the applicant cannot rely on published literature or the FDA\u2019s finding of safety and effectiveness. If the FDA requires more data to support the approval of A3384 to treat BAM than we currently anticipate, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for A3384, and complications and risks associated with A3384, would likely substantially increase. Moreover, if we are unable to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for any reason, new competitive products could reach the market more quickly than A3384, which would likely harm our competitive position and prospects. Even if we are allowed to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, we cannot assure you that A3384 will receive the requisite approvals for commercialization.\nIn addition, notwithstanding the approval of a number of products by the FDA under Section 505(b)(2) over the last few years, certain competitors and others have objected to the FDA\u2019s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA\u2019s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is successfully challenged, the FDA may be required to change its 505(b)(2) policies and practices, which could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any NDA that we submit under Section 505(b)(2). In addition, the pharmaceutical\nindustry is highly competitive, and Section 505(b)(2) NDAs are subject to special requirements designed to protect the patent rights of sponsors of previously approved drugs that are referenced in a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. These requirements may give rise to patent litigation and mandatory delays in approval of our 505(b)(2) NDA for up to 30 months depending on the outcome of any litigation. It is not uncommon for a manufacturer of an approved product to file a citizen petition with the FDA seeking to delay approval of, or impose additional approval requirements for, pending competing products. If successful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of the new product. However, even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while it considers and responds to the petition. In addition, even if we are able to utilize the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, there is no guarantee this would ultimately lead to faster product development or earlier approval. Moreover, even if A3384 is approved under Section 505(b)(2), the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which A3384 may be marketed or to other conditions of approval, or may contain requirements for costly post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the products.\nBAM is not easily diagnosed and the number of patients suffering from BAM has not been established with precision. If the actual number of patients is smaller than we estimate, we may not be able to recruit patients into our clinical trial in this indication in a timely manner or at all, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for A3384 to treat this condition.\nBAM is not easily diagnosed. There is no patient registry or other method of establishing with precision the actual number of patients with BAM in any geography. The best diagnostic method currently, the 75Se-Homocholic Acid Taurine test, is not available in many countries and evaluation of bile acid synthesis markers, such as FGF19, and the bile acid intermediate C4 is not a routine diagnostic test. We estimate the prevalence of BAM to be approximately 1.3 million people in the United States and approximately 2.2 million people in the European Union. We derive our estimated prevalence from a reported estimate of the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea, or IBS-D, and published third-party studies that suggest approximately one-third of IBS-D patients have BAM. If the estimates on which we have relied are not accurate or if the results of studies on which we have relied are outdated, our estimate of the number of patients with BAM may be inaccurate, we may not be able to recruit patients into any future clinical trial of A3384 in BAM in a timely manner, or at all, and the commercial opportunity for A3384 may be smaller than we anticipate.\nIf serious or unacceptable side effects are identified during the development of A4250, elobixibat or A3384 or any other product candidate, we may need to abandon or limit our development of that product candidate.\nAll of our product candidates are in clinical or preclinical development and their risk of failure is high. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive marketing approval. If our product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects or have other unexpected, unacceptable characteristics, we may need to abandon their development or limit development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Many investigational products that initially showed promise in clinical or earlier stage testing have later been found to cause side effects or other safety issues that prevented further development.\nFor example, in the concluded Phase 2 clinical trial of A4250 in PBC, two of the five patients dropped out of the trial due to diarrhea, an effect sometimes associated with the IBAT inhibition mechanism. If the diarrhea and associated dropout rate observed in the PBC trial is predictive of an inadequate tolerability profile of A4250, the overall commercial opportunity for A4250 may be lower than we expect. Even if we receive regulatory approval for A4250, if the approved dose of A4250 is not well tolerated, A4250 may not achieve market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors or others in the medical community, which would materially and adversely affect our business.\nEven if A4250, elobixibat or A3384 or any potential future product candidate of ours receives marketing approval, it may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nIf A4250, elobixibat, A3384 or any potential future product candidate of ours receives marketing approval, the approved product may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. If an approved product does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues or any profits from operations. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments or competitive products;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022\nwhether physicians will be willing to prescribe A4250 to patients with PFIC if the primary endpoint in our pivotal clinical trial or trials of A4250 for the treatment of PFIC is the reduction of pruritus or a surrogate measure, as opposed to a direct measure of reducing or eliminating progressive liver disease;\n\u2022\nthe ability to offer our product candidates for sale at competitive prices;\n\u2022\nconvenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u2022\nthe strength of marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022\nthe adequacy of supply of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement;\n\u2022\nthe timing of any such marketing approval in relation to other product approvals;\n\u2022\nsupport from patient advocacy groups; and\n\u2022\nany restrictions on concomitant use of other medications.\nOur ability to negotiate, secure and maintain third-party coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates may be affected by political, economic and regulatory developments in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions. Governments continue to impose cost containment measures, and third-party payors are increasingly challenging prices charged for medicines and examining their cost effectiveness, in addition to their safety and efficacy. These and other similar developments could significantly limit the degree of market acceptance of A4250, elobixibat or A3384 or any potential future product candidate of ours that receives marketing approval.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell A4250 or any of our other current or potential future product candidates, we may not be successful in commercializing the applicable product candidate if it receives marketing approval.\nWe do not have a sales or marketing infrastructure and have no experience as a company in the sale or marketing of pharmaceutical products. To achieve commercial success for any approved product, we must either develop a sales and marketing organization or outsource these functions to third parties. If we receive marketing approval in the United States or Europe for A4250 to treat PFIC or any other pediatric cholestatic liver disease or disorder, we plan to build the capabilities to commercialize A4250 in the approved indication(s) in the applicable region with our own focused, specialized sales force. Outside of the United States and Europe, we plan to selectively utilize collaboration, distribution or other marketing arrangements with third parties to commercialize A4250. Also, we intend to selectively seek licensing, collaboration or similar arrangements to assist us in furthering the development or commercialization of product candidates, such as elobixibat and A3384, targeting large primary care markets that must be served by large sales and marketing organizations. There are risks involved with establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities and entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establishes marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products on our own include:\n\u2022\nour inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022\nthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future products;\n\u2022\nthe lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u2022\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nIf we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales and marketing services, our product revenues or the profitability of these product revenues are likely to be lower than if we were to market and sell any products that we develop ourselves. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates or may be unable to do so on terms that are acceptable to us. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products to treat our target indications or markets before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our current product candidates and any products we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide.\nCompetitors may also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining approvals from regulatory authorities and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies that may be complementary to or necessary for our programs.\nOur commercial opportunities could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, have fewer or less severe side effects, are approved for broader indications or patient populations, or are more convenient or less expensive than any products that we develop and commercialize. Our competitors may also obtain marketing approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our products, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.\nIn particular, we are aware of other companies that are developing product candidates that, like our product candidates A4250 and elobixibat, act via IBAT inhibition. We believe that Shire\u2019s SHP625, formerly known as LUM001, is advancing into Phase 2/3 development as a treatment for PFIC and is in Phase 2 development as a treatment for ALGS. In June 2016, Shire announced that the FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation for SHP625 for PFIC, type 2. We also believe that GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s GSK2330672 is in Phase 2 clinical development as a treatment for PBC and that Shire\u2019s SHP626 is in Phase 1 development as a treatment for NASH.\nIf approved, our product candidates will compete for a share of the existing market with numerous other products. We believe that the primary competitive products for use in indications that we are currently targeting with our most advanced product candidates include the following.\n\u2022\nFor PFIC and many other cholestatic liver diseases, there are no approved drug treatments. First-line treatment for PFIC is typically off-label ursodeoxycholic acid, or UDCA, which is approved in the United States and elsewhere for the treatment of PBC. PFIC patients often require surgical intervention such as PEBD surgery or liver transplant. As noted above, we believe Shire\u2019s SHP625 is advancing into Phase 2/3 clinical development in PFIC. In addition, we believe that Intercept Pharmaceuticals\u2019 obeticholic acid, which was recently approved by the FDA in combination with UDCA, or as a monotherapy for patients unable to tolerate UDCA, to treat PBC, is in Phase 2 development as a treatment for biliary atresia.\n\u2022\nFor the pruritus that is characteristic of many cholestatic liver diseases, symptomatic off-label treatment with: UDCA; bile acid sequestrants, such as generic cholestyramine (as Questran in the United States and as Colestyr, Efensol, Ipocol, Kolestran, Lipocol, olestyr, Prevalite or Quantalan in various other countries), marketed by Upsher-Smith Laboratories, Inc., Par Pharmaceutical Companies, Inc. and Sandoz, the generic pharmaceuticals division of Novartis AG; rifampin, an antibiotic derivative; or naltrexone, an opioid antagonist.\n\u2022\nFor CIC: linaclotide, a guanylate cyclase-C agonist marketed by Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Allergan plc in the United States as Linzess and in Europe (for a related condition, irritable bowel syndrome with constipation, or IBS-C) as Constella and for which a marketing application has been filed by Astellas Pharma Inc. in Japan for IBS-C; lubiprostone, a type-2 chloride channel marketed as Amitiza by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited in the United States and select countries in Europe and by Mylan N.V. in Japan; prucalopride, a motility agent marketed by Shire in the European Union as Resolor; and numerous OTC products, including psyllium husk (such as Metamucil), methylcellulose (such as Citrucel), calcium polycarbophil (such as FiberCon), lactulose (such as Cephulac), polyethylene glycol (such as MiraLax), sennosides (such as Exlax), bisacodyl (such as Ducolax), docusate sodium (such as Colace), magnesium hydroxide (such as Milk of Magnesia), saline enemas (such as Fleet) and sorbitol.\n\u2022\nIn addition, Synergy Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has a product candidate known as plecanatide, a guanylate cyclase-C agonist, for which it has filed an NDA in the United States to treat CIC and for which it has completed a Phase 3\nclinical trial in IBS-C. Ardelyx, Inc. has a product candidate, tenapanor, a sodium transporter NHE3 inhibitor that is in Phase 3 clinical development to treat IBS-C.\n\u2022\nFor BAM, there is no approved drug treatment. Off-label treatments include: bile acid sequestrants, such as immediate release cholestyramine (which is approved in some countries in Europe to treat diarrhea associated with certain GI conditions), colestipol and colesevelam, a cholesterol-lowering medicine marketed by Daiichi Sankyo Inc. as Welchol in the United States and by Genzyme Europe B.V. as Cholestagel in the European Union. In addition, obeticholic acid has previously been studied by Intercept in a Phase 2 clinical trial as a treatment for BAM.\nPatients with BAM following ileal resection surgery may be treated with a low-fat diet supplemented with medium-chain triglycerides or cholylsarcosine, a synthetic cholic acid conjugate. Patients with BAM secondary to Crohn\u2019s ileitis may be treated with glucocorticoid, a steroid hormone. Microscopic colitis patients may be given budesonide, a glucocorticoid steroid. Patients with BAM secondary to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth may require antibiotic therapy.\nEven if we are able to commercialize A4250, elobixibat, A3384 or any other product candidate that we develop, the product may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which would harm our business.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted and, in some markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval.\nOur ability to commercialize A4250, elobixibat, A3384 or any other product candidate successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and other third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the U.S. and E.U. healthcare industries and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for A4250, elobixibat, A3384 or any other product that we commercialize and, if coverage and reimbursement is available, the level of reimbursement. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Obtaining and maintaining adequate reimbursement for A4250 may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices typically associated with drugs directed at smaller populations of patients. In addition, third-party payors are likely to impose strict requirements for reimbursement of a higher priced drug, and any launch of a competitive product is likely to create downward pressure on the price initially charged. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to a limited degree, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the applicable regulatory authority. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, intellectual property, manufacturing, sale and distribution expenses. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs, and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. In the United States, third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. In the European Union, reference pricing systems and other measures may lead to cost containment and reduced prices. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.\nGovernments outside the United States tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our revenues, if any.\nIn some countries, particularly the member states of the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various E.U. member states and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. In some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. Publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be adversely affected.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any products that we may develop. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\nreduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for any products that we may develop;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\nsignificant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to clinical trial participants or patients;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue;\n\u2022\nincreased insurance costs; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nWe have separate liability insurance policies that cover each of our ongoing clinical trials. These policies provide coverage in varying amounts, up to a maximum of \u20ac5.0 million in the aggregate for the applicable clinical trial. The amount of insurance that we currently hold may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We will need to increase our insurance coverage when and if we begin conducting more expansive clinical development of, or commercializing, A4250, elobixibat, A3384 or any potential future product candidate of ours. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate and fail to capitalize on product candidates that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on specific product candidates. Currently, we are focusing our resources predominantly on A4250. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with elobixibat, A3384 or potential future product candidates that later could prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates may not yield any commercially viable products.\nWe have historically based its research and development efforts on IBAT inhibitors, including A4250 and elobixibat, to treat cholestatic liver diseases and CIC and on our proprietary formulations of an established bile acid sequestrant, A3384, to treat BAM. Notwithstanding our investment to date and anticipated future investment, we have not yet developed, and may never successfully develop, any marketed drugs using these approaches. As a result of pursuing the development of product candidates using our proprietary technologies, we may fail to develop product candidates or address indications based on other scientific approaches that may offer greater commercial potential or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources. These programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development.\nIf we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through licensing, collaboration or other royalty or similar arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely on EA Pharma for the successful development and commercialization of elobixibat to treat chronic constipation in Japan and other select markets in Asia.\nWe entered into a license agreement with EA Pharma for elobixibat in April 2012. We cannot predict the ultimate success of the arrangement. The agreement provides for milestone payments to us if specified regulatory and commercial milestone events are achieved and provides us with royalty-based revenue if elobixibat is successfully commercialized. If elobixibat receives marketing approval in Japan, EA Pharma plans to co-market elobixibat in Japan with another company, Mochida Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, or Mochida.\nEA Pharma is responsible for all future development and potential commercialization of elobixibat in its licensed field (namely, all prophylactic or therapeutic uses of a pharmaceutical product for gastrointestinal diseases and disorders, symptoms of constipation of all causes or postoperative ileus, in colonoscopy cleansing procedures and, in specified circumstances, select liver diseases) in Japan, Indonesia, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam, and has substantial control over the conduct and timing of development efforts with respect to elobixibat in these countries. We have little control over the amount and timing of resources that EA Pharma devotes, or Mochida devotes, to the development of elobixibat. If EA Pharma or Mochida fails to devote sufficient financial and other resources, the development and potential commercialization of elobixibat in Japan and otherwise in EA Pharma\u2019s licensed territory would be adversely affected. This would result in a delay in milestone payments to us and, if marketing approval for elobixibat in EA Pharma\u2019s licensed territory is obtained, royalties that we could receive on any future elobixibat product sales.\nEA Pharma has the right to terminate the elobixibat agreement on a country-by-country basis or in its entirety for an uncured material breach by us or in specified bankruptcy or similar events. EA Pharma also has the right, with 180 days\u2019 notice, to terminate the agreement in its entirety or on a country-by-country basis (except for Japan) for any reason.\nIf EA Pharma terminates the elobixibat agreement at any time, for any reason, it would negatively impact our development of elobixibat in Japan and otherwise in EA Pharma\u2019s licensed territory, would materially harm our business and could accelerate our need for additional capital. In particular, we would have to fund any further clinical development and commercialization of elobixibat in Japan on our own, seek another licensee or collaborator for clinical development and commercialization or abandon the development and commercialization of elobixibat in Japan.\nIf we do not pursue the development and potential commercialization of elobixibat for the treatment of CIC in the United States or Europe, whether through a licensing, collaboration or similar arrangement or otherwise, the revenue that we will generate based on elobixibat may be lower.\nIn addition to our agreement with EA Pharma for elobixibat in Japan and other select markets in Asia, we are currently evaluating whether we will seek a license or other partnering transaction with a third party for elobixibat in the United States or Europe. The cost and duration of the additional clinical trial or trials that will be required by the FDA and EMA to support marketing approval of elobixibat to treat CIC is currently uncertain, and the FDA has indicated to us that it may require in particular placebo controlled safety data for elobixibat. Even if we were to seek to establish licensing, collaboration or similar arrangement with a third party for the United States or Europe, the uncertain regulatory requirements may interfere with our ability to do so on acceptable terms, or at all. We do not currently anticipate that we will conduct future clinical trials of elobixibat for the United States or Europe independently, whether or not we elect to seek a suitable third-party arrangement. If we do not enter into suitable third-party arrangements and do not ourselves conduct clinical trials of elobixibat for the United States or Europe, the revenue that we will generate based on elobixibat will be limited to payments that we receive under our agreement with EA Pharma, which will reduce the overall commercial potential of elobixibat and may harm our business.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such clinical trials.\nWe do not independently conduct clinical trials for our product candidates. We rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and government agencies, to perform this function. Any of these third parties may terminate their engagements with us at any time. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, it would delay our product development activities.\nOur reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the clinical trial. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities require us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity of data and confidentiality of clinical trial participants are protected. We are also required to register clinical trials subject to FDA regulation and, with some exceptions, post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, www.ClinicalTrials.gov, within certain timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions. The National Institutes of Health also has announced plans to require sponsors to post results of clinical trials for unapproved products, including unfavorable results in clinical trials for unapproved uses of approved products.\nFurthermore, third parties that we rely on for our clinical development activities may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates. Our product development costs will increase if we experience delays in testing or obtaining marketing approvals.\nWe also rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nUse of third parties to manufacture our product candidates may increase the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or products or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial supplies of our product candidates. We have limited personnel with experience in drug manufacturing and lack the resources and the capabilities to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. We currently rely on third parties for supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API, in our product candidates. Our strategy is to outsource all manufacturing of our product candidates and products to third parties.\nWe do not currently have any agreements with third-party manufacturers for the long-term clinical or commercial supply of any of our product candidates. We currently engage a single third-party manufacturer to provide API for A4250 and elobixibat. We also currently engage single third-party manufacturers to provide fill and finish services for the final drug product formulation of A4250 that is being used in our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial and, in the case of elobixibat, clinical trials conducted by our licensee. We may in the future be unable to conclude agreements for commercial supply with third-party manufacturers on acceptable terms, or at all.\nEven if we are able to establish and maintain arrangements with third-party manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including:\n\u2022\nreliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u2022\nthe possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party;\n\u2022\nthe possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how; and\n\u2022\nthe possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.\nThird-party manufacturers may encounter difficulties in achieving volume production, laboratory testing, quality control or quality assurance or suffer shortages of qualified personnel, any of which could result in our inability to manufacture sufficient quantities to meet clinical timelines for a particular product candidate, to obtain marketing approval for the product candidate or to commercialize the product candidate. In addition, third-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with current good manufacturing practice, or GMP, regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our product candidates.\nOur product candidates and any products that we may develop may compete with other product candidates and products for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for us.\nIf the third parties that we engage to manufacture product for our preclinical tests and clinical trials cease to continue to do so for any reason, we likely would experience delays in advancing these clinical trials while we identify and qualify replacement suppliers and we may be unable to obtain replacement supplies on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, if we are not able to obtain adequate supplies of our product candidates or the drug substances used to manufacture them, it will be more difficult for us to develop our product candidates and compete effectively.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to develop product candidates and commercialize any products that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nWe may depend on additional collaborations, licenses or similar arrangements with third parties for the development and commercialization of some of our product candidates. If those collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these product candidates.\nWe have licensed rights to develop and commercialize elobixibat for CIC and other gastrointestinal diseases and disorders to EA Pharma in Japan and other select markets in Asia. We may in the future enter into other licensing, collaboration or similar arrangements for the development and commercialization of A4250, elobixibat, A3384 or any potential future product candidate of ours for any or all indications and for any or all territories. For example, we may elect to seek a licensing, collaboration or similar arrangement with one or more third parties for Phase 3 development and potential commercialization of elobixibat in the United States and Europe.\nOur likely counterparties for any licensing, collaboration or similar arrangement include large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies. Except for our agreement with EA Pharma, we are not currently party to any such arrangement for A4250, elobixibat or A3384. However, if we do enter into any such arrangements with any third parties in the future, we will likely have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of the applicable product candidate. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators\u2019 abilities and efforts to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.\nAny licensing, collaboration or similar arrangement involving our product candidates would pose numerous risks to us, including the following:\n\u2022\ncollaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations and may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may deemphasize or not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators\u2019 strategic focus, including as a result of a sale or disposition of a business unit or development function, or available funding, or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u2022\na collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to multiple products may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of our product relative to other products;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n\u2022\ndisputes may arise between us and a collaborator as to the ownership of intellectual property arising during the collaboration;\n\u2022\nwe may grant exclusive rights to our collaborators, which would prevent us from collaborating with others;\n\u2022\ndisputes may arise between us and a collaborator that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our products or product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources; and\n\u2022\ncollaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need to identify and enter into a new licensing, collaboration or similar arrangement or obtain additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates.\nFor example, in March 2015, Ferring terminated a 2012 license agreement with us for the development and commercialization of elobixibat worldwide, excluding the territory licensed to EA Pharma. Ferring\u2019s termination of the license agreement followed its stopping early two Phase 3 clinical trials of elobixibat that Ferring had been conducting due to an issue related to the distribution of study drug to study sites that was unrelated to the performance of elobixibat. As a result, to exploit the potential of elobixibat in the United States, Europe and otherwise outside of EA Pharma\u2019s licensed territory, we would need to either identify and enter into additional licensing, collaboration or similar arrangements or expend our own resources to conduct further development of elobixibat. We are currently evaluating whether we will seek to identify and enter into a license or other partnering transaction with a third party for elobixibat in the United States or Europe. Whether or not we elect to seek such a transaction, we do not currently anticipate that we will conduct future clinical trials of elobixibat independently.\nCollaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all. If a collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development or commercialization program could be delayed, diminished or terminated.\nIf we are not able to establish additional collaborations, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans.\nOur product development programs and the potential commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. For some of our product candidates, we may decide to collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of those product candidates.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by regulatory authorities, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions generally. The collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate. We may also be restricted under future license agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms with potential collaborators. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators.\nWe may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay our development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay our potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. For example, any Phase 3 program of elobixibat in the United States or Europe will depend on whether we elect to seek, and successfully enter into, a licensing, collaboration or similar arrangement under which that Phase 3 program would be conducted. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market and generate product revenue.\nThe terms of our loan facility agreement and the associated security agreements may restrict our ability to engage in certain transactions and adversely affect our operating flexibility.\nIn December 2014, we entered into a loan facility agreement with Kreos Capital IV (UK) Limited, or Kreos, which was revised in February 2016 and further amended and restated pursuant to a supplemental deed entered into in May 2016. We have also entered into certain guaranties and security agreements with Kreos. Pursuant to the terms of the loan facility agreement and the associated\nsecurity agreements, subject to certain exceptions, we cannot engage in specified transactions unless certain conditions are met or we receive the prior approval of Kreos. These transactions include:\n\u2022\ndisposing of our business or certain assets;\n\u2022\nentering into licensing arrangements regarding our intellectual property, other than on an arms\u2019 length basis in the ordinary course of business where the proceeds of an arrangement are used for our business;\n\u2022\ncertain changes to our business or ownership;\n\u2022\nincurring additional debt or liens or making payments on other debt;\n\u2022\nmaking certain investments and declaring dividends;\n\u2022\nbeing acquired by or merging with another entity;\n\u2022\nengaging in some transactions with affiliates; or\n\u2022\nencumbering intellectual property.\nIf Kreos does not provide its consent to such actions, we could be prohibited from engaging in transactions that could be beneficial to our business and our stockholders unless we repay the loan, which may not be desirable or possible. The obligations under the loan facility agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets. If we default under the loan facility agreement or the associated security agreements, including for an inability to repay amounts as they become due, and we are unable to obtain a waiver for such a default, Kreos would have a right to accelerate our obligation to repay the entire loan, obtain control of our cash accounts and foreclose on the secured assets in order to satisfy our obligations under the loan facility agreement. Any such action on the part of Kreos against us could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States, in Europe and in certain additional jurisdictions related to our novel technologies and product candidates that are important to our business. This process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, if we license technology or product candidates from third parties in the future, these license agreements may not permit us to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain or enforce the patents, covering the licensed technology or product candidates. These agreements could also give our licensors the right to enforce the licensed patents without our involvement, or to decide not to enforce the patents at all. Therefore, in these circumstances, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted or enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents, narrow the scope of our patent protection or make enforcement more difficult or uncertain.\nThe laws of other countries may not protect our patent rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than U.S. law does. For this or other reasons, we may not pursue or obtain patent protection in all major markets or may not obtain protection that enables us to prevent the entry of third parties onto the market.\nAssuming the other requirements for patentability are met, currently, the first to file a patent application is generally entitled to the patent. However, prior to March 16, 2013, in the United States, the first to invent was entitled to the patent. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with\ncertainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our U.S. patents or pending U.S. patent applications filed prior to March 16, 2013.\nMoreover, we may be subject to a third party preissuance submission of prior art to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, reissue, inter partes review, post grant review, interference proceedings or other patent office proceedings, court litigation or International Trade Commission proceedings, in the United States or elsewhere, challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation concerning our patent rights could reduce the scope of or prevent the enforceability of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allowing third parties to commercialize our technology or products, or equivalent or similar technology or products, and so to compete directly with us, without payment to us, or, where such proceedings involve third-party patents, result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened or narrowed by operation of any of the foregoing, such an event could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or potential future product candidates of ours.\nEven if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with adequate protection to prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise to provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar, improved or alternative technologies or products in a noninfringing manner. For example, although A3384 is the subject matter of pending patent applications that claim pharmaceutical formulations, patent protection is not available for composition-of-matter claims that only recite the API for A3384 without limitation to its formulation. Because A3384 lacks composition-of-matter protection for its API, competitors will, subject to obtaining marketing approval, be able to offer and sell products with the same API so long as these competitors do not infringe any of our issued patents. Moreover, method-of-treatment patent claims are more difficult to enforce than composition-of-matter claims for reasons including off-label sale, potential divided infringement issues and use of the subject compound in noninfringing manners. Physicians are permitted to prescribe an approved product for uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling. Although off-label prescriptions may infringe our method-of-treatment patents, the practice is common across medical specialties and such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute. Off-label sales would limit our ability to generate revenue from the sale of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale. In addition, if a third party were able to design around our dosage-form and formulation patents and create a different formulation and dosage form that is not covered by our patents or patent applications, we would likely be unable to prevent that third party from manufacturing and marketing our product.\nIn addition, other companies may attempt to circumvent any regulatory data protection or market exclusivity that we obtain under applicable legislation, such as orphan drug exclusivity in the United States, which may require us to allocate significant resources to preventing such circumvention. Legal and regulatory developments in the European Union and elsewhere may also result in clinical trial data submitted as part of a marketing authorization application becoming publicly available. Such developments could enable other companies to use our clinical trial data to assist in their own product development and to obtain marketing authorizations in the European Union and in other jurisdictions. Such developments may also require us to allocate significant resources to prevent other companies from circumventing or violating our intellectual property rights. Our attempts to prevent third parties from circumventing our intellectual property and other rights may ultimately be unsuccessful. We may also fail to take the required actions or pay the necessary fees to maintain our patents.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Future changes in U.S. statutory or case law beyond our control could affect some or all of the foregoing possibilities. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. This could be the case even after giving effect to patent term extensions and data exclusivity provisions preventing third parties from relying on clinical trial data filed by us for marketing approval in support of their own applications for such approval. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nIn addition, we have pledged certain of our patent rights related to A4250 and elobixibat as collateral under our loan agreement with Kreos.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits or other enforcement proceedings to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and potentially unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. Any claims we assert against\nperceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their intellectual property or that our patent and other intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable, including for antitrust reasons. As a result, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court or administrative body may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or may construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly and so refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the competitor technology in question. Even if we are successful in a patent infringement action, the unsuccessful party may subsequently raise antitrust issues and bring a follow-on action. Antitrust issues may also provide a bar to settlement or constrain the permissible settlement terms. Further, settlement agreements in the pharmaceutical sector are the subject of ongoing review by the antitrust authorities in the European Union.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our current or potential future licensees or collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the intellectual property and other proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and we may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology, including interference, derivation, inter partes review, reexamination, reissue or post-grant review proceedings before the USPTO. The risks of being involved in such litigation and office proceedings may also increase as our product candidates approach commercialization, and as our business gains greater visibility operating as a publicly traded company in the United States. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing or future intellectual property rights and so restrict our freedom to operate. Third parties may also seek injunctive relief against us, whereby they would attempt to prevent us from practicing our technologies altogether pending outcome of any litigation against us. We may not be aware of all such intellectual property rights potentially relating to our product candidates prior to their assertion against us. For example, we have not conducted an in depth freedom-to-operate search or analysis for A4250 or for A3384. Any freedom-to-operate search or analysis previously conducted may not have uncovered all relevant patents and pending patent applications, and there may be pending or future patent applications that, if issued, would block us from commercializing A4250, elobixibat or A3384. Thus, we do not know with certainty whether A4250, elobixibat, A3384 or any other product candidate, or our commercialization of any such product candidate, does not and will not infringe any third party\u2019s intellectual property.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, or in order to avoid or settle litigation, we could be required to obtain a license to enable us to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be nonexclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies that we have then licensed, and could require us to make substantial payments. Absent a license, we could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent or other intellectual property right. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties, or claims that we derived inventions from another, could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that we or our employees have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary or otherwise confidential information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have without authorization used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary or confidential information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\nIn addition, while we typically require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us and agreeing to cooperate and assist us with securing and defending our intellectual property, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. These assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nIf we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and could distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development, sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Accordingly, costs and lost management time, as well as uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIf we do not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act and similar legislation outside of the United States by extending the patent terms and obtaining data exclusivity for our product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of A4250, elobixibat, A3384 or potential future product candidates of ours, if any, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term restoration under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, we may not be granted an extension if, for example, we fail to apply within applicable deadlines, we fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or if we otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we will have the right to exclusively market our products will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration, and our revenue could be reduced, possibly materially. In the event that we are unable to obtain any patent term extension, the issued U.S. composition of matter patent for A4250 is expected to expire in 2022 assuming it withstands any challenge. In the event that we are unable to obtain any patent term extension, the issued U.S. composition of matter patent for elobixibat is expected to expire in 2022 and the issued U.S. patent for a method of using an IBAT inhibitor to treat CIC or IBS is expected to expire in 2024, in each case assuming it withstands any challenge. We expect that the other U.S. patents and patent applications for A4250 and elobixibat, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, would expire from 2031 to 2035. We also expect that our patent applications for A3384, which to date have been filed as priority applications in Sweden, if ultimately issued in the United States and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, would expire in 2037.\nA3384 could be subject to competition arising from off-label use from immediate release cholestyramine.\nWe have pending patent applications, currently filed as priority applications in Sweden, covering pharmaceutical formulations of A3384. Even if these patents ultimately issue in the United States or elsewhere, we do not have patent rights covering the composition of matter of cholestyramine. As a result, we may be limited in our ability to prevent others from exploiting cholestyramine, which could have a negative impact on the commercial potential of A3384. In addition, cholestyramine is currently approved in the United States and some countries in Europe for various indications, including in some countries in Europe for diarrhea associated with certain GI conditions. Physicians currently prescribe cholestyramine for other indications that are not approved by the FDA or regulatory authorities outside of the United States, such as BAM. If we are unable to establish that A3384 is a superior drug to immediate release cholestyramine in the treatment of BAM, physicians may be likely to continue to prescribe immediate release cholestyramine and our potential future revenue from sales of A3384 would likely be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and products, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary and confidential information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. However, we cannot guarantee that we have executed these agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets or that the agreements we have executed will provide adequate protection. Any party with whom we have executed such an agreement may breach that agreement and disclose our proprietary or confidential information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully\nobtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate the trade secret, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets, particularly unpatented know-how, were to be obtained or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval and Marketing of Our Product Candidates\nA rare pediatric disease designation may not lead to the receipt of a Priority Review Voucher, even if A4250 is approved.\nThe FDA has awarded rare pediatric disease Priority Review Vouchers to sponsors of drug products intended to treat rare pediatric disease products if the treatment and product application meet certain criteria. Under this program, upon the approval of a qualifying NDA or biologics license application, BLA, for the treatment or prevention of a rare pediatric disease, the sponsor of the application may be eligible for a rare pediatric disease Priority Review Voucher that can be used to obtain priority review for a subsequent NDA or BLA. The Priority Review Voucher may be sold or transferred an unlimited number of times. We anticipate that we will request rare pediatric disease designation for A4250 for PFIC. For purposes of this program, the FDA defines a \u201crare pediatric disease\u201d as a disease that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and more than 50% of those patients are under the age of 18 years old. There can be no assurance, however, that the FDA will agree with our position that A4250 for the treatment of PFIC meets the criteria for a \u201crare pediatric disease.\u201d If we submit a voluntary request for a rare pediatric disease designation and the request is granted by FDA, the FDA\u2019s rare pediatric disease designation would give us the potential to receive a Priority Review Voucher if A4250 is approved for marketing. The rare pediatric disease Priority Review Voucher program is now set to expire at the end of September 2020, although a drug that has been designated under the program as of September 30, 2020 may still receive the Priority Review Voucher if it is approved for marketing before October 1, 2022. Therefore, given this timing deadline for final product approval, there is no guarantee that we will receive a Priority Review Voucher for A4250 even if it is approved by the FDA to treat a rare pediatric disease.\nBecause A4250 and elobixibat share a common mechanism of action, if both product candidates are ultimately approved and commercialized, there is a risk that physicians will elect to prescribe one of these products at the expense of the other.\nWe are developing A4250 initially for the treatment of PFIC and potentially also for other pediatric cholestatic liver diseases and disorders and we may elect to seek a licensing, collaboration or similar arrangement with one or more third parties for Phase 3 development and potential future commercialization of elobixibat as a treatment for CIC in the United States and Europe. Both A4250 and elobixibat act by modulating bile acid levels in the body through IBAT inhibition. If both of these product candidates are approved and become available for commercial sale, physicians may decide to prescribe the lower-cost product off label for the treatment of conditions and disorders in which the modulation of bile acid levels may be medically useful, notwithstanding the specific indication for which we will have conducted clinical trials and obtained regulatory approval for that product. If this were to occur, there would be an adverse effect on our revenues, which could be material.\nEven if we complete the necessary clinical trials, the marketing approval process is expensive, time consuming and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our product candidates. If we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required marketing approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nOur product candidates, including A4250, elobixibat and A3384, and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and by comparable authorities in other countries. Failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. We have not received approval to market A4250, elobixibat, A3384 or any other product candidate from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction.\nWe have only limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to obtain marketing approvals for product candidates and expect to rely on third-party contract research organizations to assist us in this process. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and effectiveness. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities may determine that A4250, elobixibat, A3384 or any potential future product candidate of ours is not effective, is only moderately effective or has undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities, safety profiles or other characteristics that preclude us from obtaining marketing approval or that prevent or limit commercial use.\nThe process of obtaining marketing approvals is expensive, may take many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Changes\nin marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical studies, clinical trials or other trials. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable. If we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired.\nOur failure to obtain marketing approval in jurisdictions other than the United States and Europe would prevent our product candidates from being marketed in these other jurisdictions, and EA Pharma\u2019s failure to obtain marketing approval of elobixibat in Japan would prevent elobixibat from being marketed in Japan. Any approval that we are granted for our product candidates in the United States or Europe would not assure approval of product candidates in the other or in any other jurisdiction.\nIn order to market and sell A4250, elobixibat, A3384 or any potential future product candidate of ours in jurisdictions other than the United States or Europe, we or a current or potential future licensee or collaborator must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA or EMA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States and Europe generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA and EMA approval. In addition, some countries outside the United States and Europe require approval of the sales price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, separate procedures must be followed to obtain reimbursement. We or a current or potential future licensee or collaborator may not obtain marketing, pricing or reimbursement approvals outside the United States and Europe on a timely basis, if at all. In particular, EA Pharma may not obtain marketing, pricing or reimbursement approvals for elobixibat in Japan on a timely basis, if at all.\nApproval by the FDA does not ensure approval by the EMA, approval by the EMA does not assure approval by the FDA, and approval of either or both of the FDA and EMA does not assure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions. Likewise, approval by any regulatory authority in any country or jurisdiction outside the United States or Europe, such as Japan, does not assure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA or EMA. We and any current or potential future licensee or collaborator may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our product candidates in any market. Marketing approvals in countries outside the United States and Europe do not ensure pricing approvals in those countries or in any other countries, and marketing approvals and pricing approvals do not ensure that reimbursement will be obtained.\nOur ability to obtain and maintain conditional marketing authorizations in the European Union is limited to specific circumstances and subject to several conditions and obligations. A failure to renew any conditional approval that we obtain prior to full approval for the applicable indication would prevent us from continuing to market our products.\nConditional marketing authorizations in the European Union based on incomplete clinical data may be granted for a limited number of listed medicinal products for human use, including products designated as orphan medicinal products under E.U. law, if (1) the risk-benefit balance of the product is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (3) unmet medical needs will be fulfilled and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. Specific obligations, including with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies or trials, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data, may be specified in the conditional marketing authorization. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions. Even if we obtain conditional approval for A4250 for the treatment of PFIC or any other pediatric cholestatic liver disease or disorder, we may not be able to renew such conditional approval.\nEven if we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates, the terms of approvals and ongoing regulation of our products may limit how we manufacture or market our products and compliance with such requirements may involve substantial resources, which could materially impair our ability to generate profit.\nEven if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, an approved product and its manufacturer and marketer are subject to ongoing review and extensive regulation, including the possible requirement to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy or to conduct costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. We must also comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions\nand must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved labeling. Thus, we will not be able to promote any products we develop for indications or uses for which they are not approved. In addition, manufacturers of approved products and those manufacturers\u2019 facilities are required to ensure that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP, which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and reporting requirements. We and our contract manufacturers could be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA to monitor and ensure compliance with cGMP.\nAccordingly, assuming we receive marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates, we and our contract manufacturers will continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, product surveillance and quality control. If we are not able to comply with post-approval regulatory requirements, we could have marketing approval for any of our products withdrawn by regulatory authorities and our ability to market any future products could be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve or sustain profitability. Thus, the cost of compliance with post-approval regulations may have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval will be subject to strict enforcement of post-marketing requirements and we could be subject to substantial penalties, including withdrawal of our products from the market, if we fail to comply with all regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, when and if any of them are approved.\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include, but are not limited to, restrictions governing promotion of an approved product, submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, and requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping.\nThe FDA and other federal and state agencies, including the Department of Justice and state attorneys general, closely regulate compliance with all requirements governing prescription drug products, including requirements pertaining to marketing and promotion of drugs in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling and manufacturing of products in accordance with cGMP requirements. Violations of such requirements may lead to investigations alleging violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other statutes, including the False Claims Act and other federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws as well as state consumer protection laws. Our failure to comply with all regulatory requirements, and later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, may yield various results, including:\n\u2022\nlitigation involving patients taking our products;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on product distribution or use;\n\u2022\nrequirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwarning or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u2022\nrecall of products;\n\u2022\nfines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u2022\ndamage to relationships with any potential collaborators;\n\u2022\nunfavorable press coverage and damage to our reputation;\n\u2022\nrefusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure; or\n\u2022\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nOur noncompliance, or noncompliance by any future licensee or collaborator, with regulatory requirements relating to safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, to the development of products for the pediatric population or to the protection of personal information can lead to significant penalties and sanctions.\nWe may not be able to obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for our product candidates. If Shire is able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for SHP625, or any of our other competitors is able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for any of its products that is the same drug as one of our product candidates, or can be classified as a similar medicinal product within the meaning of E.U. law, we may not be able to have competing products approved by the applicable regulatory authority for a significant period of time.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including Europe and the United States, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to A4250, which is an IBAT inhibitor, for the treatment of PFIC, as well as PBC, and the EMA has designated A4250 as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of PFIC, as well as PBC and ALGS. Generally, if a designated orphan drug product receives the first marketing approval for the orphan indication for which it has been designated, the product is entitled to a period of market exclusivity, which, subject to certain exceptions, precludes the EMA from accepting another marketing application for a similar medicinal product or the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for that period of exclusivity. The applicable market exclusivity period is seven years in the United States and 10 years in the European Union. The E.U. exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, including if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified.\nIn the European Union, a \u201csimilar medicinal product\u201d is a medicinal product that contains a similar active substance or substances as contained in a currently authorized orphan medicinal product and that is intended for the same therapeutic indication. For a product candidate such as A4250, the FDA defines \u201csame drug\u201d as a drug that contains the same active moiety, which refers to the molecule which is responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug, and is intended for the same use. Obtaining orphan drug exclusivity for A4250 for PFIC, both in the United States and in Europe, may be important to the product candidate\u2019s success. Shire\u2019s product candidate for the treatment of PFIC and other rare liver diseases, SHP625, which has been reported to be an IBAT inhibitor, has also received orphan drug designation from the FDA and EMA, and SHP625 has been evaluated to date in a greater number of PFIC patients than A4250. If Shire or any other competitor of ours obtains orphan drug exclusivity for, and approval of, a product for the same indication as A4250 before we do and if the competitor\u2019s product is the same drug or a similar medicinal product as ours, we could be excluded from the market until that exclusivity period expires.\nMoreover, we may not be able to maintain orphan drug exclusivity for A4250 for PFIC or any other indication, or for any other product candidate and indication for which we obtain orphan drug exclusivity in the future. For example, if a competitive product that is the same drug or a similar medicinal product as our product candidate is shown to be clinically superior to our product candidate, any orphan drug exclusivity that we have obtained will not block the approval of such competitive product. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity will not prevent the approval of a product that is the same drug as our product candidate if the FDA finds that we cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs of the persons with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Finally, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drug products can be approved for the same condition.\nFast track designation by the FDA may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.\nIf a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life threatening condition and the drug demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition, the drug sponsor may apply for FDA fast track designation. The designation offers the sponsor opportunities for interactions with the FDA review team and the possibility of a rolling review for certain portions of the marketing application. We believe that A4250 meets the criteria to be designated as a fast track product. However, even if we seek and are granted a fast track designation for A4250, there is no assurance that A4250 will receive marketing approval from the FDA or that approval will be granted within any particular timeframe. We may also seek fast track designation for other current or potential future product candidates of ours. Even if the FDA grants fast track designation to one or more of these product candidates, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. In addition, the FDA may withdraw fast track designation that may in the future be granted to any of our product candidates if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program for that product candidate. Fast track designation alone does not guarantee qualification for the FDA\u2019s priority review procedures.\nPriority review designation by the FDA may not lead to a faster regulatory review or approval process and, in any event, does not assure FDA approval.\nIf the FDA determines that a product candidate intended to treat a serious disease, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness of the treatment of the disease, the FDA may designate the drug application for that product candidate for priority review. A priority review designation means that the goal for the FDA to review the marketing application is six months, rather than the standard review period of ten months. We may request priority review for A4250 or other current or potential future product candidates of ours at the time that the marketing application is submitted. The FDA has broad discretion with respect to whether or not to grant priority review status to an individual marketing application. As a result, even if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for such designation or status, the FDA may decide not to grant it. Moreover, a priority review designation does not necessarily mean a faster regulatory review process or necessarily confer any advantage with respect to approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. Receiving a priority review designation from the FDA does not guarantee approval of the drug application within the six-month review cycle or any time thereafter.\nOur relationships with customers, healthcare providers and professionals and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidate, including A4250, elobixibat or A3384, for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with customers, healthcare providers and professionals, and third-party payors may expose us to broadly applicable federal and state fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell or distribute any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nThe federal anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. This statute has been broadly interpreted to apply to manufacturer arrangements with prescribers, purchasers and pharmacy benefit managers, among others. Several other countries, including the United Kingdom, have enacted similar anti-kickback laws and regulations.\nThe federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, and provides for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Both the government and qui tam relators have brought False Claims Act actions against pharmaceutical companies on the theory that their practices have caused false claims to be submitted to the government.\nThe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or for knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH Act, and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.\nThe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, referred to together as the Affordable Care Act, require manufacturers of FDA-approved drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies covered by Medicare or Medicaid to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value made to or at the request of covered recipients, such as physicians and teaching hospitals, and physician ownership and investment interests in such manufacturers. Among other payments, the law requires payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals for clinical trials be disclosed.\nAnalogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by nongovernmental third-party payors, including private insurers. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines, or the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures to the extent that those laws impose requirements that are more stringent than the Physician Payments Sunshine Act. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Violation of certain of these laws could also result in exclusion, suspension and debarment from government funded healthcare programs. Exclusion, suspension or debarment would significantly impact our ability to commercialize, sell or distribute any product candidate for which we obtain regulatory approval. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nLegislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain for any product that receives marketing approval.\nIn the United States and in some other jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of A4250, elobixibat, A3384 or any potential future product candidates of ours, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, or affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates, including A4250, elobixibat or A3384, for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nIn the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the Medicare Modernization Act, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products. While the Medicare Modernization Act applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the Medicare Modernization Act may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nIn March 2010, the Affordable Care Act became law in the United States. The Affordable Care Act is a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for health care and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Effective October 1, 2010, the Affordable Care Act revised the definition of \u201caverage manufacturer price\u201d for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states. Further, the law imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. Substantial provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may affect our business practices with health care practitioners. As implementation of the Affordable Care Act is ongoing, the law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. Similarly, there are a number of state and local legislative and regulatory efforts related to drug pricing, including a newly passed drug price transparency law in Vermont that applies to pharmaceutical manufacturers, that may have an impact on our business.\nIn addition, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We are unsure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the current regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or whether such changes will have any impact on our business.\nIn the European Union, similar political, economic and regulatory developments may affect our ability to profitably commercialize our products. In addition to continuing pressure on prices and cost containment measures, legislative developments at the European Union or E.U. member state level may result in significant additional requirements or obstacles that may increase our operating costs.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption laws, as well as export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures and legal expenses, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries where we do business and may do business in the future. The FCPA and these other laws generally prohibit us, our officers, and our employees and intermediaries from bribing, being bribed or making other prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. We may in the future operate in jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential FCPA violations and we may participate in collaborations and relationships with third parties whose actions could potentially subject us to liability under the FCPA or local anti-corruption laws. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nWe are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the government of the United States and authorities in the European Union, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions on countries and persons, customs requirements and currency exchange regulations, collectively referred to as the Trade Control laws.\nThere is no assurance that we will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA or other legal requirements, including Trade Control laws. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Likewise, any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws by U.S. or other authorities could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cyber security incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of third parties with which we contract are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. System failures, accidents or security breaches could cause interruptions in our operations, and could result in a material disruption of our clinical and commercialization activities and business operations, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. The loss of clinical trial data could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and our product research, development and commercialization efforts could be delayed.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations, Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nIn connection with the preparation of Albireo Limited\u2019s consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, Albireo Limited and its independent registered public accounting firm identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting. If we are not able to remediate the material weakness and otherwise to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, the reliability of our financial reporting, investor confidence in us and the value of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected.\nUnder standards established by the United States Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis.\nIn connection with the audits of Albireo Limited\u2019s 2014 and 2015 financial statements, which were completed concurrently with each other, Albireo Limited and its independent registered public accounting firm identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting, specifically a lack of controls over the identification and review of complex accounting issues involving significant judgment or estimates in the financial statement closing process resulting from Albireo Limited\u2019s limited in-house accounting and finance team. We currently rely on external advisors to provide assistance with financial reporting in accordance with the requirements of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and these external advisors may not have direct knowledge of all of our business, transactions and contracts. Specifically, Albireo Limited and its independent registered public accounting firm determined that Albireo\nLimited did not have sufficient resources with U.S. GAAP and SEC financial reporting knowledge to ensure a timely and sufficient financial statement close process that includes resolution of complex accounting issues involving significant judgment and estimates.\nWe are working to remediate the material weakness. In particular, we hired a full-time chief financial officer in July 2016 and we plan to hire a controller and to develop and implement formal policies, processes and documentation procedures relating to our financial reporting. However, we cannot at this time estimate how long it will take to remediate the material weakness and we may not ever be able to remediate the material weakness. If we are unable to successfully remediate the material weakness and otherwise to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, the reliability of our financial reporting, investor confidence in us and the value of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us, as and when required, conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, or any subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, as and when required, may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nPursuant to Section 404, we will be required to furnish a report by our management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and, if and at such time as we cease to qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under applicable securities regulations, an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed period, we will be engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that we will not be able to conclude within the prescribed timeframe that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404. This could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. In addition, because we currently qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under applicable securities regulations, an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting will not be required. An independent assessment of our internal control over financial reporting might detect deficiencies that management\u2019s assessment does not.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain our chief executive officer and other key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on Ronald H.W. Cooper, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and other principal members of our management and scientific teams. Although we have formal employment agreements with each of our executive officers, these agreements do not prevent our executives from terminating their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance on any of our executive officers. The unplanned loss of the services of any of these persons could materially impact the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel, including in the United States and Sweden, will also be critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.\nWe expect to expand our capabilities and, as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nWe expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of drug development, regulatory affairs, finance and administration and, potentially, sales and marketing. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources and the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with such anticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nWe incur significant costs and demands as a result of operating as a public company.\nWe incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses to meet our obligations as a publicly traded company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways that are not currently anticipated. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations may make it difficult and expensive for us to maintain director and officer liability insurance coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and could cause our business or stock price to suffer.\nWe are exposed to risks related to currency exchange rates.\nWe conduct a significant portion of our operations outside of the United States. Because our financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a significant effect on our operating results when our operating results are translated into U.S. dollars. Exchange rate fluctuations between local currencies and the dollar create risk in several ways, including the following: weakening of the dollar may increase the cost of overseas research and development expenses and the cost of sourced product components outside the United States; strengthening of the dollar may decrease the value of our revenues denominated in other currencies; the exchange rates on nondollar transactions and cash deposits can distort our financial results; and commercial pricing and profit margins may be affected.\nOur employees, principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading, which could cause significant liability for us and harm our reputation.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, principal investigators, consultants and collaborators, including intentional failures to comply with FDA or Office of Inspector General regulations or similar regulations of comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities, provide accurate information to the FDA or comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities, comply with manufacturing standards we have established, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. Misconduct by these parties could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws, standards or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nThe vote by the United Kingdom electorate in favor of the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe passage of the referendum on the United Kingdom\u2019s membership in the European Union, referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d in favor of the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union, could cause disruption to and create uncertainty surrounding our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations. Over the next few months, negotiations are\nexpected to commence to determine the terms of the United Kingdom\u2019s relationship with the European Union in the future, including trade terms between the United Kingdom and countries comprising the European Union. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the United Kingdom makes to retain access to markets in the European Union, either during a transitional period or more permanently.\nAssuming its implementation, Brexit would result in the United Kingdom no longer being a European Union Member State and a member of the European Union single market, which may result in increased trade barriers. Increased trade barriers could impact our results of operations. As we have a subsidiary registered in England and Wales and operating subsidiaries in Sweden, Brexit could result in restrictions on the movement of capital within our organization, the mobility of our personnel and the potential future commercialization of our product candidates and could change our tax benefits or liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price is expected to be volatile, and the market price of our common stock may drop.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations. Market prices for securities of development-stage pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences companies have historically been particularly volatile. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates, and delays or failures to obtain such approvals;\n\u2022\nfailure of any of our product candidates, if approved, to achieve commercial success;\n\u2022\nissues in manufacturing our approved products, if any, or product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe results of our current and any future clinical trials of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe entry into, or termination of, key agreements, including key commercial partner agreements;\n\u2022\nthe initiation of, material developments in, or conclusion of litigation to enforce or defend any of our intellectual property rights or defend against the intellectual property rights of others;\n\u2022\nannouncements by commercial partners or competitors of new commercial products, clinical progress or the lack thereof, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity relating to the markets in which we compete, including with respect to other products and potential products in such markets;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of technological innovations or new therapies that compete with our product candidates or products;\n\u2022\nthe loss of key employees;\n\u2022\nchanges in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if any, who cover our common stock;\n\u2022\ngeneral and industry-specific economic conditions that may affect our research and development expenditures;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of health care payment systems;\n\u2022\nfailure to maintain compliance with listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market; and\n\u2022\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.\nMoreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation.\nOur stock price may be especially volatile because of, and investor interest in our common stock may be negatively affected by, unauthorized trading of our common stock on stock exchanges in Germany.\nWe are aware that our common stock may be trading on multiple stock exchanges in Germany, which we have not authorized. These German exchanges have been rumored to allow short selling of stock without assurance that shares sufficient to cover the trade\nare available, also known as \u201cnaked\u201d short selling, or otherwise not comply with exchange requirements that are customary in the United States. The trading of our common stock on these German stock exchanges may make the market price of our common stock more volatile than it would otherwise be. This increased volatility, or the potential for this increased volatility, could have a negative impact on investor interest in our common stock, which could depress the market price of our common stock.\nOur executive officers and directors and their affiliates have the ability to control or significantly influence all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval.\nAs of December 20, 2016, our executive officers and directors, and their affiliates, beneficially own or control approximately 51.1% of our outstanding shares of common stock (after giving effect to the exercise of all outstanding vested and unvested options to purchase shares of our common stock). Accordingly, these executive officers, directors and their affiliates, acting as a group, will have substantial influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or any other significant corporate transactions. These stockholders may also delay or prevent a change of control of us, even if such a change of control would benefit our other stockholders. The significant concentration of stock ownership may cause the price of our common stock to decline if investors perceive that conflicts of interest may exist or arise.\nWe are a smaller reporting company. We cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors or otherwise limit our ability to raise additional funds.\nWe are currently a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under applicable securities regulations. A smaller reporting company is a company that has an aggregate market value of the company\u2019s voting stock held by non-affiliates, or public float, of less than $75 million as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter and does not meet certain exceptions. SEC rules provide that smaller reporting companies may only sell shares under a Form S-3 shelf registration statement, during any 12-month period, in an amount less than or equal to one-third of the public float. If we do not meet this public float requirement, any offering by us under a Form S-3 will be limited to raising an aggregate of one-third of our public float in any 12-month period. You should also refer to the risk factor above entitled \u201cLimitations on the ability of smaller reporting companies to sell shares under a Form S-3 shelf registration statement may interfere with our ability to execute financing transactions quickly or at all.\u201d In addition, a smaller reporting company is able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in its filings, is exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that an independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, and has certain other reduced disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports. Reduced disclosure in our SEC filings due to our status as a smaller reporting company may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects.\nWe do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe currently expect to retain our future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, we are prohibited from making any dividend payments under the terms of our loan facility. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain, if any, for the foreseeable future.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market after applicable lock-up and other legal restrictions on resale discussed in this proxy statement lapse, the trading price of our common stock could decline. As of December 20, 2016, we had outstanding a total of approximately 6.3 million shares of common stock. Of these shares, only approximately 2.1 million shares of common stock are freely tradable, without restriction, in the public market as of December 20, 2016.\nThe lock-up agreements entered into by the former directors and officers of Biodel and the lock-up restrictions in the Exchange Agreement provide that the shares subject to the lock-up restrictions will be released from such restrictions 180 days from November 3, 2016, the closing date of the share exchange. In addition, the shares of our common stock that were issued in the share exchange are restricted securities under the Securities Act and any sale of such shares without registration will be subject to the requirements of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act. Based on shares outstanding as of December 20, 2016, up to an additional approximately 4.2 million shares of common stock will be eligible for sale in the public market, approximately 3.0 million of which are held by our directors, our executive officers and other affiliates and are subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, and various vesting agreements. In addition, approximately 690,455 shares of common stock that are subject to outstanding stock options as of December 20, 2016 will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the\nprovisions of various vesting agreements and the lock-up agreements and to the extent the shares are registered for sale under the Securities Act or permitted for sale in the public market by Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities Act. If these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nBecause the share exchange completed pursuant to the Exchange Agreement resulted in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the pre-exchange net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes of Biodel will be subject to limitations. Our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may also be subject to additional limitations as a result of ownership changes.\nIf a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or Section 382, the corporation\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes arising from before the ownership change are subject to limitations on use after the ownership change. In general, an ownership change occurs if there is a cumulative change in the corporation\u2019s equity ownership by certain stockholders that exceeds fifty percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. The share exchange resulted in an ownership change for Biodel and, accordingly, the ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes of Biodel will be limited. Our net operating loss carryforwards may also be subject to limitation as a result of shifts in equity ownership or the completed share exchange. Additional ownership changes in the future could result in additional limitations on our net operating loss carryforwards. Consequently, even if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of these net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and results of operations.\nWe may become involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management\u2019s attention and harm our business and insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all costs and damages.\nIn the past, securities class action or shareholder derivative litigation often follows certain significant business transactions, such as the sale of a business division or announcement of a merger. We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation often is expensive and diverts management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team.\nAmong others, these provisions:\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board are elected at one time;\n\u2022\nallow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nlimit the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from the board of directors;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our board of directors;\n\u2022\nrequire that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u2022\nlimit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a stockholder rights plan or \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all of our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal certain provisions of our charter or bylaws.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.", "PERMNO": 92032, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ALBO"}
