{"cik": "1668370", "company": "Toughbuilt Industries, Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-04-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business is subject to many risks and uncertainties, which may affect our future financial performance. If any of the events or circumstances described below occur, our business and financial performance could be adversely affected, our actual results could differ materially from our expectations, and the price of our stock could decline. The risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face. There may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material that may adversely affect our business and financial performance. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all other information included in this report including our financial statements and related notes, before making an investment decision. The statements contained in this report that are not historic facts are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by forward-looking statements. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and investors in our securities may lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nGoing Concern\nThe Company has incurred substantial operating losses since its inception. As reflected in the consolidated financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $98.3 million at December 31, 2021, a net loss of approximately $37.5 million, and approximately $66.1 million of net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021. The accompanying consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company anticipates incurring additional losses until such time, if ever, that it can obtain marketing approval to sell, and then generate significant sales, of its technology that is currently in development. As such we believe that additional financing will be needed by the Company to fund its operations and to develop and commercialize its technology. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. For the next twelve months from issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company will seek to obtain additional capital through the sale of debt or equity financings or other arrangements to fund operations; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise needed capital under acceptable terms, if at all. The sale of additional equity may dilute existing stockholders and newly issued shares may contain senior rights and preferences compared to currently outstanding shares of common stock. Issued debt securities may contain covenants and limit the Company's ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to stockholders. If the Company is unable to obtain such additional financing, future operations would need to be scaled back or discontinued. Due to the uncertainty in the Company's ability to raise capital, management believes that there is substantial doubt in the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the issuance of these consolidated financial statements.\nWe will require additional capital in order to achieve commercial success and\n, if necessary\n, to finance future losses from operations as we endeavor to build revenue\n, but we do not have any commitments to obtain such capital and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain adequate capital as and when required\n.\nWe may not be able to generate any profit in the foreseeable future. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we have a net loss of $37,525,898, compared to a net loss of $17,348,622 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we will realize profits in fiscal 2022 or thereafter. If we fail to generate profits from our operations, we will not be able to sustain our business. We may never report profitable operations or generate sufficient revenue to maintain our Company as a going concern. We continue to control our cash expenses as a percentage of expected revenue on an annual basis and thus may use our cash balances in the short term to invest in revenue growth; however, we cannot give assurance that we can increase our cash balances or limit our cash consumption and thus maintain sufficient cash balances for our planned operations. Future business demands may lead to cash utilization at levels greater than recently experienced. We may need to raise additional capital in the future. However, we cannot assure that we will be able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all. Our inability to generate profits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; Liquidity and Capital Resources\n.\u201d\nWe do not have a significant operating history and\n, as a result\n, there is a limited amount of information about us on which to make an investment decision\n.\nOur Company was incorporated and commenced operations in April 2012. Accordingly, we have only a limited operating history upon which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects. Operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and we cannot assure you that we will achieve or sustain profitability. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks encountered by companies in the relatively early stage of development, particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets. Future operating results will depend upon many factors, including increasing the number of affiliates, our success in attracting and retaining motivated and qualified personnel, our ability to establish short-term credit lines, our ability to develop and market new products, control costs, and general economic conditions. We cannot assure you that we will successfully address any of these risks.\nWe have limited management and staff and will be dependent upon partnering arrangements\n.\nAs of April 14, 2022, we have a total 20 independent contractors and consultants. Our dependence on third-party consultants and service providers creates a number of risks, including but not limited to, the possibility that such third parties may not be available to us as and when needed, and that we may not be able to properly control the timing and quality of work conducted with respect to our projects. If we experience significant delays in obtaining the services of such third parties or poor performance by such parties, our results of operations and stock price will be materially adversely affected.\nThe loss of any of our executive officers could adversely affect us\n.\nWe currently only have four executive officers. We are dependent on the extensive experience of our executive officers to implement our acquisition and growth strategy, specifically, Michael Panosian, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Joshua Keller, our Vice President of Research and Development. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers could have a negative impact on our operations and our ability to implement our strategy. Although we maintain a \u201ckey man\u201d life insurance policy only for Michael Panosian but none for any of our other employees, our key man policy for Mr. Panosian is for $1 million and will be insufficient to recover any losses resulting by Mr. Panosian\u2019s death while serving as our President and Chief Executive Officer.\nWe may be unable to attract necessary employees or be able to prevent our current employees from leaving our Company\n.\nTo induce valuable employees to remain at our Company, in addition to salary and cash incentives, we have provided restricted stock and stock options that vest over time. The value to employees of stock options that vest over time may be significantly affected by movements in our stock price that are beyond our control and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. Despite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management may terminate their employment with us. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly employees.\nIf the hosts of third-party marketplaces limit our access to such marketplaces\n, our operations and financial results will be adversely affected\n.\nThird-party marketplaces account for a significant portion of our revenues. Our sales through online third-party marketplaces represented a combined 18.5]% of total sales for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021. We anticipate that sales of our products on third-party marketplaces will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues. In the future, the loss of access to these third-party marketplaces, or any significant cost increases from operating on the marketplaces, could significantly reduce our revenues, and the success of our business depends partly on continued access to these third-party marketplaces. Our relationships with our third-party marketplace providers could deteriorate as a result of a variety of factors, such as if they become concerned about our ability to deliver quality products on a timely basis or to protect a third-party\u2019s intellectual property. In addition, third-party marketplace providers could prohibit our access to these marketplaces if we are not able to meet the applicable required terms of use. Loss of access to a marketplace channel could result in lower sales, and as a result, our business and financial results may suffer.\nWe are highly dependent upon manufacturers in China\n, India and the Philippines and an interruption in such relationships or our ability to obtain products from them could adversely affect our business and results of operations\n.\nOur products are manufactured by factories located in China, India, and the Philippines. Our ability to acquire products from our suppliers in amounts and on terms acceptable to us is dependent upon a number of factors which are unforeseeable and may be beyond our control. For example, financial or operational difficulties that some of our manufacturers may face could result in an increase in the cost of the products we purchase from them. If we do not maintain our relationships with our existing manufacturers or fail to find replacement or additional manufacturers in a timely manner and on acceptable commercial terms, we may not be able to continue to offer our products at competitive prices and any failure to deliver those products to our customers in a timely and accurate manner may damage our reputation and brand and could cause us to lose customers and our sales could decline.\nDisruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business\n.\nA disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs or damage to our reputation. Such disruptions may result from damage or destruction to our distribution centers, weather-related events, natural disasters, international trade disputes or trade policy changes or restrictions, tariffs or import-related taxes, third-party strikes, lock-outs, work stoppages or slowdowns, shortages of supply chain labor, shipping capacity, third-party contract disputes, supply or shipping interruptions or costs, military conflicts, acts of terrorism, public health issues, including pandemics or quarantines (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and related shut-downs, re-openings or other actions by the government, civil unrest or other factors beyond our control. In recent years, U.S. ports, particularly those located on the West coast, have been impacted by capacity constraints, port congestion and delays, periodic labor disputes, security issues, weather-related events and natural disasters, which have been further exacerbated by the pandemic. Disruptions to our supply chain due to any of the factors listed above could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition.\nIn addition, a significant percentage of the production, downstream processing and sales of our products occurs outside the United States or with vendors, suppliers or customers located outside the United States. If tariffs or other restrictions are placed by the United States on foreign imports from China, India or the Philippines or other countries, or any related counter-measures are taken, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects may be harmed. Tariffs may increase our cost of goods, which could result in lower gross margin on certain of our products. If we raise prices to account for any such increase in costs of goods, the competitiveness of the affected products could potentially be reduced. In either case, increased tariffs on imports from China, India or the Philippines or other countries could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Trade restrictions and sanctions implemented by the United States or other countries, including sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States and other countries due to Russia\u2019s recent invasion of Ukraine, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are highly dependent upon manufacturers in China\n, India and the Philippines\n, which exposes us to complex regulatory regimes and logistical challenges\n.\nWe acquire a majority of our products from manufacturers and distributors located in China, India and the Philippines. We do not have any long-term contracts or exclusive agreements with our foreign suppliers that would ensure our ability to acquire the types and quantities of products we desire at acceptable prices and in a timely manner or that would allow us to rely on customary indemnification protection with respect to any third-party claims similar to some of our U.S. suppliers. In addition, because many of our suppliers are outside of the United States, additional factors could interrupt our relationships or affect our ability to acquire the necessary products on acceptable terms, including:\n\u25cf political, social, and economic instability and the risk of war or other international incidents in Asia, India or the Philippines;\n\u25cf fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may increase our cost of products;\n\u25cf the imposition of duties, taxes, tariffs, or other charges on imports;\n\u25cf difficulties in complying with import and export laws, regulatory requirements, and restrictions;\n\u25cf natural disasters and public health emergencies, such as the recent outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus identified first in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and having turned into a global pandemic that has impacted a number of countries from which we purchase product;\n\u25cf import shipping delays resulting from foreign or domestic labor shortages, slow-downs, or stoppage;\n\u25cf the failure of local laws to provide a sufficient degree of protection against infringement of our intellectual property;\n\u25cf imposition of new legislation relating to import quotas or other restrictions that may limit the quantity of our product that may be imported into the U.S. from countries or regions where we do business;\n\u25cf financial or political instability in any of the countries in which our product is manufactured;\n\u25cf potential recalls or cancellations of orders for any product that does not meet our quality standards;\n\u25cf disruption of imports by labor disputes or strikes and local business practices;\n\u25cf political or military conflict involving the U.S. or any country in which our suppliers are located, which could cause a delay in the transportation of our products, an increase in transportation costs and additional risk to product being damaged and delivered on time;\n\u25cf heightened terrorism security concerns, which could subject imported goods to additional, more frequent or more thorough inspections, leading to delays in deliveries or impoundment of goods for extended periods;\n\u25cf inability of our non-U.S. suppliers to obtain adequate credit or access liquidity to finance their operations; and\n\u25cf our ability to enforce any agreements with our foreign suppliers.\nIf we were unable to import products from China, India and the Philippines or were unable to import products from such countries in a cost-effective manner, we could suffer irreparable harm to our business and be required to significantly curtail our operations, file for bankruptcy or cease operations.\nFrom time to time, we may also have to resort to administrative and court proceedings to enforce our legal rights with foreign suppliers. However, it may be more difficult to evaluate the level of legal protection we enjoy in China, India and the Philippines and the corresponding outcome of any administrative or court proceedings than in comparison to our suppliers in the United States.\nOur financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2022 may be adversely affected by the coronavirus outbreak\n.\nA significant outbreak, epidemic or pandemic of contagious diseases in any geographic area in which we operate or plan to operate could result in a health crisis adversely affecting the economies, financial markets and overall demand for our services in such areas. In addition, any preventative or protective actions that governments implement or that we take in response to a health crisis, such as travel restrictions, quarantines, or site closures, may interfere with the ability of our employees, suppliers and customers to perform their responsibilities. Such results could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe continued global COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. To date, this pandemic has affected nearly all regions around the world. In the United States, businesses as well as federal, state and local governments implemented significant actions to mitigate this public health crisis. While we cannot predict the duration or scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, it may negatively impact our business and such impact could be material to our financial results, condition and outlook related to:\n\u25cf reduction or volatility in demand for our products, which may be caused by, among other things: reduced online traffic and changes in consumer spending behaviors (e.g., consumer confidence in general macroeconomic conditions and a decrease in consumer spending);\n\u25cf disruption to our operations or the operations of our suppliers, through the effects of business and facilities closures, worker sickness and COVID-19 related inability to work, social, economic, political or labor instability in affected areas, transportation delays, travel restrictions and changes in operating procedures, including for additional cleaning and safety protocols;\n\u25cf impacts to our third-party marketplaces\u2019 ability to operate or manage increases in their operating costs and other supply chain effects that may have an adverse effect on our ability to meet consumer demand and achieve cost targets;\n\u25cf increased volatility or significant disruption of global financial markets due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic, which could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and other funding sources, on acceptable terms or at all and impede our ability to comply with debt covenants; and\n\u25cf The further spread of COVID-19, and the requirements to take action to mitigate the spread of the pandemic (e.g., vaccination requirements that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic and enhanced health and hygiene requirements or social distancing or other measures), will impact our ability to carry out our business as usual and may materially adversely impact global economic conditions, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar public health threat has an impact on our business, it is likely to also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\n\u201d section.\nThe increase of commodity prices such as fuel\n, plastic and metal could negatively impact our profit margins\n.\nPrices of certain commodity products, including raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, trade restrictions and tariffs. Increasing prices in the component materials for the parts of our goods may impact the availability, the quality and the price of our products, as suppliers search for alternatives to existing materials and increase the prices they charge. We cannot ensure that we can recover all the increased costs through price increases, and our suppliers may not continue to provide the consistent quality of product as they may substitute lower cost materials to maintain pricing levels, all of which may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. The Company\u2019s cost base also reflects significant elements for freight, including fuel. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices such as fuel, plastic and metal may negatively affect our profit margins.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations could be negatively impacted by inflationary or deflationary economic conditions which could affect the ability to obtain goods from our suppliers in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nThe Company\u2019s profitability may be negatively impacted if the Company is unable to mitigate any inflationary increases through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives. Conversely, in the event there is deflation, the Company may experience pressure from its customers to reduce prices, and there can be no assurance that the Company would be able to reduce its cost base (through negotiations with suppliers or other measures) to offset any such price concessions which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to manage the challenges associated with our international operations\n, the growth of our business could be limited and our business could suffer\n.\nWe maintain international business operations throughout Europe with a majority being in the United Kingdom. Our international operations include sales and back office support services for our European market. We are subject to a number of risks and challenges that specifically relate to our international operations. Our international operations may not be successful if we are unable to meet and overcome these challenges, which could limit the growth of our business and may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. These risks and challenges include:\n\u25cf difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations, including any impairment to our relationship with employees caused by a reduction in force;\n\u25cf restrictions imposed by local labor practices and laws on our business and operations;\n\u25cf exposure to different business practices and legal standards;\n\u25cf unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf the imposition of government controls and restrictions;\n\u25cf political, social and economic instability and the risk of war, terrorist activities or other international incidents;\n\u25cf the failure of telecommunications and connectivity infrastructure;\n\u25cf natural disasters and public health emergencies;\n\u25cf potentially adverse tax consequences; and\n\u25cf fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and relative weakness in the U.S. dollar.\nIf we fail to offer a broad selection of products at competitive prices or fail to maintain sufficient inventory to meet customer demands\n, our revenue could decline\n.\nIn order to expand our business, we must successfully offer, on a continuous basis, a broad selection of products that meets the needs of our customers, including by being the first to market with new SKUs. Our products are used by consumers for a variety of purposes, including repair, performance, aesthetics and functionality. In addition, to be successful, our product offerings must be broad and deep in scope, competitively priced, well-made, innovative and attractive to a wide range of consumers. We cannot predict with certainty that we will be successful in offering products that meet all of these requirements. If our product offerings fail to satisfy our customers\u2019 requirements or respond to changes in customer preferences or we otherwise fail to maintain sufficient in-stock inventory, our revenue could decline.\nAs a result of our international operations\n, we have foreign exchange risk\n.\nOur purchases of products from our China, India and Philippines suppliers are denominated in U.S. dollars; however, a change in the foreign currency exchange rates could impact our product costs over time. Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. dollar and changes in exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated gross profit and operating expenses would be higher than if currencies had remained constant.\nWe may never commercialize our new mobile device products\n.\nWe began developing our new mobile device products with apps in 2018 and intend to introduce them and our ruggedized mobile phones in 2022. Even if we are successful in developing these new products, we will not be successful in commercializing them unless these products gain market acceptance. The degree of market acceptance of these products will depend on a number of factors, including, without limitation:\n\u25cf the competitive environment;\n\u25cf our ability to enter into strategic agreements with manufacturers; and\n\u25cf the adequacy and success of distribution, sales and marketing efforts.\nEven if we successfully develop one or more of these products, we may not become profitable.\nOur products could be recalled\n.\nThe Consumer Product Safety Commission or other applicable regulatory bodies may require the recall, repair or replacement of our products if those products are found not to be in compliance with applicable standards or regulations. A recall could increase costs and adversely impact our reputation, and thereby negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRegulatory and Litigation Risks\nProduct liability claims and other kinds of litigation could affect our business\n, reputation\n, financial condition\n, results of operations and cash flows\n.\nThe products that we design and/or have manufactured can lead to product liability claims or other legal claims being filed against us. We have in the past, and may in the future, be subject to legal proceedings other than those relating to product liability claims. To the extent that plaintiffs are successful in showing that a defect in a product\u2019s design, manufacture or warnings led to personal injury or property damage, or that our provision of services resulted in similar injury or damage, we may be subject to claims for damages. Although we are insured for damages above a certain amount, we bear the costs and expenses associated with defending claims, including frivolous lawsuits, and are responsible for damages below the insurance retention amount. In addition to claims concerning individual products, as a manufacturer, we can be subject to costs, potential negative publicity and lawsuits related to product recalls, which could adversely impact our results and damage our reputation.\nEven defending against unsuccessful claims could cause us to incur significant expenses and result in a diversion of management\u2019s attention. In addition, even if the money damages themselves did not cause substantial harm to our business, the damage to our reputation and the brands offered on our websites could adversely affect our future reputation and our brand, and could result in a decline in our net sales and profitability.\nFailure to comply with privacy laws and regulations and failure to adequately protect customer data could harm our business\n, damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers\n.\nFederal and state regulations may govern the collection, use, sharing and security of data that we receive from our customers. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any data-related consent orders, U.S. Federal Trade Commission requirements or other federal, state or international privacy-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, which could potentially harm our business. Further, failure or perceived failure to comply with our policies or applicable requirements related to the collection, use or security of personal information or other privacy-related matters could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers.\nThe regulatory framework for data privacy is constantly evolving\n, and privacy concerns could adversely affect our operating results\n.\nThe regulatory framework for privacy issues is currently evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. The occurrence of unanticipated events often rapidly drives the adoption of legislation or regulation affecting the use of data and the way we conduct our business; in fact, there are active discussions among U.S. legislators around adoption of a new U.S. federal privacy law. Restrictions could be placed upon the collection, management, aggregation and use of information, which could result in a material increase in the cost of collecting and maintaining certain kinds of data. In June 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cC.C.P.A.\u201d), which took effect on January 1, 2020. The C.C.P.A. gives consumers the right to request disclosure of information collected about them, and whether that information has been sold or shared with others, the right to request deletion of personal information (subject to certain exceptions), the right to opt out of the sale of the consumer\u2019s personal information, and the right not to be discriminated against for exercising these rights. We are required to comply with the C.C.P.A. The C.C.P.A. provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The C.C.P.A. may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Some observers have noted that the C.C.P.A. could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the U.S., which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights\n, our reputation and brand could be impaired and we could lose customers\n.\nWe regard our trademarks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights important to our success. We rely on trademark and copyright law, and trade secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with employees, customers, partners and others to protect our proprietary rights. We cannot be certain that we have taken adequate steps to protect our proprietary rights, especially in countries where the laws may not protect our rights as fully as in the United States. In addition, our proprietary rights may be infringed or misappropriated, and we could be required to incur significant expenses to preserve them. The outcome of such litigation can be uncertain, and the cost of prosecuting such litigation may have an adverse impact on our earnings. We have common law trademarks, as well as pending federal trademark registrations for several marks and several registered marks. However, any registrations may not adequately cover our intellectual property or protect us against infringement by others. Effective trademark, service mark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services may be made available online. We also currently own or control a number of Internet domain names, including www.toughbuilt.com\n, and have invested time and money in the purchase of domain names and other intellectual property, which may be impaired if we cannot protect such intellectual property. We may be unable to protect these domain names or acquire or maintain relevant domain names in the United States and in other countries. If we are not able to protect our trademarks, domain names or other intellectual property, we may experience difficulties in achieving and maintaining brand recognition and customer loyalty.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property\n, our business may be adversely affected\n.\nWe must protect the proprietary nature of the intellectual property used in our business. There can be no assurance that trade secrets and other intellectual property will not be challenged, invalidated, misappropriated or circumvented by third parties. Currently, our intellectual property includes issued patents, patent applications, trademarks, trademark applications and know-how related to business, product and technology development. We plan on taking the necessary steps, including but not limited to the filing of additional patents as appropriate. There is no assurance any additional patents will issue or that when they do issue they will include all of the claims currently included in the applications. Even if they do issue, those new patents and our existing patents must be protected against possible infringement. Nonetheless, we currently rely on contractual obligations of our employees and contractors to maintain the confidentiality of our products. To compete effectively, we need to develop and continue to maintain a proprietary position with respect to our technologies, and business. The risks and uncertainties that we face with respect to intellectual property rights principally include the following:\n\u25cf patent applications that we file may not result in issued patents or may take longer than expected to result in issued patents;\n\u25cf we may be subject to interference proceedings;\n\u25cf other companies may claim that patents applied for by, assigned, or licensed to, us infringe upon their own intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf we may be subject to opposition proceedings in the U.S. and in foreign countries;\n\u25cf any patents that are issued to us may not provide meaningful protection;\n\u25cf we may not be able to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u25cf other companies may challenge patents licensed or issued to us;\n\u25cf other companies may independently develop similar or alternative technologies, or duplicate our technologies;\n\u25cf other companies may design around technologies that we have licensed or developed;\n\u25cf any patents issued to us may expire and competitors may utilize the technology found in such patents to commercialize their own products; and\n\u25cf enforcement of patents is complex, uncertain, and expensive.\nIt is also possible that others may obtain issued patents that could prevent us from commercializing certain aspects of our products or require us to obtain licenses requiring the payment of significant fees or royalties in order to enable us to conduct our business. If we license patents, our rights will depend on maintaining its obligations to the licensor under the applicable license agreement, and we may be unable to do so. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the work-for-hire, intellectual property assignment and confidentiality agreements entered into by our employees and consultants, advisors and collaborators will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets, know- how or other proprietary information. As all of our products are manufactured in China, India and the Philippines, and we may not have the same strength of intellectual property protection and enforcement in such countries as in North America or Europe. The scope and enforceability of patent claims are not systematically predictable with absolute accuracy. The strength of our own patent rights depends, in part, upon the breadth and scope of protection provided by the patent and the validity of our patents, if any.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world\n.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the United States and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for our technology and the enforcement of intellectual property. If we are unable to adequately enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nBecause we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations\n, we could incur substantial judgments\n, fines\n, legal fees and other costs as well as reputational harm\n.\nWe are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers, employees or other third parties for various reasons. The damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings could be substantial. Although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims, if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us or our customers may have a material adverse effect on our business\n, cash flow\n, financial condition or results of operations\n.\nNew income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. For example, legislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) enacted many significant changes to the U.S. tax laws. Future guidance from the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities with respect to the Tax Act may affect us, and certain aspects of the Tax Act could be repealed or modified in future legislation. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act or any newly enacted federal tax legislation. Changes in corporate tax rates, the realization of net deferred tax assets relating to our operations, the taxation of foreign earnings, and the deductibility of expenses under the Tax Act or future reform legislation could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time charges, and could increase our future U.S. tax expense.\nExisting or future government regulation could expose us to liabilities and costly changes in our business operations and could reduce customer demand for our products and services\n.\nWe are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations, including laws protecting the privacy of customer non-public information and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices, as well as laws and regulations governing businesses in general and the Internet and ecommerce and certain environmental laws. Additional laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet, the effect of which on ecommerce is uncertain. These laws may cover issues such as user privacy, spyware and the tracking of consumer activities, marketing emails and communications, other advertising and promotional practices, money transfers, pricing, content and quality of products and services, taxation, electronic contracts and other communications, intellectual property rights, and information security. Furthermore, it is not clear how existing laws such as those governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes, trespass, data mining and collection, and personal privacy apply to the Internet and ecommerce. To the extent we expand into international markets, we will be faced with complying with local laws and regulations, some of which may be materially different than U.S. laws and regulations. Any such foreign law or regulation, any new U.S. law or regulation, or the interpretation or application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet or other online services or our business in general, may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations by, among other things, impeding the growth of the Internet, subjecting us to fines, penalties, damages or other liabilities, requiring costly changes in our business operations and practices, and reducing customer demand for our products and services. We may not maintain sufficient, or any, insurance coverage to cover the types of claims or liabilities that could arise as a result of such regulation.\nPossible new tariffs that might be imposed by the United States government could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations\n.\nChanges in U.S. and foreign governments\u2019 trade policies have resulted in, and may continue to result in, tariffs on imports into and exports from the U.S., among other restrictions. Throughout 2018 and 2019, the U.S. imposed tariffs on imports from several countries, including China. If further tariffs are imposed on imports of our products, or retaliatory trade measures are taken by China or other countries in response to existing or future tariffs, we could be forced to raise prices on all of our imported products or make changes to our operations, any of which could materially harm our revenue or operating results. Any additional future tariffs or quotas imposed on our products or related materials may impact our sales, gross margin and profitability if we are unable to pass increased prices onto our customers.\nWe operate in an industry with the risk of intellectual property litigation\n. Claims of infringement against us may hurt our business\n.\nOur success depends, in part, upon non-infringement of intellectual property rights owned by others and being able to resolve claims of intellectual property infringement without major financial expenditures or adverse consequences. Participants that own, or claim to own, intellectual property may aggressively assert their rights. From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others. Future litigation may be necessary to defend us or our clients by determining the scope, enforceability, and validity of third-party proprietary rights or to establish its proprietary rights. Some competitors have substantially greater resources and are able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time. In addition, patent holding companies that focus solely on extracting royalties and settlements by enforcing patent rights may target us. Regardless of whether claims that we are infringing patents or other intellectual property rights have any merit, these claims are time consuming and costly to evaluate and defend and could:\n\u25cf adversely affect relationships with future clients;\n\u25cf cause delays or stoppages in providing products;\n\u25cf divert management\u2019s attention and resources;\n\u25cf subject us to significant liabilities; and\n\u25cf require us to cease some or all of its activities.\nIn addition to liability for monetary damages, which may be tripled and may include attorneys\u2019 fees, or, in some circumstances, damages against clients, we may be prohibited from developing, commercializing, or continuing to provide some or all of our products unless we obtain licenses from, and pay royalties to, the holders of the patents or other intellectual property rights, which may not be available on commercially favorable terms, or at all.\nGeopolitical conditions, including trade disputes and direct or indirect acts of war or terrorism, could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nSince we operate on a global basis, our operations could be disrupted by geopolitical conditions, trade disputes, international boycotts and sanctions, political and social instability, acts of war, terrorist activity or other similar events. From time to time, we could have a large investment in a particular asset type, a large revenue stream associated with a particular customer or industry, or a large number of customers located in a particular geographic region. Decreased demand from a discrete event impacting a specific asset type, customer, industry, or region in which we have a concentrated exposure could negatively impact our results of operations.\nRecently, Russia initiated significant military action against Ukraine. In response, the U.S. and certain other countries imposed significant sanctions and export controls against Russia, Belarus and certain individuals and entities connected to Russian or Belarusian political, business, and financial organizations, and the U.S. and certain other countries could impose further sanctions, trade restrictions, and other retaliatory actions should the conflict continue or worsen. It is not possible to predict the broader consequences of the conflict, including related geopolitical tensions, and the measures and retaliatory actions taken by the U.S. and other countries in respect thereof as well as any counter measures or retaliatory actions by Russia or Belarus in response, including, for example, potential cyberattacks or the disruption of energy exports, is likely to cause regional instability, geopolitical shifts, and could materially adversely affect global trade, currency exchange rates, regional economies and the global economy. The situation remains uncertain, and while it is difficult to predict the impact of any of the foregoing, the conflict and actions taken in response to the conflict could increase our costs, disrupt our supply chain, reduce our sales and earnings, impair our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities is speculative and there can be no assurance of any return on any such investment\n.\nAn investment in our securities is speculative and there can be no assurance that investors will obtain any return on their investment. Investors may be subject to substantial risks involved in an investment us, including the risk of losing their entire investment.\nOur shares will be subject to potential delisting if we do not maintain the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, including the $1.00 minimum closing bid requirement\n.\nOur failure to maintain our listing and our common stock being de-listed from Nasdaq would make it more difficult for stockholders to dispose of their common stock and more difficult to obtain accurate price quotations on our common stock.\nFor example, on May 19, 2021, the Company received a written notice from the Listing Qualifications department of Nasdaq indicating that the Company was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), which requires a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share of the Company\u2019s common stock. The Initial Notice provided the Company 180 calendar days to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). On November 16, 2021, the Company received a written letter from the Listing Qualifications department of Nasdaq notifying the Company that Nasdaq has granted the Company an additional 180 calendar days, or until May 16, 2022, to regain compliance with the requirement for the Company\u2019s shares of common stock to maintain the Minimum Bid Price Requirement.\nIf we are unable to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), Nasdaq may de-list our common stock and consequently, it would likely have an adverse effect on the market liquidity of our common stock, decrease the market price of our common stock, result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, suppliers, customers and employees and fewer business development opportunities, and adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities for financing or other purposes, or otherwise to arrange for any financing we may need in the future.\nCertain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation could allow concentration of voting power in one individual\n, which may\n, among other things\n, delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors or a takeover attempt\n, even if such events may be beneficial to our stockholders\n.\nProvisions of our Articles of Incorporation, such as our ability to designate and issue a class of preferred stock without stockholder approval, may delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors and may prevent or delay a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving our Company that is not approved by our Board, even if those events may be perceived to be in the best interests of our stockholders. For example, one or more of our affiliates could theoretically be issued a newly authorized and designated class of shares of our preferred stock. Such shares could have significant voting power, among other terms. Consequently, anyone to whom these shares were issued could have sufficient voting power to significantly influence if not control the outcome of all corporate matters submitted to the vote of our common stockholders. Those matters could include the election of directors, changes in the size and composition of the Board, and mergers and other business combinations involving our Company. In addition, through any such person\u2019s control of the Board and voting power, the affiliate may be able to control certain decisions, including decisions regarding the qualification and appointment of officers, dividend policy, access to capital (including borrowing from third-party lenders and the issuance of additional equity securities), and the acquisition or disposition of assets by our Company. In addition, the concentration of voting power in the hands of an affiliate could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company, even if the change in control would benefit our stockholders and may adversely affect the future market price of our common stock should a trading market therefor develop.\nIf you purchase shares of our common stock\n, you may experience immediate and substantial dilution in the net tangible book value of your shares\n. In addition\n, we may issue shares of common stock pursuant to our equity incentive plans and additional equity or convertible debt securities in the future\n, which may result in additional dilution to investors\n.\nWe are currently authorized to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of common stock. We may, in the future, issue previously authorized and unissued shares of common stock, which would result in the dilution of current stockholders\u2019 ownership interests. Additional shares are subject to issuance through various equity compensation plans or through the exercise of currently outstanding equity awards. The potential issuance of additional shares of common stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. We also may in the future issue additional shares of common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock in order to raise capital or effectuate other business purposes. Purchasers of the shares we sell, as well as our existing stockholders, will experience significant dilution if we sell shares at prices significantly below the price at which they invested. In addition, to the extent we need to raise additional capital in the future and we issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable for our common stock, our then existing stockholders may experience dilution and the new securities may have rights senior to those of our common stock offered in this offering. Any of the above events could significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations and cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nOur stock price has been, and may continue to be, volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, subject to material volatility. Such fluctuations could be in response to, among other things, the factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\n\u201d section, or other factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as:\n\u2022 the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting impact on stock market performance;\n\u2022 fluctuations in our financial results or outlook, or those of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022 changes in the prices of commodities associated with our business;\n\u2022 changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of debt;\n\u2022 announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic partnerships;\n\u2022 regulatory developments;\n\u2022 litigation involving us or our general industry;\n\u2022 additions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u2022 changes in general economic, industry and market conditions.\nFurthermore, stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected, and continue to affect, the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rate changes and international currency fluctuations, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nAdditionally, the global economy and financial markets may be adversely affected by geopolitical events, including the current or anticipated impact of military conflict and related sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States and other countries due to Russia\u2019s recent invasion of Ukraine.\nIn the past, many companies that have experienced volatility and sustained declines in the market price of their stock have become subject to securities class action and derivative action litigation. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could materially harm our business. Any insurance we maintain may not provide adequate coverage against potential losses from such securities litigation, and if claims or losses exceed our liability insurance coverage, our business would be adversely impacted. In addition, insurance coverage may become more expensive, which would harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need\n, but be unable\n, to obtain additional funding on satisfactory terms\n, which could dilute our stockholders or impose burdensome financial restrictions on our business\n.\nWe have relied upon cash from financing activities and in the future, we hope to rely on revenues generated from operations to fund the cash requirements of our activities. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate any significant cash from our operating activities in the future. Future financing may not be available on a timely basis, in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any debt financing or other financing of securities senior to the common stock will likely include financial and other covenants that will restrict our flexibility. Any failure to comply with these covenants would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations because we could lose our existing sources of funding and impair our ability to secure new sources of funding.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources\n, divert management\n\u2019s attention and affect our results of operations\n.\nAs a public company in the United States, we face increased legal, accounting, administrative, and other costs and expenses. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. For example, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that our management report on the effectiveness of our internal controls structure and procedures for financial reporting. Section 404 compliance may divert internal resources and will take a significant amount of time and effort to complete. If we fail to maintain compliance under Section 404, or if in the future management determines that our internal control over financial reporting are not effective as defined under Section 404, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities. Furthermore, investor perceptions of our Company may suffer, and this could cause a decline in the market price of our common stock. Any failure of our internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our stated results of operations and harm our reputation. If we are unable to implement these changes effectively or efficiently, it could harm our operations, financial reporting or financial results and could result in an adverse opinion on internal controls from our independent auditors. We may need to hire a number of additional employees with public accounting and disclosure experience in order to meet our ongoing obligations as a public company, particularly if we become fully subject to Section 404 and its auditor attestation requirements, which will increase costs. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly, although we are currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. A number of those requirements will require us to carry out activities we have not done previously. Our management team and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to new compliance initiatives and to meeting the obligations that are associated with being a public company, which may divert attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the expenses incurred by public companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. These increased costs will require us to divert a significant amount of money that we could otherwise use to develop our business. If we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions, and other regulatory action, and potentially civil litigation.\nNew laws\n, regulations\n, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure may create uncertainty for public companies\n, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming\n.\nThese laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by the courts and other bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected.\nAs a public company subject to these rules and regulations, we may find it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult in the future for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board, particularly to serve on its Audit Committee and Compensation Committee, and qualified executive officers.\nAs an\n\u201cemerging growth company\n\u201d under applicable law\n, we will be subject to lessened disclosure requirements\n, which could leave our stockholders without information or rights available to stockholders of more mature companies\n.\nFor as long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jobs Act, we have elected to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u25cf being permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements disclosure;\n\u25cf taking advantage of an extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards;\n\u25cf reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and\n\u25cf exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe expect to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d Because of these lessened regulatory requirements, our stockholders are not provided information or rights available to stockholders of more mature companies. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe are also a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and have elected to follow certain scaled disclosure requirements available to smaller reporting companies.\nIf research analysts do not publish research about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock\n, our stock price and trading volume could decline\n.\nThe trading market for our securities may depend in part on the research and reports that research analysts publish about us and our business. If we do not maintain adequate research coverage, or if any of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our common stock and warrants could decline. If one or more of our research analysts ceases to cover our business or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our securities could decrease, which could cause the price of our common stock and warrants or trading volume to decline.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future\n, and consequently\n, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock\n.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Nevada law could discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our Company and may affect the trading price of our common stock\n.\nWe are a Nevada corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Nevada Control Shares Acquisition Act may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control by limiting the voting rights of control shares acquired in a control share acquisition. In addition, our Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws (\u201cBylaws\u201d) may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. Among other things, our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws:\n\u25cf authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our Board in response to a takeover attempt;\n\u25cf provide that vacancies on our Board, including newly created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office, except a vacancy occurring by reason of the removal of a director without cause shall be filled by vote of the stockholders; and\n\u25cf limit who may call special meetings of stockholders.\nThese provisions could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, whether or not it is desired by, or beneficial to, our stockholders.\nThe security of our information technology systems may be compromised in the event of system failures, unauthorized access, cyberattacks or a deficiency in our cybersecurity, and confidential information, including non-public personal information that we maintain, could be improperly disclosed.\nWe rely extensively on information technology and systems including internet sites, data hosting, physical security, and software applications and platforms. Despite our security measures, our information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, power outages, user errors or catastrophic events. A significant breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of critical information technology systems, by our employees, others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact or interrupt operations. The use of technology, including cloud-based computing, creates opportunities for the unintentional dissemination or intentional destruction of confidential information stored in our systems or our third-party systems. We could also experience a business interruption, theft of confidential information or reputational damage from malware or other cyberattacks, which may compromise our systems or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers.\nAs part of our business, we maintain large amounts of confidential information, including non-public personal information on customers and our employees. Breaches in security, either internally or at our third-party providers, could result in the loss or misuse of this information, which could, in turn, result in potential regulatory actions or litigation, including material claims for damages, interruption to our operations, damage to our reputation or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Although we maintain information security policies and systems designed to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information, including non-public personal information, there can be no assurance that such use or disclosure will not occur.\nAny such business interruption, theft of confidential information or reputational damage from malware or other cyberattacks, or violation of personal information laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 18320, "SIC": 3420, "TIC": "TBLT"}
