{"cik": "944695", "company": "HANOVER INSURANCE GROUP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nRISK FACTORS AND FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nWe wish to caution readers that the following important factors, among others, in some cases have affected, and in the future could affect, our actual results and could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results and from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made from time to time by us on the basis of our then-current expectations. The words \u201cbelieves\u201d, \u201canticipates\u201d, \u201cexpects\u201d, \u201cprojections\u201d, \u201coutlook\u201d, \u201cshould\u201d, \u201ccould\u201d, \u201cplan\u201d, \u201cguidance\u201d, \u201clikely\u201d, \u201con track to\u201d, \u201ctargeted\u201d and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Our businesses are in rapidly changing and competitive markets and involve a high degree of risk and unpredictability. Forward-looking projections are subject to these risks and unpredictability.\nRisks Related to Underwriting, Risk Aggregation and Risk Management\nOur results may fluctuate as a result of cyclical or non-cyclical changes in the property and casualty insurance industry.\nThe property and casualty insurance industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties. Our profitability is materially affected by the following items:\n\u2022\nincreases in costs, particularly increases occurring after the time our insurance products are priced, including construction, automobile repair, and medical and rehabilitation costs. This includes inflation, rises in the cost of products due to tariffs or other factors and \u201ccost shifting\u201d from health insurers to casualty and liability insurers (whether as a result of an increasing number of injured parties without health insurance, coverage changes in health policies to make such coverage secondary to casualty policies, the further implementation or the repeal of national healthcare legislation, lower reimbursement rates for the same procedures by health insurers or government-sponsored insurance, or the implementation of the Medicare Secondary Payer Act, which imposes reporting and other requirements with respect to medical and related claims paid for Medicare eligible individuals). As it relates to construction, there are often temporary increases in the cost of building supplies and construction labor after a significant event (for example, so called \u201cdemand surge\u201d that causes the cost of labor, construction materials and other items to increase in a geographic area affected by a catastrophe). In addition, we are limited in our ability to negotiate and manage reimbursable expenses incurred by our policyholders;\n\u2022\ncompetitive and regulatory pressures, which affect the prices of our products and the nature of the risks covered;\n\u2022\nvolatile and unpredictable developments, including severe weather, catastrophes, wildfires, civil unrest, pandemics and terrorist actions;\n\u2022\nlegal, regulatory and socio-economic developments, such as new theories of insured and insurer liability and related claims and extra-contractual awards such as punitive damages, financed litigation, where a third party unrelated to a lawsuit provides capital to a plaintiff in return for a portion of any financial recovery from the lawsuit, and \u201csocial inflation\u201d or other increases in the costs of litigation, size of jury awards or changes in applicable laws and regulations (such as changes in the thresholds affecting \u201cno fault\u201d liability or when non-economic damages are recoverable for bodily injury claims or coverage requirements) that impact our claim payouts;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in interest rates, as a result of a change in monetary policy or otherwise, inflationary pressures, default rates, commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and other factors that affect net income, including with respect to investment returns and operating results for certain of our lines of business; and\n\u2022\nother general economic conditions and trends that may affect the adequacy of reserves.\nThe demand for property and casualty insurance can also vary significantly based on general economic conditions (either nationally or regionally), rising as the overall level of economic activity increases and falling as such activity decreases. Loss patterns also tend to vary inversely with local economic conditions, increasing during difficult or unstable economic times and moderating during economic upswings or periods of stability. The current Pandemic has introduced additional complexity to loss patterns. The fluctuations in demand and competition could produce unpredictable underwriting results.\nDue to geographical concentration in our property and casualty business, changes in economic, regulatory and other conditions in the regions where we operate could have a significant negative impact on our business as a whole. Geographic concentrations also expose us to losses that are potentially disproportionate to our market share in the event of natural or other catastrophes.\nWe generate a significant portion of our property and casualty insurance net premiums written and earnings in Michigan, Massachusetts and other states in the Northeast, including New York. In addition, a significant amount of Commercial Lines\u2019 net written premium is generated in California. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 21.0% and 9.2% of our net premiums written in our property and casualty business were generated in the states of Michigan and Massachusetts, respectively, and 11.6% of our Commercial Lines\u2019 net premiums written was generated in California. Many states in which we do business impose significant rate control and residual market charges and restrict an insurer\u2019s ability to exit such markets (for example, the Insurance Commissioner in California has taken steps to limit non-renewal of property policies in geographic areas prone to wildfires). The revenues and profitability of our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are subject to prevailing economic, regulatory, demographic and other conditions, including adverse weather in Michigan and the Northeast. Because of our geographic concentration\nin certain regions, our business, as a whole, could be significantly affected by changes in the economic, regulatory and other conditions in such areas.\nFurther, certain new catastrophe models assume an increase in frequency and severity of certain weather or other events, such as fires, whether as a result of global climate change or otherwise. Financial strength rating agencies emphasize capital and reinsurance adequacy for insurers with geographic concentrations of risk that may be subject to disproportionate risk of loss. These factors also may result in insurers seeking to diversify their geographic exposure, which could result in increased regulatory restrictions in those markets where insurers seek to exit or reduce coverage, as well as an increase in competitive pressures in less weather-exposed markets.\nOur profitability may be adversely affected if our pricing models differ materially from actual results.\nThe profitability of our business depends on the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we use in pricing our policies. We price our business in a manner that is intended to be consistent, over time, with actual results and return objectives. Our estimates and models, and/or the assumptions behind them, may differ materially from actual results.\nIf we fail to appropriately price the risks we insure, fail to change or are slow to change our pricing model to appropriately reflect our current experience, or if our claims experience is more frequent or severe than our underlying risk assumptions, our profit margins will be negatively affected. If we underestimate the frequency and/or severity of extreme adverse events occurring, our financial condition may be adversely affected. If we overestimate the risks we are exposed to, we may overprice our products, and new business growth and retention of our existing business may be adversely affected.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to manage risk, and the failure of the risk mitigation strategies we utilize could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business performance is highly dependent on our ability to manage operational risks that arise from a large number of day-to-day business activities, including insurance underwriting, claims processing, servicing, investment, financial and tax reporting, compliance with regulatory requirements and other activities. We utilize numerous strategies to mitigate our insurance risk exposure, including: underwriting; setting exposure limits, deductibles and exclusions to mitigate policy risk; updating and reviewing the terms and conditions of our policies; managing risk aggregation by product line, geography, industry type, credit exposure and other bases; and ceding insurance risk. We seek to monitor and control our exposure to risks arising out of these activities through an enterprise-wide risk management framework. However, there are inherent limitations in all of these tactics, and no assurance can be given that these processes and procedures will effectively control all known risks or effectively identify unforeseen risks or that an event or series of events will not result in loss levels in excess of our probable maximum loss models, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. It is also possible that losses could manifest themselves in ways that we do not anticipate and that our risk mitigation strategies are not designed to address. Such a manifestation of losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. These risks may be heightened during times of challenging macroeconomic conditions.\nRisks Related to Reserves and Claims\nActual losses from claims against our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries may exceed their reserves for claims.\nOur property and casualty insurance subsidiaries maintain reserves to cover their estimated ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, reserves represent estimates, involving actuarial projections and judgments at a given time, of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of incurred claims will cost based on facts and circumstances then known, predictions of future events, estimates of future trends in claims frequency and severity and judicial theories of liability, costs of repair and replacement, legislative activity and myriad other factors.\nThe inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of property and casualty insurance lines. These include automobile bodily injury liability, automobile personal injury protection, general liability, and workers\u2019 compensation, where a longer period of time may elapse before a definitive determination of ultimate liability may be made, environmental liability, where the technological, judicial and political climates involving these types of claims are continuously evolving, and casualty coverages such as professional liability. There is also greater uncertainty in establishing reserves with respect to new business, particularly new business that is generated with respect to newer product lines, such as our financial institutions and cyber-risk lines, by newly appointed agents, or in new geographies where we have less experience in conducting business. In these cases, there is less historical experience or knowledge and less data that the actuaries can rely on. Estimating reserves is further complicated by unexpected claims or unintended coverages that emerge due to changing conditions. These emerging issues may increase the size or number of claims beyond our underwriting intent and may not become apparent for many years after a policy is issued, such as was the case for the industry with respect to environmental, asbestos, and certain product liability claims. Similar concerns have emerged with what has been called \u201csilent\u201d cyber, or claims arising for cyber losses under traditional policies where such coverage is not contemplated. These losses are reflected as prior year reserve development. Although we undertake underwriting actions that are intended or designed to limit losses\nonce emerging issues are identified, we remain subject to losses on policies issued during those years preceding the underwriting actions.\nAdditionally, the introduction of new Commercial Lines products and the development of new niche and specialty lines present new risks. Certain specialty products, such as the human services program, non-profit directors and officers liability and employment practices liability policies, lawyers and other professional liability policies, healthcare lines and directors and officers coverage may also require a longer period of time (the so-called \u201ctail\u201d) to determine the ultimate liability associated with the claims and may produce more volatility in our results and less certainty in our accident year reserves. Some lines of business, such as surety, are less susceptible to establishing reserves based on actuarial or historical experience and losses may be episodic, depending on economic and other factors. Changes in laws, such as so-called \u201creviver\u201d statutes that retrospectively change the statutes of limitations for certain claims, such as sexual molestation claims, add further uncertainty to the adequacy of prior estimates.\nWe regularly review our reserving techniques, reinsurance and the overall adequacy of our reserves based upon, among other things:\n\u2022\nour review of historical data, legislative enactments, judicial decisions, legal developments and trends in imposition of damages, changes in political attitudes and trends in general economic conditions;\n\u2022\nour review of per claim information;\n\u2022\nhistorical loss experience of our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries and the industry as a whole; and\n\u2022\nthe terms of our property and casualty insurance policies.\nUnderwriting results and operating income could be adversely affected by further changes in our net loss and LAE estimates related to significant events or emerging risks, such as risks related to attacks on or breaches of cloud-based data information storage or computer network systems (\u201ccyber-risks\u201d), privacy regulations or disruptions caused by major power grid failures or widespread electrical and electronic equipment failure due to aging infrastructure, natural factors like hurricanes, earthquakes, wildfires, solar flares and pandemic or man-made factors like terrorism and civil unrest.\nEstimating losses following any major catastrophe or with respect to emerging claims is an inherently uncertain process. Factors that add to the complexity of estimating losses from these events include the legal and regulatory uncertainty, the complexity of factors contributing to the losses, delays in claim reporting, and with respect to areas with significant property damage, the impact of \u201cdemand surge\u201d and a slower pace of recovery resulting from the extent of damage sustained in the affected areas due, in part, to the availability and cost of resources to effect repairs. Emerging claims issues may involve complex coverage, liability and other costs which could significantly affect LAE. As a result, there can be no assurance that our ultimate costs associated with these events or issues will not be substantially different from current estimates (for example, actual losses arising from an event could have varied widely depending on the interpretation of various policy provisions). Investors should consider the risks and uncertainties in our business that may affect net loss and LAE reserve estimates and future performance, including the difficulties in arriving at such estimates.\nAnticipated losses associated with business interruption exposure, the impact of wind versus water as the cause of loss, disputes over the extent of damage caused by hail storms (particularly with respect to roof damage claims), supplemental payments on previously closed claims caused by the development of latent damages or new theories of liability and inflationary pressures leading to claims cost escalation could also have a negative impact on future loss reserve development. Many states permit insureds to simply sign-over their claims to contractors or others (so-called \u201cassignment of benefits\u201d), which frequently generate higher claim demands. Other states permit filing of suits without prior discussions, which has a similar effect and also increases loss adjustment costs.\nBecause of the inherent uncertainties involved in setting reserves and establishing current and prior-year \u201closs picks\u201d, including those related to catastrophes, we cannot provide assurance that the existing reserves or future reserves established by our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries will prove adequate in light of subsequent events. Our results of operations and financial condition have in the past been, and in the future could be, materially affected by adverse loss development for events that we insured in prior periods.\nRisks Related to Weather Events, Catastrophes and Climate Change\nLimitations on the ability to predict the potential impact of weather events and catastrophes may impact our future profits and cash flows.\nOur business is subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We have experienced, and in the future may experience, catastrophe losses that could have a material adverse impact on our business. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, wind, hail, fires, drought, severe winter weather, volcanic eruptions, tropical storms, tsunamis, sabotage, civil unrest, terrorist actions, explosions, nuclear accidents, solar flares, and power outages. The frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable.\nThe extent of gross losses from a catastrophe is a function of the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. The extent of net losses depends on the amount and collectability of reinsurance.\nAdditionally, the severity of certain catastrophes could be so significant that it restricts the ability of certain locations to recover their economic viability in the near term. And, repeated catastrophes or the threat of catastrophes could undermine the long-term economic viability of certain locations like coastal or wildfire-exposed communities, which could have a significant negative impact on our business.\nAlthough catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of property and casualty lines, homeowners and commercial multiple peril property insurance have, in the past, generated the vast majority of our catastrophe-related claims. Our catastrophe losses have historically been principally weather-related, particularly from hurricanes and hail damage, as well as snow and ice damage from winter storms.\nAlthough the insurance industry and rating agencies have developed various models intended to help estimate potential insured losses under thousands of scenarios, there is no reliable way of predicting the probability of such events or the magnitude of such losses before a specific event occurs. We utilize various models and other techniques in an attempt to measure and manage potential catastrophe losses within various income and capital risk appetites. However, such models and techniques have many limitations. In addition, due to historical concentrations of business, regulatory restrictions and other factors, our ability to manage such concentrations is limited, particularly in the Northeast and in the state of Michigan.\nWe purchase catastrophe reinsurance as protection against catastrophe losses. Reinsurance is subject to the adequacy and counterparty reinsurance risks described below. Should we experience losses from one significant or several large catastrophes, there can be no assurance that our reinsurance program will provide adequate coverage levels.\nClimate change may adversely impact our results of operations and/or our financial position.\nGlobal climate change from rising planet temperatures over the last several decades has been linked to a number of factors that contribute to the increased unpredictability, frequency, duration and severity of weather events, including: changing weather patterns, a rise in ocean temperatures, and sea level rise. Further increases or persistence in these conditions would lead to higher overall losses, which we may not be able to recoup, particularly in a highly regulated and competitive environment, and higher reinsurance costs. Certain catastrophe models assume an increase in frequency and severity of certain weather or other events, which could result in a disproportionate impact on insurers with certain geographic concentrations of risk. This would also likely increase the risks of writing property insurance in coastal areas or areas susceptible to wildfires or flooding, particularly in jurisdictions that restrict pricing and underwriting flexibility. The threat of rising seas or other catastrophe losses as a result of global climate change may also cause property values in coastal or such other communities to decrease, reducing the total amount of insurance coverage that is required.\nIn addition, global climate change could impact assets that we invest in, resulting in realized and unrealized losses in future periods that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and/or financial position. It is not possible to foresee which, if any, assets, industries or markets will be materially and adversely affected, nor is it possible to foresee the magnitude of such effect.\nRisks Related to Reinsurance\nWe cannot guarantee the adequacy of or ability to maintain our current level of reinsurance coverage.\nSimilar to insurance companies, reinsurance companies can also be adversely impacted when catastrophes occur. In setting our retention levels and coverage limits, we consider our level of statutory surplus and exposures, as well as the current reinsurance pricing environment, but there can be no assurance that we adequately set these levels or limits or that we will be able to maintain our current or desired levels of reinsurance coverage. In particular, and as discussed under \u201cReinsurance Program Overview\u201d in Information About Operating Segments - Reinsurance, not all of our 2021 reinsurance programs for the Commercial and Personal Lines are fully placed. Reinsurance is a significant factor in our overall cost of providing primary insurance. However, unlike primary insurers, reinsurers are not subject to rate or other restrictions requiring them to continue availability of reinsurance or limiting cost increases or mandating coverage forms. An individual insurer\u2019s reinsurance expense is correlated to the level of losses experienced by its reinsurers. Future catastrophic events and other changes in the reinsurance marketplace, including as a result of investment losses or disruptions due to challenges in the financial markets that have occurred or could occur in the future, may adversely affect our ability to obtain such coverages, as well as adversely affect the cost of obtaining that coverage.\nAdditionally, the availability, scope of coverage, cost, and creditworthiness of reinsurance could continue to be adversely affected as a result of not only new catastrophes, but also terrorist attacks and the perceived risks associated with future terrorist activities, global conflicts, including the threat of nuclear conflict, and the changing legal and regulatory environment (including changes which could create new insured risks). Federal reinsurance for terrorism risks coverage offered by insurers is available under the federal terrorism risk insurance program, but it only applies to certified events of terrorism (as defined in the legislation) and contains certain caps and deductibles. Although the federal terrorism risk insurance program coverage is in effect through December 31, 2027, should this program be modified unfavorably by the government in the future, private reinsurance for events of terrorism may not be available to us or available at reasonable or acceptable rates.\nAlthough we monitor their financial soundness, we cannot be sure that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion, if at all.\nWe purchase reinsurance by transferring (known as ceding) part of the risk that we have assumed to reinsurance companies in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk. As of December 31, 2020, our reinsurance receivable (including from the MCCA) amounted to approximately $1.9 billion. Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer, it does not relieve us (the reinsured) of our liability to our policyholders. Accordingly, we bear counterparty risk with respect to our reinsurers, including risks resulting from over-concentration of exposures within the industry. Although we monitor the financial strength ratings assigned to them by rating agencies, their reputations in the reinsurance marketplace, our collections history with them, the credit quality of our reinsurers, and the analysis and guidance of our reinsurance advisors, and we believe that the financial condition of our reinsurers is sound, we cannot be sure that they will pay the reinsurance recoverables owed to us currently or in the future or that they will pay such recoverables on a timely basis. The contractual obligations under reinsurance agreements are typically with individual subsidiaries of the reinsurance group and are not typically guaranteed by other group members. In certain circumstances, with \u201cunauthorized\u201d reinsurers or those with lower financial strength ratings, we may require collateral equal to 100% of estimated reinsurance recoverables. The collateral can serve to mitigate credit risk. In the event of losses, we may look to \u201cdraw down\u201d on this collateral to satisfy reinsurance recoveries due to us, but if the collateral held is insufficient to meet those recoveries, we will be exposed to losses.\nRisks Related to Regulation, Mandatory Market Mechanisms and Mandatory Assessments\nOur businesses are heavily regulated, and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability.\nOur insurance businesses are subject to supervision and regulation by the state insurance authority in each state where we transact business. This system of supervision and regulation relates to numerous aspects of an insurance company\u2019s business and financial condition, including limitations on the authorization of lines of business, underwriting limitations, the ability to utilize credit-based insurance scores, gender, geographic location, information publicly available (such as on social media), education, occupation, income or other factors in underwriting, the ability to terminate agents, supervisory and liability responsibilities for agents, the setting of premium rates, the requirement to write certain classes of business that we might otherwise avoid or charge different premium rates, restrictions on the ability to withdraw from certain lines of business or terminate policies or classes of policyholders, the establishment of standards of solvency, the licensing of insurers and agents, compensation of and contractual arrangements with independent agents, concentration of investments, levels of reserves, the payment of dividends, transactions with affiliates, changes of control, protection of private information of our agents, policyholders, claimants and others (which may include highly sensitive financial or medical information or other private information such as social security numbers, driving records or driver\u2019s license numbers) and the approval of policy forms. From time to time, various states and Congress have proposed to prohibit or otherwise restrict the use of credit-based insurance scores in underwriting or rating our Personal Lines business. The elimination of the use of credit-based insurance scores could cause significant disruption to our business and our confidence in our pricing and underwriting. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors.\nLegislative and regulatory restrictions are constantly evolving and are subject to then-current political pressures. For example, following major events, states have considered, and in some cases adopted, proposals such as homeowners\u2019 \u201cBill of Rights\u201d, restrictions on storm deductibles, additional mandatory claim handling guidelines and mandatory coverages. More recently, the California Insurance Commissioner restricted the ability of carriers to non-renew certain coverages in wildfire disaster areas, and the New York Department of Financial Services and regulatory agencies in other states have enacted comprehensive cybersecurity regulations and required insurers to take steps related to global climate change.\nAlso, the federal Medicare, Medicaid and State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program Extension Act mandates reporting and other requirements applicable to property and casualty insurance companies that make payments to or on behalf of claimants who are eligible for Medicare benefits. These requirements have made bodily injury claim resolutions more difficult, particularly for complex matters or for injuries requiring treatment over an extended period, and impose significant penalties for non-compliance and reporting errors. These requirements also have increased the circumstances under which the federal government may seek to recover from insurers amounts paid to claimants in circumstances where the government had previously paid benefits.\nState regulatory oversight and various proposals at the federal level, through the Federal Insurance Office or other agencies, may, in the future, adversely affect our ability to sustain adequate returns in certain lines of business or in some cases, operate lines profitably. In recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny, and certain state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that alter and, in many cases, increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding company systems.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by adverse state and federal legislation or regulation, or judicial developments, including those resulting in: decreases in rates, including for example, recent regulatory or bureau actions to mandate reduced premiums for workers\u2019 compensation insurance; limitations on premium levels; coverage and benefit mandates; limitations on the ability to manage care and utilization or other claim costs; requirements to write certain classes of business or in certain geographies; restrictions on underwriting, methods of compensating independent producers, or our ability to cancel or renew certain business (which negatively affects our ability to reduce concentrations of property risks); higher liability exposures for our insureds; increased assessments or\nhigher premium or other taxes; and enhanced ability to pierce \u201cno fault\u201d thresholds, recover non-economic damages (such as \u201cpain and suffering\u201d), or pierce policy limits.\nThese regulations serve to protect customers and other third parties and are heavily influenced by the then-current political environment. If we are found to have violated an applicable regulation, administrative or judicial proceedings may be initiated against us that could result in censures, fines, civil penalties (including punitive damages), the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, premium refunds or the reopening of closed claim files, among other consequences. These actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nIn addition, we are reliant upon independent agents and brokers to market our products. Changes in regulations related to insurance agents and brokers that materially impact the profitability of the agent and broker business or that restrict the ability of agents and brokers to market and sell insurance products would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurther, as we continue to expand our business into new regions, either organically or through acquisition, we become subject to the regulations and different regulatory bodies governing such business in those locales.\nFrom time to time, we are also involved in investigations and proceedings by federal, state, and other governmental and self-regulatory agencies. We cannot provide assurance that these investigations, proceedings and inquiries will not result in actions that would adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are subject to uncertainties related to Michigan PIP Reform.\nStarting in 1973, the state of Michigan required all personal and commercial automobile polices issued in the state to include no-fault personal injury protection (\u201cPIP\u201d) coverage without a cap on maximum benefits allowed (i.e., \u201cunlimited PIP benefits\u201d). Insurers were required to retain a portion of the risk and the MCCA, a legislatively-created reinsurance mechanism, reinsures the portion of the risk in excess of the insurer\u2019s mandated retention. The mandatory retention amount increases biennially at a statutory mandated rate and is currently $580,000. Premiums on Michigan automobile policies include a charge for both the insurer\u2019s retained amount and a separately identified pass-through charge determined by the MCCA.\nIn response to concerns about the overall cost and affordability of automobile insurance in Michigan, the state enacted legislation in June 2019 that significantly changed no-fault and PIP systems. The new legislation, effective July 2, 2020, eliminated the requirement that all insureds purchase unlimited PIP coverage and substituted instead tiered limits, ranging from zero (for those with certain health benefits meeting specified criteria) to unlimited benefits. In contrast, the minimum amounts of bodily injury coverage drivers are required to purchase increased, and we anticipate an increase in tort liability and related litigation from these changes. The legislation includes underwriting and other restrictions and mandates, in addition to subjecting rates, forms and rules to prior approval from the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services (\u201cMichigan Insurance Department\u201d) before implementation.\nThe legislation also imposes various cost controls, including medical fee schedules based on a multiple of Medicare reimbursement rates, and mandated PIP premium rate reductions with an eight-year premium rate freeze for the PIP component of automobile policies. The Michigan Insurance Department is also preparing regulations to establish utilization controls. The rate freeze was effective contemporaneously with the adoption of the legislation and the mandatory rate reduction was effective July 2, 2020. The expense and utilization controls do not go into effect until July 1, 2021.\nIn response to the future savings expected to be garnered from the expense and utilization controls, the MCCA reassessed its outstanding liabilities and estimated that the deficit reported in more recent years had been \u201cerased\u201d (notwithstanding a persistent reported annual deficit, the MCCA\u2019s annual operations have always been cash flow positive). As of December 31, 2020, our estimated reinsurance recoverable from the MCCA was $1.0 billion. This estimate has not been reduced for the potential future claim cost savings.\nMany medical and other providers who receive reimbursement under the PIP system strenuously objected to the fee schedules, cost controls and utilization restrictions imposed by the new legislation. Since the reform legislation was adopted, we have experienced an increase in litigation from medical and other providers demanding higher reimbursements under the current system. On October 3, 2019, litigation captioned Andary et. al. v. USAA Casualty Insurance Company and Citizens Insurance Company of America (a subsidiary of THG), Circuit Court for the County of Ingham, Michigan Case 19-738-CZ, was filed. The plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the fee schedules, attendant care reimbursement limits, cost controls and utilization provisions of the new legislation violate multiple provisions of the Michigan state constitution. We intend to vigorously contest plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\nFor the year ending December 31, 2020, Michigan personal automobile insurance represented approximately 47% of our total personal automobile net premiums written. PIP net written premium (which does not include the MCCA pass-through assessment) represents approximately 26% of those Michigan personal automobile premiums. It is not clear at this time whether projected savings from the various cost control measures, assuming they remain in effect, will be commensurate with the required PIP reductions and rate controls. Accordingly, there is increased uncertainty attributable to these changes regarding the future performance of our Michigan personal automobile lines.\nWe may incur financial losses resulting from our participation in shared market mechanisms, mandatory reinsurance programs and mandatory and voluntary pooling arrangements.\nIn most of the jurisdictions that we operate in, our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are required to participate in mandatory property and casualty shared market mechanisms, government-sponsored reinsurance programs or pooling arrangements. These arrangements are designed to provide various insurance coverages to individuals or other entities that are otherwise unable to purchase such coverage or to support the costs of uninsured motorist claims in a particular state or region. We cannot predict whether our participation in these shared market mechanisms or pooling arrangements will provide underwriting profits or losses to us. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we experienced an underwriting loss of $10.5 million from participation in these mechanisms and pooling arrangements, compared to underwriting losses of $14.1 million and $23.2 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. We may face similar or more significant earnings fluctuations in the future.\nAdditionally, increases in the number of participants or insureds in state-sponsored reinsurance pools, FAIR plans or other residual market mechanisms, particularly in the states of Massachusetts, Texas, California, New York, or North Carolina, combined with regulatory restrictions on the ability to adequately price, underwrite, or non-renew business, as well as new legislation, or changes in existing case law, could expose us to significant risks of increased assessments from these residual market mechanisms. There could also be a significant adverse impact as a result of losses incurred in those states due to hurricane or other high loss exposures, as well as the declining number of carriers providing coverage in those regions. We are unable to predict the likelihood or impact of such potential assessments or other actions.\nWe also have credit risk associated with certain mandatory reinsurance programs, such as the MCCA. See \u201cWe are subject to uncertainties related to Michigan PIP Reform,\u201d above for more information on the MCCA.\nIn addition, we may be adversely affected by liabilities resulting from our previous participation in certain voluntary property and casualty assumed reinsurance pools. We have terminated our participation in virtually all property and casualty voluntary pools, but we remain subject to claims related to the periods when we participated. The property and casualty industry\u2019s assumed reinsurance businesses have suffered substantial losses during the past several years, particularly related to environmental and asbestos exposure for property and casualty coverages, in some cases resulting from incidents alleged to have occurred decades ago. Due to the inherent volatility in these businesses, possible issues related to the enforceability of reinsurance treaties in the industry and the continuing history of increased losses, we cannot provide assurance that our current reserves are adequate or that we will not incur losses in the future. Our operating results and financial position may be adversely affected by liabilities resulting from any such claims in excess of our loss estimates. As of December 31, 2020, our reserves totaled $40.0 million for these legacy voluntary property and casualty assumed reinsurance pools, with the largest being the Excess Casualty Reinsurance Association pool.\nWe are subject to mandatory assessments by state guaranty funds; an increase in these assessments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAll fifty U.S. states and the District of Columbia have insurance guaranty fund laws requiring property and casualty insurance companies doing business within the state to participate in guaranty associations. These associations are organized to pay contractual obligations under insurance policies issued by impaired or insolvent insurance companies. The associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired or insolvent insurer is engaged. Although mandatory assessments by state guaranty funds that are used to cover losses to policyholders of insolvent or rehabilitated companies can be substantially recovered over time through policyholder surcharges or a reduction in future premium taxes in many states (provided the collecting insurer continues to write business in such state), there can be no assurance that all funds will be recoupable in the future. During 2020, we had a total assessment of $1.4 million levied against us, with refunds of $0.4 million received in 2020 for a total net assessment of $1.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, we have $0.5 million of reserves related to guaranty fund assessments. In the future, these assessments may increase above levels experienced in prior years. Future increases in these assessments depend upon the rate of insolvencies of insurance companies.\nWe are subject to litigation risks, including risks relating to the application and interpretation of contracts, and adverse outcomes in litigation and legal proceedings could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to litigation risks, including risks relating to the application and interpretation of insurance and reinsurance contracts and our handling of claim matters (which can lead to bad faith and other forms of extra-contractual liability), and are routinely involved in litigation that challenges specific terms and language incorporated into property and casualty contracts, such as claims reimbursements, covered perils and exclusion clauses, among others, or the interpretation or administration of such contracts. We are also involved in legal actions that do not arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which assert claims for substantial amounts. Adverse outcomes could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Agency Distribution and Growth Strategies\nOur profitability could be adversely affected by our relationships with our agencies.\nSubstantially all of our products are distributed through independent agents and brokers who have the principal relationships with policyholders. Agents and brokers generally own the \u201crenewal rights,\u201d and thus our business model is dependent on our relationships with, and the success of, the agents and brokers we do business with.\nWe periodically review the agencies, including managing general agencies we do business with to identify those that do not meet our profitability standards or are not aligned with our business objectives. Following these periodic reviews, we may restrict such agencies\u2019 access to certain types of policies or terminate our relationship with them, subject to applicable contractual and regulatory requirements that limit our ability to terminate agents or require us to renew policies. Even through the utilization of these measures, we may not achieve the desired results.\nBecause we rely on independent agents as our sales channel, any deterioration in the relationships with our independent agents or failure to provide competitive compensation to our independent agents could lead agents to place more premium with other carriers and less premium with us. In addition, we could be adversely affected if the agencies we do business with, including managing general agencies, exceed the authority that we have given them, fail to transfer collected premium to us or breach the obligations that they owe to us. Although we routinely monitor our agency relationships, such actions could expose us to liability.\nAlso, if agency consolidation continues at its current pace or increases in the future and more agencies are consolidated into larger agencies or managing general agencies, our sales channel could be materially affected in a number of ways, including loss of market access or market share in certain geographic areas if an acquirer is not one of our appointed agencies, loss of agency talent as the people most knowledgeable about our products and with whom we have developed strong working relationships exit the business following a disposition of an agency, increases in our commission costs as larger agencies acquire more negotiating leverage over their fees, and interference with the core agency business of selling insurance due to integration or distraction. Any such disruption that materially affects our sales channel could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs the speed of digitization accelerates, we are subject to risks associated with both our agents\u2019 and our ability to keep pace. In an increasingly digital world, agents who cannot provide a digital or technology-driven experience risk losing customers who demand such an experience, and such customers may choose to utilize more technology-driven agents or abandon the independent agency channel altogether. Additionally, if we are not able to keep pace with competitors\u2019 digital offerings, we may not be able to meet the demand from our agents or their customers, which could lead to a loss of customers, agents or both.\nWe may not be able to grow as quickly or as profitably as we intend, which is important to our current strategy.\nOver the past several years, we have made, and our current plans are to continue to make, significant investments in our Commercial and Personal Lines of business, in order to, among other things, strengthen our product offerings and service capabilities, expand into new geographic areas, improve technology and our operating models, build expertise in our personnel, and expand our distribution capabilities, with the ultimate goal of achieving significant, sustained growth. The ability to achieve significant profitable premium growth in order to earn adequate returns on such investments and expenses, and to grow further without proportionate increases in expenses, is an important part of our current strategy. There can be no assurance that we will be successful at profitably growing our business, or that we will not alter our current strategy due to changes in our markets or an inability to successfully maintain acceptable margins on new or existing business or for other reasons, including general economic conditions as a result of the Pandemic or otherwise, in which case premiums written and earned, operating income and net book value could be adversely affected.\nWe may be affected by disruptions caused by the introduction of new products, related technology changes, and new operating models in Commercial Lines, Personal Lines and specialty businesses and future acquisitions, and expansion into new geographic areas.\nThere are increased underwriting risks associated with premium growth and the introduction of new products or programs in our Commercial Lines, Personal Lines and specialty businesses. Additionally, there are increased underwriting risks associated with the appointment of new agencies and managing general agencies and with the expansion into new geographical areas.\nThe introduction of new Commercial Lines products and the development of new niche and specialty lines presents new risks. Certain new specialty products may present longer \u201ctail\u201d risks and increased volatility in profitability. Our expansion into western states, including California, presents additional underwriting risks since the regulatory, geographic, natural risk, legal environment, demographic, business, economic and other characteristics of these states present challenges different from those in the states where we historically have conducted business. In addition, our agency relationships in these new geographies are not as developed.\nOur Personal Lines production and earnings may be unfavorably affected by the continued introduction of new products, expanded risk appetites and our focus on account business (i.e., policyholders who have both automobile and homeowner insurance with us) that we believe, despite pricing discounts, will ultimately be more profitable business. We may also experience adverse selection, which occurs when insureds purchase our products because of under-pricing, operational difficulties or implementation impediments with independent agents or the inability to grow new markets after the introduction of new products or the appointment of new agents.\nAs we enter new states or regions or grow our business, there can be no assurance that we will not experience higher loss trends than anticipated.\nRisks Related to Technology, Data Security and Privacy\nWe may experience difficulties with technology, implementing new technologies, data security and/or outsourcing relationships, which could have a negative impact on our ability to conduct our business.\nWe use computer systems to store, retrieve, evaluate and utilize customer and company data and information. Our computer, information technology and telecommunications systems, in turn, interface with and rely upon third-party systems, including cloud-based data storage. Our business is highly dependent on our ability and the ability of certain third parties, to access these systems to perform necessary business functions, including, without limitation, providing insurance quotes, processing premium payments, making changes to existing policies, filing and paying claims, providing customer support and managing investment portfolios. Systems attacks, failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform these functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business and hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers. In the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a blackout, a computer virus, a cyber security attack or intrusion, a terrorist attack or war, or interference from solar flares, our systems or the external systems that we rely on may be inaccessible to our employees, customers or business partners for an extended period of time. Even if our employees are able to report to work, they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or the systems that we rely on are disabled or destroyed or if our disaster recovery plans are inadequate or suffer from unforeseen consequences. This could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results and liquidity.\nWe increasingly rely on technological and data-driven solutions to operate our business. If we are slow to adapt to, roll out or implement new technologies, particularly those that leverage data and analytics, it could materially affect our ability to meet the expectations of our customers or compete with more technologically adept competitors, particularly those with greater resources to devote to new technologies or technological enhancements.\nIn addition, we outsource certain technology and business process functions and data storage to third parties and may do so increasingly in the future. If we do not effectively develop, implement and monitor our outsourcing strategies, third-party providers do not perform as anticipated or we or they experience technological or other problems with a transition or in operations, we may not realize productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience operational difficulties, liabilities for breaches of confidential information, increased costs and a loss of business. Our outsourcing of certain technology, data storage and business process functions to third parties may expose us to enhanced risk related to data security, which could result in monetary and reputational damages. In addition, our ability to receive services from third-party providers outside of the United States might be impacted by cultural differences, political instability, regulatory requirements or policies inside or outside of the United States. As a result, our ability to conduct our business might be adversely affected.\nData security incidents, including, but not limited to, those resulting from a malicious cyber security attack on us or our business partners and service providers, or intrusions into our systems or data sources could disrupt or otherwise negatively impact our business.\nOur systems and the systems that we rely on, like others in the financial services industry, are vulnerable to cyber security risks, and we are subject to disruption and other adverse effects caused by such activities. Large corporations such as ours are subject to daily attacks on their systems and other vulnerabilities to data security incidents. These attacks and incidents have included, or may in the future include: unauthorized access, viruses, malware or other malicious code, ransomware, deceptive social engineering campaigns (also known as \u201cphishing\u201d or \u201cspoofing\u201d), loss or theft of assets, employee errors or malfeasance, third-party errors or malfeasance, as well as system failures and other security events. Such attacks may have various goals, from seeking confidential information or the misdirection of payments, to causing operational disruption. Such activities could result in material disruptions to our operations, financial loss or material damage to our reputation. Like other companies, we have from time to time experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, security events and data intrusion, and while none of these events to date have had a material adverse effect on our business, no assurances can be made that such attacks or security events will not have a material adverse effect on our business in the future. As the breadth and complexity of cyber security attacks and other data security events become more prevalent and the methods used to perpetrate them evolve, we may be required to devote additional personnel, or financial or systems resources, to protecting our data security or investigating or remediating vulnerabilities as a result of data security incidents. Such resources could be costly in time and expenses, and could detract from resources spent on our core property and casualty insurance operations. In addition, we may not be able to detect an incident, assess its severity or impact, or appropriately respond in a timely manner, which could increase our exposure to an incident.\nThe third parties with whom we work are also subject to these same risks, and we are vulnerable if a cyber security attack or other data security incident involves a third-party vendor or service provider. Such an event could threaten to disrupt our business if the third party\u2019s operations are compromised, or provide attackers an avenue to pivot and attack our systems by exploiting the relationships that we have with our trusted business partners. While we take measures to protect against such events (e.g., utilizing secure transmission capabilities with third-party vendors and others with whom we do business when possible), review and assess our third-party providers\u2019 cybersecurity controls, as appropriate, and make changes to our business processes to manage these risks, we cannot assure that our efforts will always be successful.\nAny failure to protect the confidentiality of customer information could adversely affect our reputation or expose us to fines, penalties or litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are required to safeguard the confidential personal information of our customers and applicants and are subject to an increasing number of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations regarding privacy and data security, as well as contractual commitments. These laws and regulations are rapidly evolving, complex, vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and sometimes conflict. In the absence of updated, uniform federal privacy legislation, there is a growing trend in the states in which we operate, to adopt comprehensive privacy legislation that provides consumers with various privacy rights and imposes significant compliance burdens on covered companies. Failure to comply with any privacy laws or regulations could subject us to governmental enforcement actions and fines, penalties, litigation, private rights of action or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others if confidential customer information is misappropriated from our computer systems, those of our vendors or others with whom we do business, or otherwise. Despite the security measures that may be in place, any such systems may be vulnerable to the types of attacks and security incidents described above. Any well-publicized compromise of security could deter people from entering into transactions that involve transmitting confidential information, impart reputational or other harm and/or have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, privacy legislation may make our business partners more reluctant to share information with us that is useful in conducting our business.\nRisks Related to Competition and Competitors in the Property and Casualty Insurance Market\nIntense competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability, particularly in light of the various competitive, financial, strategic, technological, structural, informational and resource advantages that our competitors have.\nWe compete, and will continue to compete, with a large number of companies, including international, national and regional insurers, specialty insurance companies, underwriting agencies and financial services institutions. We also compete with mutual insurance companies, reciprocal and exchange companies that may not have shareholders and may have different profitability targets than publicly or privately owned companies. In recent years, there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry, resulting in increased competition from large, well-capitalized financial services firms. Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, technological, and operating resources than we do, greater access to data analytics or \u201cbig data\u201d, and may be able to offer a wider range of, or more sophisticated, commercial and personal line products. Some of our competitors also have different marketing, advertising and sales strategies than we do and market and sell their products to consumers directly. In addition, competition in the U.S. property and casualty insurance market has intensified over the past several years. This competition has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability.\nThe industry and we are challenged by changing practices caused by the Internet, application-based programs relying on algorithms and computer modeling to underwrite policies and administer claims, and the increased usage of real time comparative rating tools and claims management processes, which have led to greater competition in the insurance business in general, particularly on the basis of price and pressure to reduce coverages to compete on price and to respond to customer requests as quickly as possible.\nWe also face heightened competition resulting from the entry of new competitors and the introduction of new products by new and existing competitors. Recent entries into the property and casualty marketplace by large technology companies, retail companies, so-called \u201cInsurtech\u201d companies and other non-traditional insurance providers, who aim to leverage their information about technology and direct access to customers, without the burden of legacy systems, access and ability to manipulate \u201cbig data,\u201d artificial intelligence, speed in responding to customer requests or other developing opportunities, may increase competition. Increased competition could make it difficult for us to obtain new or retain existing customers. It could also result in increasing our service, administrative, policy acquisition or general expenses as we seek to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors. In addition, our administrative, technology and management information systems\u2019 expenditures could increase substantially as we try to maintain or improve our competitive position or keep up with evolving technology in order to deliver the same or similar customer or agency experience as those offered by our competitors.\nWe compete for business not just on the basis of price, but also on the basis of product coverages, reputation, financial strength, quality of service (including claims adjustment service), experience and breadth of product offering. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain a competitive position in the markets where we operate, or that we will be able to expand our operations into new markets.\nRisks Related to Financial Strength and Debt Ratings\nWe are rated by several rating agencies, and downgrades to our ratings could adversely affect our operations.\nOur ratings are important in establishing our competitive position and marketing the products of our insurance companies to our agents and customers. Rating information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. Many policyholders, particularly larger commercial customers, will not purchase, and many agents will not distribute, products of insurers that do not meet certain financial strength ratings.\nOur insurance company subsidiaries are rated by A.M. Best, Moody\u2019s, and Standard & Poor\u2019s. These ratings reflect the rating agency\u2019s opinion of our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 financial strength, operating performance, position in the market place, risk management, and ability to meet their obligations to policyholders. These ratings are not evaluations directed to investors, and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. Our ratings are subject to periodic review by the rating agencies, and we cannot guarantee the continued retention or improvement of our current ratings. This is particularly true given that rating agencies may change their criteria or increase capital requirements for various rating levels.\nA downgrade in one or more of our or any of our subsidiaries\u2019 claims-paying ratings could negatively impact our business and competitive position, particularly in lines where customers require us to maintain minimum ratings. Additionally, a downgrade in one or more of our debt ratings could adversely impact our ability to access the capital markets and other sources of funds, increase the cost of current credit facilities, and/or adversely affect pricing of new debt that we may seek in the capital markets in the future. Our ability to raise capital in the equity markets could also be adversely affected.\nNegative changes in our level of statutory surplus could adversely affect our ratings and profitability.\nThe capacity for an insurance company\u2019s growth in premiums is in part a function of its statutory surplus. Maintaining appropriate levels of statutory surplus, as measured by state insurance regulators, is considered important by state insurance regulatory authorities and by rating agencies. As our business grows, or due to other factors, regulators may require that additional capital be retained or contributed to increase the level of statutory surplus. Failure to maintain certain levels of statutory surplus could result in increased regulatory scrutiny, action by state regulatory authorities or a downgrade by private rating agencies. Surplus in our insurance company subsidiaries is affected by, among other things, results of operations and investment gains, losses, impairments, and dividends from each of those companies to its parent company. A number of these factors affecting our level of statutory surplus are, in turn, influenced by factors that are out of our control, including the frequency and severity of catastrophes, changes in policyholder behavior, changes in rating agency models and economic factors, such as changes in equity markets, credit markets or interest rates.\nThe NAIC uses a system for assessing the adequacy of statutory capital for property and casualty insurers. The system, known as risk-based capital, is in addition to the states\u2019 fixed dollar minimum capital and other requirements. The system is based on risk-based formulas that apply prescribed factors to the various risk elements in an insurer\u2019s business and investments to report a minimum capital requirement proportional to the amount of risk assumed by the insurer. Any failure to maintain appropriate levels of statutory surplus would have an adverse impact on our ability to maintain or grow our business.\nRisks Related to Discontinued Operations\nWe could be subject to additional losses related to the sales of our discontinued FAFLIC and variable life insurance and annuity businesses and our former Chaucer business.\nOn January 2, 2009, we sold our remaining life insurance subsidiary, FAFLIC, to Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company (\u201cCommonwealth Annuity\u201d). Coincident with the sale transaction, Hanover Insurance and FAFLIC entered into a reinsurance contract whereby Hanover Insurance assumed FAFLIC\u2019s discontinued accident and health insurance business. We previously owned Commonwealth Annuity, but sold it in 2005 in conjunction with our disposal of our variable life insurance and annuity business. In connection with these transactions, we have agreed to indemnify Commonwealth Annuity for certain contingent liabilities, including litigation and other regulatory matters.\nOn December 28, 2018, we sold the majority of our Chaucer business (specifically our U.K.-based Lloyd\u2019s entities) to China Re, with the rest of the Chaucer sale completed in April 2019. In connection with these transactions, we made certain representations and warranties and agreed to indemnify China Re for certain pre-sale contingent liabilities, including tax and litigation matters.\nWe cannot provide assurance as to what the costs of any indemnifications will be when they ultimately settle.\nWe may incur financial losses related to our discontinued assumed accident and health reinsurance pools and arrangements.\nWe previously participated, through FAFLIC, in approximately 40 assumed accident and health reinsurance pools and arrangements. The business was retained in the sale of FAFLIC and assumed by Hanover Insurance through a reinsurance agreement. In 1999, prior to the sale of FAFLIC to Commonwealth Annuity, FAFLIC had ceased writing new premiums in this business, subject to certain contractual obligations. We are currently monitoring and managing the run-off of our related participation in the 24 pools with remaining liabilities. See \u201cItem 1 - Business - Discontinued Operations,\u201d for information on the processes and risks associated with reserves established for these businesses.\nOur long-term care pool accounts for the majority of our remaining accident and health reinsurance pool business. The potential risk and exposure of our long-term care pool is based upon expected estimated claims and payment patterns, using assumptions for, among other things, morbidity, lapses, future premium rates, the impact of policy inflation protection riders, and the interest rate used for discounting the future projected cash flows. The long-term exposure of this pool depends upon how our actual experience compares with these future cash flow projection assumptions. If any of our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our reserves may be inadequate, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nBased on the information provided by the pool managers, we believe that the reserves recorded related to this business are appropriate. However, due to the inherent volatility in this business and the reporting lag of losses that tend to develop over time and which ultimately affect excess covers, as well as uncertainty surrounding both future claim expenses and with future premium rate levels for certain of these businesses, there can be no assurance that current reserves are adequate or that we will not have additional losses in the future.\nRisks Related to Investments, Capital Markets and Economic Conditions\nOther market fluctuations and general economic, market and political conditions may also negatively affect our business, profitability, investment portfolio, and the market value of our common stock.\nIt is difficult to predict the impact of a challenging economic environment on our business. In Commercial Lines, a difficult economy in the past has resulted in reductions in demand for insurance products and services since there are more companies ceasing to do business and there are fewer business start-ups, particularly as businesses are affected by a decline in overall consumer and business spending. Additionally, claims frequency could increase as policyholders submit and pursue claims more aggressively than in the past, fraud incidences may increase, or we may experience higher incidents of abandoned properties or poorer maintenance, which may also result in more claims activity. We have experienced higher workers\u2019 compensation claims as injured employees take longer to return to work, increased surety losses as construction companies experience financial pressures and higher retroactive premium returns as audit results reflect lower payrolls. Our business could also be affected by an ensuing consolidation of independent insurance agencies. Our ability to increase pricing has been impacted as agents and policyholders have been more price sensitive, customers shop for policies more frequently or aggressively, utilize comparative rating models or, in Personal Lines in particular, turn to direct sales channels rather than independent agents. We have experienced decreased new business premium levels, retention and renewal rates, and renewal premiums. Specifically, in Personal Lines, policyholders may reduce coverages or change deductibles to reduce premiums, experience declining home values, or be subject to increased foreclosures, and policyholders may retain older or less expensive automobiles and purchase or insure fewer ancillary items such as boats, trailers and motor homes for which we provide coverages. Additionally, if as a result of a difficult economic environment, drivers continue to eliminate automobile insurance coverage or to reduce their bodily injury limit, we may be exposed to more uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage losses. Conversely, favorable economic conditions may also impact our business and results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2020, we held approximately $9.0 billion of investment assets in categories such as fixed maturities, equity securities, other investments, and cash and short-term investments. Our investments are primarily concentrated in the domestic market. Our investment returns, and thus our profitability, statutory surplus and shareholders\u2019 equity, may be adversely affected from time to time by conditions affecting our specific investments and, more generally, by bond, stock, real estate and other market fluctuations and general economic, market and political conditions, including the impact of the Pandemic, changing government policies, including monetary policies, and geopolitical risks (which may include the impact of terrorism in various parts of the world or pandemic events). These broader market conditions are out of our control. Our ability to make a profit on insurance products depends in significant part on the returns on investments supporting our obligations under these products, and the value of specific investments may fluctuate substantially depending on the foregoing conditions. We may use a variety of strategies to hedge our exposure to interest and currency rates and other market risks. However, hedging strategies are not always available and carry certain credit risks, and our hedging could be ineffective. Moreover, increased government regulation of certain derivative transactions used to hedge certain market risks has served to prevent (or otherwise substantially increase the cost associated with) hedging such risks.\nAdditionally, the aggregate performance of our investment portfolio depends, to a significant extent, on the ability of our investment managers to select and manage appropriate investments. As a result, we are also exposed to operational and compliance risks, which may include, but are not limited to, a failure to follow our investment guidelines, technological and staffing deficiencies and inadequate disaster recovery plans. The failure of these investment managers to perform their services in a manner consistent with our expectations and investment objectives could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nDebt securities comprise a material portion of our investment portfolio. Although we have an investment strategy that provides for asset diversification, the concentration of our investment portfolio in any one type of investment, industry or geography could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our investment portfolio. The issuers of debt securities, as well as borrowers under the loans we make, customers, trading counterparties, counterparties under swaps and other derivative contracts, banks which have commitments under our various borrowing arrangements, and reinsurers, may be affected by declining market conditions or credit weaknesses. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to lack of liquidity, downturns in the economy or real estate values, operational failure, bankruptcy or other reasons. Future increases in interest rates could result in increased defaults as borrowers are unable to pay the additional borrowing costs on variable rate securities or obtain refinancing. We cannot provide assurance that impairment charges will not be necessary in the future. In addition, evaluation of available-for-sale securities for credit-related impairment losses includes inherent uncertainty and subjective determinations. We cannot be certain that such impairments are adequate as of any stated date. Our ability to fulfill our debt and other obligations could be adversely affected by the default of third parties on their obligations owed to us.\nDeterioration in the global financial markets may adversely affect our investment portfolio and have a related impact on our other comprehensive income, shareholders\u2019 equity and overall investment performance. Recent economic activity has slowed, although growth continues at a moderate rate, and monetary policies in developed economies currently remain accommodative. However, the effects of geo-political developments and conditions in global financial markets could change rapidly in ways that we cannot anticipate, resulting in additional realized and unrealized losses.\nMarket conditions also affect the value of assets under our employee pension plans, including our Cash Balance Plan. The expense or benefit related to our employee pension plans results from several factors, including, but not limited to, changes in the market value of plan assets, interest rates, regulatory requirements or judicial interpretation of benefits. At December 31, 2020, our plan assets included approximately 90% of fixed maturities and 10% of equity securities and other assets. Additionally, our qualified plan assets exceeded liabilities by $27.4 million at December 31, 2020. Declines in the market value of plan assets and lower interest rates from levels at December 31, 2020, among other factors, could impact our funding estimates and negatively affect our results of operations. Deterioration in market conditions, including as a result of the Pandemic, and differences between our assumptions and actual occurrences, and behaviors, could result in a need to fund more into the qualified plans to maintain an appropriate funding level.\nAdditional uncertainties, which could affect our business prospects and investments include the current U.S. political environment, which is characterized by potentially sharp policy differences that may affect all aspects of the economy.\nWe may experience unrealized losses on our investments, especially during a period of heightened volatility, or if assumptions related to our investment valuations are changed, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur investment portfolio and shareholders\u2019 equity can be, and in the past have been, significantly impacted by changes in the market values of our securities. U.S. and global financial markets and economies remain uncertain, particularly in light of the Pandemic. Market uncertainty could result in unrealized and realized losses in future periods, and adversely affect the liquidity of our investments, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and our financial position. Information with respect to interest rate sensitivity is included in \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures\u201d in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis. Valuation of financial instruments (i.e., Level 1, 2, or 3) include methodologies, estimates, assumptions and judgments that are inherently subjective and open to different interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations or the ability to receive such valuations on sale. During periods of market disruption, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. In addition, in times of financial market disruption, certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data may become illiquid. In those cases, the valuation process includes inputs that are less observable and require more subjectivity and judgment by management. Changes in these subjective methodologies, estimates, assumptions and judgments used to value our investments could also materially affect the valuation of certain investments.\nIf, following such declines, we are unable to hold our investment assets until they recover in value, or if such asset value never recovers, we would incur impairment losses that would be recognized as realized losses in our results of operations, reduce net income and earnings per share and adversely affect our liquidity and capital position. Impairment determinations, like valuations, are also subjective, and changes to the methodologies, estimates, assumptions and judgments used to determine impairments may affect the timing and amount of impairment losses recognized in our results of operations. Temporary declines in the market value of fixed maturities are recorded as unrealized losses, which do not affect net income and earnings per share, but reduce other comprehensive income, which is reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We cannot provide assurance that we will not have additional impairment losses and/or unrealized or realized investment losses in the future.\nWe invest a portion of our portfolio in common stock or preferred stocks. The value of these assets fluctuates with the equity markets. Particularly in times of economic weakness, the market value and liquidity of these assets may decline, and may impact net income, capital and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to significant capital market risks related to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, and equity prices, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nWe are exposed to significant capital markets risk related to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, and equity prices. Significant declines in equity prices, changes in interest rates, and changes in credit spreads each could have a material adverse effect on our results, financial position or cash flows. Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates. Our investment portfolio contains interest rate sensitive instruments, such as fixed income securities, which may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates from governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. A rise in market yields would reduce the fair value of our investment portfolio, but provide the opportunity to earn higher rates of return on funds reinvested. A further decline in interest rates, on the other hand, would increase the fair value of our investment portfolio, but we would earn lower rates of return on reinvested assets. We may be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a loss in order to cover liabilities, and such liquidation could be accelerated in the event of significant loss events, such as catastrophes. Although we take measures to manage the economic risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, we may not be able to mitigate the interest rate risk of our assets relative to our liabilities.\nOur investment portfolio is invested primarily in high quality, investment-grade fixed income securities. However, we also invest in non-investment-grade high yield fixed income securities and alternative investments. These securities, which pay a higher rate of interest, also have a higher degree of credit or default risk. These securities may also be less liquid in times of economic weakness or market disruptions. Additionally, reported values of our investments do not necessarily reflect the lowest current market price for the asset, and if we require significant amounts of cash on short notice, we may have difficulty selling our investments in a timely manner, be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize, or both. While we have procedures to monitor the credit risk and liquidity of our invested assets, we expect from time to time, and particularly in periods of economic weakness, to experience default losses in our portfolio. This would result in a corresponding reduction of net income, capital and cash flows.\nInflationary pressures may negatively impact expenses, reserves and the value of investments.\nInflationary pressures in the U.S. with respect to medical and health care, automobile repair and construction costs, as well as social inflation of litigation costs, jury awards and settlement expectations, all of which are significant components of our indemnity liabilities under policies we issue to our customers, and which could also impact the adequacy of reserves we have set aside for prior accident years, may have a negative effect on our results of operations. Inflationary pressures also cause or contribute to, or are the result of, increases in interest rates, which would reduce the fair value of our investment portfolio.\nRisks Related to Capital, Liquidity and Cash Flow\nWe are a holding company and rely on our insurance company subsidiaries for cash flow; we may not be able to receive dividends from our subsidiaries in needed amounts and may be required to provide capital to support their operations.\nWe are a holding company for a group of insurance companies, and our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of these subsidiaries. Our ability to make required interest payments on our debt, as well as our ability to pay operating expenses and pay dividends to shareholders, depends upon the receipt of sufficient funds from our subsidiaries. The payment of dividends by our insurance company subsidiaries is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries, as well as these regulatory restrictions. We are required to notify insurance regulators prior to paying any dividends from our insurance subsidiaries, and pre-approval is required with respect to \u201cextraordinary dividends.\u201d\nBecause of the regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries, we may not always be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in amounts necessary to meet our debt and other obligations, or to pay dividends to our shareholders. The inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us in an amount sufficient to meet our debt interest and funding obligations would have a material adverse effect on us. These regulatory dividend restrictions also impede our ability to transfer cash and other capital resources among our subsidiaries. Similarly, our insurance subsidiaries may require capital from the holding company to support their operations.\nOur dependence on our insurance subsidiaries for cash flow, and their potential need for capital support, exposes us to the risk of changes in their ability to generate sufficient cash inflows from new or existing customers or from increased cash outflows. Cash outflows may result from claims activity, expense payments or investment losses. Because of the nature of our business, claims activity can arise suddenly and in amounts which could outstrip our capital or liquidity resources (particularly in the event of a large catastrophe loss). Reductions in cash flow or capital demands from our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe may require additional capital or credit in the future, which may not be available or only available on unfavorable terms.\nWe monitor our capital adequacy on a regular basis. Our future capital and liquidity requirements depend on many factors, including premiums written, loss reserves and claim payments, investment portfolio composition and risk exposures, the availability of letters and lines of credit, as well as regulatory and rating agency capital requirements. In addition, our capital strength can affect our ratings.\nTo the extent that our existing capital is insufficient or unavailable to fund our future operating requirements and/or cover claim losses, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or limit our growth. Any equity or debt financing, if available, may be on terms that are unfavorable to us. In the case of equity financings, dilution to our shareholders could result and, in any case, such securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges that are senior to our common stock. If we are not able to obtain additional capital as necessary, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the Pandemic\nThe impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and related general economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nThe Pandemic began significantly impacting the U.S. and global financial markets and economies in March 2020. Circumstances relating to the Pandemic are unprecedented in scope and impact, continue to evolve, and are complex and uncertain. We are continually monitoring and assessing the impact of the Pandemic due to such uncertainty and cannot estimate the full extent of its future impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. A prolonged economic downturn or recession as a result of the Pandemic could impact the ability of our insureds to remain solvent, affect their ability to pay premiums or renew their existing\ninsurance policies, or result in customers reducing or eliminating coverages. Prolonged disruptions related to the Pandemic may also affect our agent partners and their ability to operate their businesses and place business with us. Significant agent disruption could also lead consumers to choose our competitors that offer direct-to-consumer or other solutions. These changes may materially and adversely affect our ability to profitably grow our business or maintain our current premium levels, particularly if these conditions exist for a significant amount of time. Decreases in premiums from current levels could result in higher expense ratios. Also, it may be more difficult or costly to obtain reinsurance for certain types of coverages or at retention levels appropriate for our business mix.\nAs a result of the Pandemic and related economic conditions, our investment portfolio has become volatile, impairment losses are higher than experienced in recent years and yields on our fixed income investments have declined. The severity and length of the Pandemic may continue to have a negative impact on our investment portfolio, investment income, liquidity and capital position, of which the impact could be material.\nDue to government-mandated social distancing, public health guidance, lockdown and various stay-at-home and similar orders, the vast majority of our workforce is currently working remotely. The duration of this remote work environment may adversely impact our ability to perform in-person tasks like inspections and investigations for our underwriting and claims functions. Furthermore, if a significant percentage of our workforce is unable to work, whether because of illness, quarantine, limitations on travel or other government restrictions in connection with the Pandemic, or other disruptions, the quality or timeliness of our services and operations may be negatively impacted. Also, with a large percentage of our workforce working remotely, we are highly reliant on the effective functioning of our business continuity plans and technology, and we are subject to ongoing cyber threats and vulnerabilities. We also outsource a variety of functions to third parties, including certain of our administrative operations. As a result, we rely upon the successful ongoing execution of the business continuity plans of such entities in the current environment. While we closely monitor the business continuity activities of these third parties, successful ongoing execution of their business continuity strategies are largely outside our control. If one or more of the third parties to whom we outsource certain critical business activities experience operational impacts, some of which could be significant, from the spread of COVID-19 and governmental reactions thereto or claims that they cannot perform due to a force majeure, it could adversely impact our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nWhile we believe that our in-force Commercial Lines policies in large part do not cover business interruption losses related to the Pandemic, legislation has been discussed and introduced in various states and in the U.S. Congress to retroactively amend insurance contracts to provide business interruption coverage, to impose presumptions on insurance policy interpretation, and/or limit policy exclusions for losses allegedly related to the Pandemic. While we believe that many of those proposals, including retroactive legislation changing the terms of an insurance contract, would be unconstitutional and otherwise violative of well-established law, if such changes were to be enacted and upheld, we would be exposed to a significant unfunded liability. On the Federal level, there is also uncertainty around legislation to address insurance coverages for pandemics prospectively. State regulators may also continue to impose premium refund orders similar to those issued to date that call for premium refunds or credits across multiple lines of business, including both our Commercial and Personal Lines, mandate rate reductions for lines such as personal automobile and commercial automobile coverages due to a decrease in claims frequency as a result of less driving during the Pandemic, and/or mandate additional presumptions of compensability in workers\u2019 compensation coverages. The uncertainties related to these various legislative and regulatory matters, and the potential that other such uncertainties will arise in reaction to the Pandemic, could adversely impact our ability to sustain adequate returns in certain lines of business or in some cases operate lines profitably.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIf we are unable to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel, or if we experience the loss or retirement of key executives or other key employees, particularly those experienced in the property and casualty industry, we may not be able to compete effectively, and our operations could be impacted significantly.\nErrors or omissions, misconduct or fraud in connection with the administration of any of our insurance or investment management operations may cause our business and profitability to be negatively impacted.\nChanges in current accounting practices and future pronouncements may require us to incur considerable additional compliance expenses, to retroactively apply new requirements, or to make financial restatements.\nFailure to design, implement or maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on financial statements, financial reporting, investor confidence, our business and stock price.\nOur stock price is influenced by our financial performance, industry trends and sentiment and other larger macro-economic factors described above in risk factors related to investments, capital markets and economic conditions that are out of our control. These factors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, become volatile, and there is no guarantee that it will remain at or exceed current or historical levels.", "PERMNO": 82292, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "THG"}
