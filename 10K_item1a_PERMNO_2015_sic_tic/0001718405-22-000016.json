RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully review and consider the following risk factors and the other information contained in this 2021 Form 10-K. Investing in our common stock or warrants is speculative and involves a high degree of risk due to the nature of our business and the present stage of exploration and advancement of our mineral properties. We may face additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, which may also impair our business or financial condition. If any of those risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations would suffer. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. See also Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this 2021 Form 10-K. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company\u2019s most recent filings with the SEC.\nSummary of Risk Factors:\nThe following list provides a summary our risk factors discussed in further detail below:\nRisks related to changes in our operations at the Hycroft Mine, including:\n\u2022Risks associated with cessation of mining operations at the Hycroft Mine;\n\u2022Uncertainties concerning estimates of mineral resources;\n\u2022Risks relating to a lack of a completed pre-feasibility or feasibility study; and\n\u2022Risks related to our ability to re-establish commercially feasible mining operations.\nIndustry-related risks including:\n\u2022Fluctuations in the prices of gold and silver;\n\u2022Uncertainties relating to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022The intense competition in the recruitment and retention of qualified employees within the mining industry;\n\u2022The commercial success of, and risks relating to, our development activities;\n\u2022Uncertainties and risks related to our reliance on contractors and consultants;\n\u2022Availability and cost of equipment, supplies, energy, or commodities;\n\u2022The inherently hazardous nature of mining activities, including environmental risks;\n\u2022Potential effects of U.S. federal and state governmental regulations, including environmental regulation and permitting requirements;\n\u2022Uncertainties relating to obtaining or retaining approvals and permits from governmental regulatory authorities;\n\u2022Cost of compliance with current and future government regulations, including environmental regulations;\n\u2022Potential challenges to title in our mineral properties;\n\u2022Our insurance may not be adequate to cover all risks associated with our business;\n\u2022Risks associated with proposed legislation could significantly increase the cost of mine development on our unpatented mining claims;\n\u2022Risks associated with regulations and pending legislation governing issues involving climate change could result in increased costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business; and\n\u2022Changes to the climate and regulations regarding climate change.\nBusiness-related risks including:\n\u2022Risks related to our ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all;\n\u2022The loss of key personnel or our failure to attract and retain personnel;\n\u2022Risks related to our substantial indebtedness, including operating and financial restrictions under existing indebtedness, cross acceleration and our ability to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness;\n\u2022Risks related to having sufficient liquidity to service our indebtedness without a material cash flow;\n\u2022The costs related to our land reclamation requirements;\n\u2022Risks related to technology systems and security breaches;\n\u2022Possible litigation as a result of a failure to remediate a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting; and\n\u2022Risks that our principal stockholders will be able to exert significant influence over matters submitted to stockholders for approval.\nRisks related to our common stock and warrants, including:\n\u2022Volatility in the price of our common stock and warrants;\n\u2022Risks relating to a potential dilution as a result of future equity offerings;\n\u2022Risks relating to a short \"squeeze\" resulting in sudden increases in demand for our common stock;\n\u2022Risks relating to information published by third parties about the Company that may not be reliable or accurate;\n\u2022Risks associated with changes in interest rates;\n\u2022Volatility in the price of our common stock could subject us to securities litigation;\n\u2022Risks associated with our current plan not to pay dividends;\n\u2022Risks associated with future offerings of senior debt or equity securities;\n\u2022Risks related to delisting by Nasdaq;\n\u2022Risks warrants may expire worthless and that certain warrants are being accounted for as a liability;\n\u2022Anti-takeover provisions could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult; and\n\u2022Risks related to limited access to our financial information, as we have elected to take advantage of the disclosure requirement exemptions granted to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies.\nRisks Related to Changes in Hycroft Mine Operations\nWe have mineral resources at the Hycroft Mine but they may not be brought into production.\nWe are not currently conducting commercial mining operations at the Hycroft Mine. There is no certainty that the mineral resources estimated at the Hycroft Mine will be mined or, if mined, processed profitably. We have no specific plans and cannot currently predict when we will be able to bring the Hycroft Mine back into production. The commercial viability of the Hycroft Mine is dependent on a number of factors, including metal prices, the availability of and ability to raise capital for development, government policy and regulation and environmental protection, which are beyond our control. We may not generate commercial-scale revenues until we bring the Hycroft Mine back into production.\nThe figures for our mineral resources are estimates based on interpretation and assumptions and the properties may yield less mineral production or less profit under actual conditions than is currently estimated.\nUnless otherwise indicated, mineral resource figures in our filings with the SEC, press releases and other public statements that may be made from time to time are based upon estimates made by our personnel and independent geologists. These estimates are imprecise and depend upon geologic interpretation and statistical inferences drawn from drilling and sampling analysis, which may prove to be inaccurate. There can be no assurance that mineral resource or other mineralization figures will be accurate or that this mineralization could be mined or processed profitably.\nBecause we have not completed a feasibility study or recommenced commercial production at the Hycroft Mine, mineral resource estimates for our properties may require adjustments or downward revisions based upon further exploration or advancement work or actual production experience. In addition, the grade of ore ultimately mined, if any, may differ from that indicated by drilling results. There can be no assurance that recovery of minerals in small-scale tests will be duplicated in large-scale tests under on-site conditions or in production scale.\nUntil mineral resources are mined and processed, the quantity of ore and grades must be considered as an estimate only. In addition, the quantity of mineral resources may vary depending on metal prices, which largely determine whether mineral\nresources are classified as ore (economic to mine) or waste (uneconomic to mine). Current mineral resource estimates were calculated using sales prices of $1,800 per ounce of gold price and $23.00 per ounce of silver. A material decline in the current price of gold or silver or material changes in our processing methods or cost assumptions could require a reduction in our mineral resource estimates. Any material reductions in estimates of mineral resources, or of our ability to upgrade these mineral resources to mineral reserves and extract these mineral resources, could have a material adverse effect on the our prospects and could restrict our ability to successfully implement our strategies for long-term growth. In addition, we can provide no assurance that gold and silver recoveries experienced in small-scale laboratory tests will be duplicated in larger scale tests under on-site conditions or during production.\nWe have not completed a feasibility study for the proposed processing method for the Hycroft Mine and actual capital costs, operating costs, production and economic returns may differ significantly from those the Company has anticipated. There are no assurances future advancement activities by the Company, if any, will lead to a favorable feasibility study or profitable mining operations.\nWe have completed and issued the 2022 Hycroft TRS with an effective date of February 18, 2022 which was prepared in accordance with the Modernization Rules and which replaced the prior 2019 Hycroft TRS, prepared in accordance with the Modernization Rules. The 2022 Hycroft TRS is an Initial Assessment and is not a feasibility study for the Hycroft Mine. Typically a company will not make a production decision until it has completed a feasibility study. Feasibility studies derive estimates of cash operating costs based upon, among other things:\n\u2022anticipated tonnage, grades and metallurgical characteristics of the mineral reserves to be mined and processed;\n\u2022anticipated recovery rates of gold and other metals from the mineral reserves;\n\u2022cash operating costs of comparable facilities and equipment; and\n\u2022anticipated climatic conditions and environmental protection measures.\nCompleting a feasibility study of the Hycroft Mine will require significant additional work and study in order to reduce the range of uncertainty associated with the study\u2019s estimates and conclusions. Cash operating costs, production and economic returns, and other estimates contained in studies or estimates prepared by or for us may differ significantly from those anticipated by us and estimated costs as they are developed if too high may result in further delays or cancellation of advancement at the Hycroft Mine.\nThere is no certainty that a feasibility study for the Hycroft Mine will be completed or, if completed, that it will result in sufficiently favorable estimates of the economic viability of the Hycroft Mine to justify a construction decision.\nWe may not be able to successfully re-establish mining operations or profitably produce precious metals.\nWe currently have no ongoing commercial mining operations or sustaining revenue from the care and maintenance processing operations currently conducted at the Hycroft Mine. Mineral exploration and advancement involves a high degree of risk and few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. The future advancement of the Hycroft Mine will require obtaining permits and financing and the construction and operation of the mine, processing plants and related infrastructure. Our ability to establish mining operations or profitably produce precious metals from the Hycroft Mine will be affected by:\n\u2022timing and cost, which can be considerable, of the construction of additional mining and processing facilities;\n\u2022availability and costs of skilled labor and mining equipment;\n\u2022availability and cost of appropriate smelting and/or refining arrangements;\n\u2022need to obtain necessary additional environmental and other governmental approvals and permits, and the timing of those approvals and permits;\n\u2022availability of funds to finance equipment purchases, construction and advancement activities;\n\u2022management of an increased workforce and co-ordination of contractors;\n\u2022potential opposition from non-governmental organizations, environmental groups, or local groups which may delay or prevent advancement activities; and\n\u2022potential increases in construction and operating costs due to changes in the cost of fuel, power, labor, materials and supplies and foreign exchange rates.\nIt is common in new mining operations to experience unexpected problems and delays during advancement, construction, start-up commissioning, and transition to commercial operations. In addition, delays in the commencement of mineral production often occur. Accordingly, there are no assurances that, if we decide to initiate construction or mining activities, that we will be able to successfully establish mining operations or profitably produce gold and silver at the Hycroft Mine.\nIndustry-Related Risks\nThe market prices of gold and silver are volatile. A decline in gold and silver prices could result in decreased revenues, decreased net income, increased losses and decreased cash inflows which may negatively affect our business.\nGold and silver are commodities. Their prices fluctuate and are affected by many factors beyond our control, including interest rates, expectations regarding inflation, speculation, currency values, central bank activities, governmental decisions regarding the disposal of precious metals stockpiles, global and regional demand and production, political and economic conditions and other factors. The prices of gold and silver, as quoted by The London Bullion Market Association on March 25, 2022, December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, were $1,954, $1,820 and $1,891 per ounce for gold, respectively, and $25.62, $23.09 and $26.49 per ounce for silver, respectively. The prices of gold and silver may decline in the future. A substantial or extended decline in gold or silver prices would adversely impact our financial position, revenues, net income and cash flows, particularly in light of our current strategy of not engaging in hedging transactions with respect to gold or silver. In addition, sustained lower gold or silver prices may adversely affect our business, including:\n\u2022halt, delay, modify, or cancel plans for the mining of oxide, transitional, and sulfide ores or the development of new and existing projects;\n\u2022reduce existing mineral resources by removing ores from mineral resources that can no longer be economically processed at prevailing prices; and\n\u2022cause us to recognize an impairment to the carrying values of long-lived assets.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and is expected to continue to cause, disruptions in regional economies and the world economy and financial and commodity markets in general. The transmission of COVID-19 and efforts to contain its spread have resulted in international, national and local border closings, travel restrictions, significant disruptions to business operations, supply chains and customer activity and demand, service cancellations, workforce reductions and other changes, significant challenges in healthcare service provision and delivery, mandated closures and quarantines, as well as considerable general concern and uncertainty, all of which have negatively affected the economic environment and may in the future have further and larger impacts. The full extent of the impact of the pandemic on the economy and commodity prices, including gold and silver prices, is not known at this time and it is not known what measures will be implemented by governmental authorities in the future and how long these measures, or the measures currently in effect, will be in place. The COVID-19 global pandemic and efforts to reduce its spread have led to a significant decline of economic activity and significant disruption and volatility in global markets. Additionally, COVID-19 has disrupted the capital markets world-wide and commodity prices, including gold prices, and we may be unable to complete future capital raising transactions if continued concerns relating to COVID-19 cause further significant market disruptions. We cannot at this time predict the duration of the coronavirus pandemic or the impact of government regulations that might be imposed in response of the pandemic; however, the coronavirus pandemic may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face intense competition in the recruitment and retention of qualified employees.\nThe mining industry is intensely competitive for employees and includes several large established mining companies with substantial mining capabilities and with greater financial and technical resources than ours. We compete with other mining companies in the recruitment and retention of qualified managerial and technical employees. If we are unable to successfully attract and retain qualified employees, our development programs and/or our operations may be slowed down or suspended, which may adversely impact our development, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot be certain that our future development activities will be commercially successful.\nSubstantial expenditures are required to construct and operate the Hycroft Mine including additional equipment and infrastructure such as is typically seen in a milling and Acid POX plant to allow for extraction of gold and silver from the sulfide mineral resource, to further develop our Hycroft Mine to establish mineral reserves and identify new mineral resources through drilling and analysis. In 2022, we expect to continue to advance the Acid POX evaluation reflected in the Initial\nAssessment in the 2022 Hycroft TRS. In conjunction with that Initial Assessment, we intend to focus much of our technical efforts for 2022 on, among other things, (1) completing metallurgical testing including bench top autoclave tests and review the results thereof; (2) reviewing historical drilling data in the drillhole database to identify areas of potential underestimated silver and improve where applicable through rerunning available pulps; (3) follow-up on higher grades encountered during the 2021 drill program to improve overall grade of mineral resources; (4) assessing the potential to convert material currently considered waste and upgrade inferred material to a higher resource classification in the designed pits through a drill program and initiate said program. We cannot provide any assurance that an economic process can be developed for the sulfide mineral resource using Acid POX or other similar sulfide extraction processes, that any mineral resources discovered will be in sufficient quantities and grades to justify commercial operations or that the funds required for development can be obtained on a timely or economic basis.\nA number of factors, including costs, actual mineralization, consistency and reliability of ore grades and commodity and reagent quantities and prices affect successful project development. The efficient operation of processing facilities, the existence of competent operational management, as well as the availability and reliability of appropriately skilled and experienced consultants also can affect successful project development. We can provide no assurance that the development and advancement of the Hycroft Mine sulfide processing operations will result in economically viable mining operations.\nOur reliance on third-party contractors and consultants to conduct our exploration and development projects exposes us to risks.\nIn connection with the exploration and development of the Hycroft Mine, we contract and engage third party\ncontractors and consultants to assist with aspects of such projects. As a result, we are subject to a number of risks, some of which are outside our control, including:\n\u2022negotiating agreements with contractors and consultants on acceptable terms;\n\u2022the inability to replace a contractor or consultant and their operating equipment in the event that either party terminates the agreement;\n\u2022reduced control over those aspects of exploration or development operations which are the responsibility of the contractor or consultant;\n\u2022failure of a contractor or consultant to perform under their agreement or disputes relative to their performance;\n\u2022interruption of exploration or development operations or increased costs in the event that a contractor or consultant ceases their business due to insolvency or other unforeseen events;\n\u2022failure of a contractor or consultant to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, to the extent they are responsible for such compliance; and\n\u2022problems of a contractor or consultant with managing their workforce, labor unrest or other employment issues.\nIn addition, we may incur liability to third parties as a result of the actions of our contractors or consultants. The occurrence of one or more of these risks could increase our costs, interrupt or delay our exploration or development activities or our ability to access our ores, and adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial position.\nA shortage of equipment and supplies and/or the time it takes such items to arrive at our Hycroft Mine could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nWe are dependent on various supplies and equipment to engage in exploration and development activities. The shortage of such supplies, equipment and parts and/or the time it takes such items to arrive at our Hycroft Mine could have a material adverse effect on our ability to explore and develop the Hycroft Mine. Such shortages could also result in increased costs and cause delays in exploration and development projects.\nMining development and processing operations pose inherent risks and costs that may negatively impact our business.\nMining development and processing operations involve many hazards and uncertainties, including, among others:\n\u2022metallurgical or other processing problems;\n\u2022ground or slope failures;\n\u2022industrial accidents;\n\u2022unusual and unexpected rock formations or water conditions;\n\u2022environmental contamination or leakage;\n\u2022flooding and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions or other acts of nature;\n\u2022fires;\n\u2022seismic activity;\n\u2022pandemics adversely affecting the availability of workforces and supplies;\n\u2022mechanical equipment failure and facility performance problems; and\n\u2022availability of skilled labor, critical materials, equipment, reagents, and consumable items.\nThese occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of, our properties or production facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, delays in future mining or processing, increased future production costs, asset write downs, monetary losses and legal liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our future development plans and ability to raise additional capital.\nEnvironmental regulations could require us to make significant expenditures or expose us to potential liability.\nTo the extent we become subject to environmental liabilities, the payment of such liabilities or the costs that we may incur, including costs to remedy environmental pollution, would reduce funds otherwise available to us and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. If we are unable to fully remedy an environmental violation or release of hazardous substances, we might be required to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy or corrective action. The environmental standards that may ultimately be imposed at a mine site can vary and may impact the cost of remediation. Actual remedial costs may exceed the financial accruals that have been made for such remediation. Additionally, the timing of the remedial costs may be materially different from the current remediation plan. The potential exposure may be significant and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, governmental authorities and private parties may bring lawsuits based upon damage to property or natural resources and injury to persons resulting from the environmental, health and safety impacts of our past and current operations, which could lead to the imposition of substantial fines, remediation costs, penalties, injunctive relief and other civil and criminal sanctions. Substantial costs and liabilities, including those required to restore the environment after the closure of mines, are inherent in our operations. We cannot provide any assurance that any such law, regulation, enforcement or private claim will not have a negative effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous governmental permits that are difficult to obtain and we may not be able to obtain or renew all of the permits we require, or such permits may not be timely obtained or renewed.\nIn the ordinary course of business we are required to obtain and renew governmental permits for our current limited operations at the Hycroft Mine. We will also need additional governmental permits to accomplish our long-term plans to mine sulfide ores under plans yet to be developed. Obtaining or renewing the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process involving costly undertakings by us. The duration and success of our efforts to obtain and renew permits are contingent upon many variables not within our control, including the interpretation of applicable requirements implemented by the permitting authority and intervention by third parties in any required environmental review. We may not be able to obtain or renew permits that are necessary on a timely basis or at all, and the cost to obtain or renew permits may exceed our estimates. Failure to comply with the terms of our permits may result in injunctions, fines, suspension or revocation of permits and other penalties. We can provide no assurance that we have been, or will at all times be, in full compliance with all of the terms of our permits or that we have all required permits. The costs and delays associated with compliance with these permits and with the permitting process could alter all or a portion of any mine plan we may propose in the future, delay or stop us from proceeding with the development of the Hycroft Mine or increase the costs of development or production, any or all of which may materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nFailure to comply with environmental regulations could result in penalties and costs.\nWhile the Hycroft Mine is not conducting active mining operations, our facilities and prior operations have been and are, and our future development plans may continue to be, subject to extensive federal and state environmental regulation, including those enacted under the following laws:\n\u2022Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act;\n\u2022Resource Conservation and Recovery Act;\n\u2022Clean Air Act;\n\u2022National Environmental Policy Act;\n\u2022Clean Water Act;\n\u2022Safe Drinking Water Act;\n\u2022Federal Land Policy and Land Management Act of 1976; and\n\u2022Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act;\nAdditional regulatory authorities may also have or have had jurisdiction over some of our operations and mining projects including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, BLM, and the Nevada Department of Wildlife.\nThese environmental regulations require us to obtain various permits, approvals and licenses and also impose standards and controls relating to development and production activities. For instance, we are required to hold a Nevada Reclamation Permit with respect to the Hycroft Mine. This permit mandates concurrent and post-mining reclamation of mines and requires the posting of reclamation bonds sufficient to guarantee the cost of mine reclamation. Changes to the amount required to be posted for reclamation bonds could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Also, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to land use and may materially delay or prohibit land access for our development. For example, we had to obtain certain permits associated with mining in the area of an eagle habitat. Failure to obtain such required permits or failure to comply with federal and state regulations could also result in delays in beginning or expanding exploration, future operations, incurring additional costs for investigation or cleanup of hazardous substances, payment of penalties for non-compliance or discharge of pollutants, and post-mining closure, reclamation and bonding, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance, results of operations and liquidity.\nCompliance with current and future government regulations may cause us to incur significant costs.\nMining operations are subject to extensive federal and state legislation governing matters such as mine safety, occupational health, labor standards, prospecting, exploration, production, exports, toxic and hazardous substances, explosives, management of natural resources, land use, water use, air emissions, waste disposal, environmental review and taxes. While we have ceased operations at the Hycroft Mine, continued compliance with these regulations and other legislation relating to our obligations with respect to the Hycroft Mine and its future development could require us to make significant financial outlays to comply with these laws. The enactment of new legislation or more stringent enforcement of current legislation may also increase these costs, which could have a negative effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to adapt to these regulatory developments on a timely or cost-effective basis. Violations of these laws, regulations and other regulatory requirements could lead to substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions, including possible shutdown of future operations, as applicable.\nThere are uncertainties as to title matters in the mining industry. Any defects in such title could cause us to lose our rights in mineral properties and jeopardize our business.\nOur mineral properties consist of private mineral rights, leases covering private lands, leases of patented mining claims and unpatented mining claims. Areas of the Hycroft Mine are unpatented mining claims located on lands administered by the BLM Nevada State office to which we have only possessory title. Because title to unpatented mining claims is subject to inherent uncertainties, it is difficult to determine conclusively ownership of such claims. These uncertainties relate to such things as sufficiency of mineral discovery, proper location and posting and marking of boundaries, and possible conflicts with other claims not determinable from descriptions of record. We believe a substantial portion of all mineral exploration, development and mining in the United States now occurs on unpatented mining claims, and this uncertainty is inherent in the mining industry.\nThe present status of our unpatented mining claims located on public lands allows us the right to mine and remove valuable minerals, such as precious and base metals, from the claims conditioned upon applicable environmental reviews and permitting programs. We also are generally allowed to use the surface of the land solely for purposes related to mining and processing the mineral-bearing ores. However, legal ownership of the land remains with the United States. We remain at risk that the mining claims may be forfeited either to the United States or to rival private claimants due to failure to comply with statutory requirements. Prior to 1994, a mining claim locator who was able to prove the discovery of valuable, locatable minerals on a mining claim, and to meet all other applicable federal and state requirements and procedures pertaining to the location and\nmaintenance of federal unpatented mining claims, had the right to prosecute a patent application to secure fee title to the mining claim from the Federal government. The right to pursue a patent, however, has been subject to a moratorium since October 1994, through federal legislation restricting the BLM from accepting any new mineral patent applications. If we do not obtain fee title to our unpatented mining claims, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain compensation in connection with the forfeiture of such claims.\nThere may be challenges to title to the mineral properties in which we hold a material interest. If there are title defects with respect to any properties, we might be required to compensate other persons or perhaps reduce our interest in the affected property. Also, in any such case, the investigation and resolution of title issues would divert our management\u2019s time from ongoing business operations.\nOur insurance may not cover all of the risks associated with our business.\nThe mining business is subject to risks and hazards, including, but not limited to, environmental hazards, industrial accidents, the encountering of unusual or unexpected geological formations, slide-ins, flooding, earthquakes and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions. These occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties, equipment or facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, asset write-downs, monetary losses and possible legal liability. Insurance fully covering many of these risks is not generally available to us and if it is, we may elect not to obtain it because of the high premium costs or commercial impracticality. Any liabilities incurred for these risks and hazards could be significant and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nLegislation has been proposed periodically that could, if enacted, significantly affect the cost of mine development on our unpatented mining claims.\nMembers of the U.S. Congress have periodically introduced bills which would supplant or alter the provisions of the Mining Law of 1872. Such bills have proposed, among other things, to either eliminate or greatly limit the right to a mineral patent and to impose a federal royalty on production from unpatented mining claims. Such proposed legislation could change the cost of holding unpatented mining claims and could significantly impact our ability to develop mineralized material on unpatented mining claims. A majority of our mining claims are unpatented claims. Although we cannot predict what legislated royalties might be, the enactment of these proposed bills could adversely affect the potential for development of our unpatented mining claims and the economics of any future mine operations on federal unpatented mining claims. Passage of such legislation could adversely affect our financial performance and results of operations.\nRegulations and pending legislation governing issues involving climate change could result in increased operating costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to various climate change interest groups and the potential impact of climate change. Legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change could materially increase our costs, and the costs of our suppliers, for further exploration and development of the Hycroft Mine, including costs related to increased energy requirements, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations. Any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such regulations. Given the emotion, political significance and uncertainty around the impact of climate change and how it should be dealt with, we cannot predict how legislation and regulation will affect our financial condition, operating performance and ability to compete. Furthermore, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by us or other companies in our industry could harm our reputation.\nClimate change could have an adverse impact on our cost of operations.\nThe potential physical impacts of climate change on our development activities or future operations are highly uncertain and would be particular to the area in which we operate. These climate changes may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages and changing temperatures. These changes in climate could adversely affect our mining operations, including by affecting the moisture levels and pH of ore on our leach pads, could materially and adversely affect the cost to construct and operate the Hycroft Mine and materially and adversely affect the financial performance of our operations.\nBusiness-Related Risks\nWe will need to raise additional capital, but such capital may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nThe exploration and development of our Hycroft Mine for mining and processing our mineral resources will require significant investment. Failure to obtain sufficient financing may result in the delay or indefinite postponement of exploration, development or production at the Hycroft Mine. The covenants in the Sprott Credit Agreement could significantly limit our ability to secure new or additional credit facilities, increase our cost of borrowing, and make it difficult or impossible to raise additional capital on favorable terms or at all.\nOur primary future cash requirements for 2022 will be to fund working capital needs, capital and project expenditures, satisfying debt service required under the Sprott Credit Agreement, and other corporate expenses so that we can continue to develop the Hycroft Mine by conducting targeted exploration and completing the necessary technical studies to determine the likely timeline to bring the sulfide mineral resources into commercial scale operation. As of December 31, 2021 we had cash of $12.3 million and we have since raised approximately $194.4 million in gross proceeds from a private placement of our equity securities and from an \"at-the-market\" public equity offering of our common stock. You are cautioned that management\u2019s expectations regarding our liquidity and capital resources are based on a number of assumptions that we believe are reasonable but could prove to be incorrect. For example, our expectations are based on assumptions regarding commodity prices, gold and silver recovery percentages and rates, production estimates, anticipated costs and other factors that are subject to a number of risks, many of which are beyond our control. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, we may require additional financing sooner than we expect to continue to operate our business, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all and which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nIf we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel, we may be unable to develop our business.\nOur development in the future will be highly dependent on the efforts of key management employees, specifically, Diane Garrett, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Stanton Rideout, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and other key employees that we may hire in the future. We will need to recruit and retain other qualified managerial and technical employees to build and maintain our operations. If we are unable to successfully recruit and retain such persons, our development and growth could be significantly curtailed.\nThe Sprott Credit Agreement imposes significant operating and financial restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business.\nThe Sprott Credit Agreement imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our restricted subsidiaries. These restrictions limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, as applicable:\n\u2022incur additional debt;\n\u2022pay dividends or make other restricted payments, including certain investments;\n\u2022create or permit certain liens;\n\u2022sell assets;\n\u2022engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022consolidate or merge with or into other companies, or transfer all or substantially all of our assets or the assets of our restricted subsidiaries.\nThese restrictions could limit our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs, make acquisitions or pursue available business opportunities.\nIn addition, the Sprott Credit Agreement requires us to comply with a number of customary covenants, including:\n\u2022covenants related to the delivery of monthly, quarterly and annual consolidated financial statements, budgets and annual projections;\n\u2022maintaining required insurance;\n\u2022compliance with laws (including environmental);\n\u2022compliance with ERISA;\n\u2022maintenance of ownership of 100% of Hycroft Mine;\n\u2022restrictions on consolidations, mergers or sales of assets;\n\u2022limitations on liens;\n\u2022limitations on issuance of certain equity interests;\n\u2022limitations on issuance of additional indebtedness;\n\u2022limitations on transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022other customary covenants.\nWe have received several waivers to date from covenant obligations under the Sprott Credit Agreement. We cannot assure you that we will satisfy these covenants or that our lenders will continue to waive any future failure to do so. A breach of any of the covenants under the Sprott Credit Agreement could result in a default. See Note 10 - Debt, Net and Note 25 - Subsequent Events to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. If a default occurs under the Sprott Credit Agreement and/or the Royalty Agreement among the Company, our wholly owned subsidiary Hycroft Resources and Development, LLC and Sprott Private Resource Lending II (CO) Inc., (the \u201cSprott Royalty Agreement\u201d), the lenders could elect to declare the debt, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable and proceed against the collateral securing that debt, which, in the case of the Sprott Credit Agreement and the Sprott Royalty Agreement, constitutes all or substantially all of our assets.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had substantial outstanding indebtedness under the Sprott Credit Agreement and the Subordinated Notes. Subject to the limits and terms contained in the Sprott Credit Agreement, if we are able to incur additional debt or grant additional security interests from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes, then the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify. Our high level of debt and royalty payment obligations could:\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding debt;\n\u2022require a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service and/or royalty payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to commodity price volatility, including increases in prices of commodities that we purchase and decreases in prices of gold and silver that we sell, each as part of our operations, general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;\n\u2022place us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022increase our cost of borrowing.\nAny of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt, and the price of our common stock. The Sprott Credit Agreement contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of nearly all of our debt.\nIf we default on our obligations to pay any of our indebtedness or otherwise default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, lenders could accelerate such debt and we may be subject to restrictions on the payment of our other debt obligations or cause a cross-acceleration.\nAny default under the agreements governing our indebtedness that is not waived by the required lenders or holders of such indebtedness, and the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness, could prevent us from paying principal, premium, if any, and interest on other debt instruments. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness and royalty payment obligations, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants in any agreement governing our indebtedness, we\nwould be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness and other indebtedness under the cross- default and cross-acceleration provisions of such agreements. In the event of such default:\n\u2022the lenders or holders of such indebtedness could elect to terminate any commitments thereunder, declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable and, if not promptly paid, in the case of our secured debt, institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets; and\n\u2022even if these lenders or holders do not declare a default, they may be able to cause all of our available cash to be used to repay indebtedness owed to them.\nAs a result of such default and any actions the lenders may take in response thereto, we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nWe may not have sufficient cash or we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our outstanding indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on our debt and royalty obligations or refinance our debt obligations (if necessary) depends on our financial condition, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control, including the market prices of gold and silver. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flow sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness and our royalty obligations.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations and our royalty obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The Sprott Credit Agreement restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service and royalty payment obligations then due.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt and royalty obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and the lenders under the Sprott Credit Agreement and the Sprott Royalty Agreement could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nLand reclamation requirements for the Hycroft Mine may be burdensome and expensive and include requirements that we provide financial assurance supporting those requirements.\nLand reclamation requirements are generally imposed on companies with mining operations in order to minimize long-term effects of land disturbance. Reclamation may include requirements to control dispersion of potentially deleterious effluents, treat ground and surface water to drinking water standards, and reasonably re-establish pre-disturbance landforms and vegetation.\nIn order to carry out reclamation obligations imposed on us in connection with our activities, we must allocate financial resources that might otherwise be spent on further development programs. We have established a provision for our reclamation obligations on the Hycroft Mine property, as appropriate, but this provision may not be adequate. If we are required to carry out unanticipated reclamation work, our financial position could be adversely affected.\nWe are also required by U.S. federal and state laws and regulations to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved reclamation plans for the Hycroft Mine if we are unable to do so. Third party financial assurances may not be available to us or we may elect not to obtain it because of the high costs, associated collateral requirements may be too expensive or it may be commercially impractical which could adversely affect our financial position.\nWe are dependent upon information technology systems that are subject to disruption, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation and integration.\nWe are dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of our operations. Our information technology systems are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity incidents, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, extortion to prevent or the unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. Given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to operational downtimes, operational delays, extortion, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into our operations. System modification failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could, if not successfully implemented, adversely impact the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective which, if not remediated, may result in material misstatements of our consolidated financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations.\nIn connection with the restatement of our consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2020, management concluded there was a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nManagement identified a material weakness in our controls over the accounting for the 5-Year Private Warrants issued in connection with the initial public offering of MUDS and recorded to our consolidated financial statements as a result of the Recapitalization Transaction that was consummated on May 29, 2020. Our controls to evaluate the accounting for complex financial instruments, such as for warrants issued by MUDS, did not operate effectively to appropriately apply the provisions of ASC 815-40. This material weakness resulted in a material error in our accounting for the 5-Year Private Warrants recorded as part of the Recapitalization Transaction and a restatement of our previously issued consolidated financial statements as more fully described in Note 25 - Restatement of Previously Issued Audited Financial Statements to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2020. As a result, Management concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.\nTo remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, management implemented additional review procedures, and additional training and enhancements to the accounting policy related to the accounting for equity and liability instruments (including those with warrants) to determine proper accounting in accordance with GAAP.\nAlthough our remediation plan has been implemented and completed as of the filing date of this 2021 Form 10-K, the material weakness cannot be considered remediated until the controls operate for a sufficient period and management has concluded, through testing, that our internal controls are operating effectively. While management believes that the remedial efforts will resolve the identified material weakness, there is no assurance that management\u2019s remedial efforts conducted to date will be sufficient or that additional remedial actions will not be necessary. In addition, there can be no assurance that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future. If we are unsuccessful in remediating our existing or any future material weaknesses or other deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting and disclosures and our business, reputation, results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, ability to access the capital markets, perceptions of our creditworthiness, and stock price could be adversely affected. In addition, we may be unable to maintain or regain compliance with applicable securities laws or stock market listing requirements.\nIn addition, there can be no assurance that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future. If we are unsuccessful in remediating our existing or any future material weaknesses or other deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting and disclosures and our business, reputation, results of operations, liquidity,\nfinancial condition, ability to access the capital markets, perceptions of our creditworthiness, and stock price could be adversely affected. In addition, we may be unable to maintain or regain compliance with applicable securities laws or stock market listing requirements.\nThe three largest stockholders of the Company are able to exert significant influence over matters submitted to stockholders for approval, which could delay or prevent a change in corporate control or result in the entrenchment of management or the Board of Directors, possibly conflicting with the interests of our other stockholders.\nAs of March 31, 2022, Mudrick Capital Management LP, (\u201cMudrick Capital\u201d), 2176423 Ontario Limited, an entity affiliated with Eric Sprott (\u201cEric Sprott\u201d) and American Multi-Cinema, Inc. (\u201cAMC\u201d) owned approximately 12.4%, 11.9% and 11.9% of our outstanding voting securities, respectively, and have the right to acquire 13,308,529, 23,408,240 and 23,408,240 additional shares of common stock, respectively, upon the exercise of warrants held by them. Because of their significant stockholdings, each of Mudrick Capital, Eric Sprott and AMC could exert significant influence in determining the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval and otherwise influence our business. This influence could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company or entrenching management or the Board of Directors, which could conflict with the interests of other stockholders and, consequently, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nRisks related to our Common Stock and Warrants\nThe market prices and trading volume of shares of our common stock have recently experienced, and may continue to experience, extreme volatility, which could cause purchasers of our common stock to incur substantial losses.\nThe market prices and trading volume of shares of our common stock have recently experienced, and may continue to experience, extreme volatility, which could cause purchasers of our common stock to incur substantial losses. For example, during 2022 to March 29, 2022, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated from an intra-day low of $0.284 per share on March 2, 2022 to an intra-day high of $3.10 on March 29, 2022, and the last recorded sales price of our common stock on Nasdaq on March 29, 2022, was $2.59 per share.\n\u2022During 2022 to March 29, 2022, daily trading volume ranged from approximately 78,900 to 385,302,700 shares. Within the month, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated from an intra-day low of $0.288 on March 3, 2022 to an intra-day high of $3.10 on March 29, 2022.\n\u2022We believe that the recent volatility and our current market prices may reflect market and trading dynamics unrelated to our underlying business, or macro or industry fundamentals, and we do not know how long these dynamics will last. Under the circumstances, we caution you against investing in our common stock, unless you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment.\n\u2022Extreme fluctuations in the market price of our common stock have been accompanied by reports of strong and atypical retail investor interest, including on social media and online forums. The market volatility and trading patterns we have experienced create several risks for investors, including the following:\n\u25e6the market price of our common stock has experienced and may continue to experience rapid and substantial increase or decreases unrelated to our financial performance or prospects, or macro or industry fundamentals, and substantial increases may be significantly inconsistent with the risks and uncertainties that we continue to face;\n\u25e6factors in the public trading market for our common stock include the sentiment of retail investors (including as may be expressed on financial trading and other social media sites and online forums), the direct access by retail investors to broadly available trading platforms, the amount and status of short interest in our securities, access to margin debt, trading in options and other derivatives on our common stock and any related hedging and other trading factors;\n\u25e6our market capitalization, as implied by various trading prices, currently reflects valuations that diverge significantly from those seen prior to recent volatility, and to the extent these valuations reflect trading dynamics unrelated to our financial performance or prospects, purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses if there are declines in market prices driven by a return to earlier valuations; and\n\u25e6to the extent volatility in our common stock is caused, as has widely been reported, by a \u201cshort squeeze\u201d in which coordinated trading activity causes a spike in the market price of our common stock as traders with a short position make market purchases to avoid or to mitigate potential losses, investors purchase at inflated prices unrelated to our financial performance or prospects, and may thereafter suffer substantial losses as prices decline once the level of short-covering purchases has abated.\nThe market price of our shares of common stock and publicly-traded warrants may fluctuate widely.\nThe trading price of our common stock and warrants listed for trading may fluctuate substantially and may be lower than their current prices. The market prices and trading volume of shares of our common stock have recently experienced, and may continue to experience, extreme volatility, which could cause purchasers of our common stock to incur substantial losses. We may continue to incur rapid and substantial increases or decreases in our stock price in the foreseeable future that may not coincide in timing with the disclosure of news or developments by or affecting us. Accordingly, the market price of shares of our common stock may fluctuate dramatically, and may decline rapidly, regardless of any developments in our business. Overall, there are various factors, many of which are beyond our control, that could negatively affect the market price of our common stock or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock, including:\n\u2022publication of research reports by analysts or others about us or the precious metals market, which may be unfavorable, inaccurate, inconsistent or not disseminated on a regular basis;\n\u2022changes in market interest rates that may cause purchasers of shares of our common stock to demand a different yield;\n\u2022changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022market reaction to any additional equity, debt or other securities that we may issue in the future, and which may or may not dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders;\n\u2022actual or anticipated variations in our annual or quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel or Board of Directors members;\n\u2022actions by institutional or significant stockholders;\n\u2022short interest in our stock and the market response to such short interest;\n\u2022the dramatic increase in the number of individual holders of our stock and their participation in social media platforms targeted at speculative investing;\n\u2022speculation in the press or investment community about our company or industry;\n\u2022strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or other investments;\n\u2022the ongoing impacts and developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022legislative, administrative, regulatory or other actions affecting our business, our industry;\n\u2022investigations, proceedings, or litigation that involve or affect us;\n\u2022general market, economic and political conditions, such reductions in precious metals prices, increases in fuel and other commodity prices used in the operation of our business, currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market prices of particular companies\u2019 securities, securities class action litigations have often been instituted against these companies. Litigation of this type, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources. Any adverse determination in any such litigation or any amounts paid to settle any such actual or threatened litigation could require that we make significant payments.\nYou may experience dilution as a result of future equity offerings.\nOn March 14, 2022, we entered into definitive agreements to issue 46,816,480 Units in a private placement, with each Unit consisting of one share of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share and one warrant to purchase a share of Common Stock. In addition, we conducted an \u201cat-the-market\u201d registered public offering in which we sold 89,553,602 additional shares of our common stock. The private placement and the \"at-the-market' registered public offering substantially increased the number of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. In the future, we may issue additional shares of our common stock to raise cash to bolster our liquidity, to pay indebtedness, for working capital, to finance strategic initiatives and future acquisitions or for other purposes. We may also issue securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, shares of our common stock. We may also acquire interests in other companies or other assets by\nusing a combination of cash and shares of our common stock or just shares of our common stock. We may sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is less than the prices per share paid by investors, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible into, exercisable or exchangeable for shares of our common stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the prices per share paid by investors. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock, or both. Any of these events may dilute the ownership interests of current stockholders, reduce our earnings per share or have an adverse effect on the price of shares of our common stock. Further, sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nA \u201cshort squeeze\u201d due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of our common stock that largely exceeds supply and/or focused investor trading in anticipation of a potential short squeeze have led to, may be currently leading to, and could again lead to, extreme price volatility in shares of our common stock.\nInvestors may purchase shares of our common stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our common stock. Speculation on the price of our common stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our common stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our common stock for delivery to lenders of our common stock. Those repurchases may, in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our common stock until additional shares of our common stock are available for trading or borrowing. This is often referred to as a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d With the recent substantial increase in volume of our shares being traded and trading price, the proportion of our common stock that may be traded in the future by short sellers may increase the likelihood that our common stock will be the target of a short squeeze, and there is wide spread speculation that our current trading price is the result of a short squeeze. A short squeeze and/or focused investor trading in anticipation of a short squeeze have led to, may be currently leading to, and could again lead to volatile price movements in shares of our common stock that may be unrelated or disproportionate to our financial performance or prospects and, once investors purchase the shares of our common stock necessary to cover their short positions, or if investors no longer believe a short squeeze is viable, the price of our common stock may rapidly decline. Investors that purchase shares of our common stock during a short squeeze may lose a significant portion of their investment. Under the circumstances, we caution you against investing in our common stock, unless you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment.\nInformation available in public media that is published by third parties, including blogs, articles, online forums, message boards and social and other media may include statements not attributable to the Company and may not be reliable or accurate.\nWe have received, and may continue to receive, a high degree of media coverage that is published or otherwise disseminated by third parties, including blogs, articles, online forums, message boards and social and other media. This includes coverage that is not attributable to statements made by our directors, officers or employees. You should read carefully, evaluate and rely only on the information contained in documents filed with the SEC in determining whether to purchase shares of our common stock. Information provided by third parties may not be reliable or accurate and could materially impact the trading price of our common stock which could cause losses to your investments.\nIncreases in market interest rates may cause potential investors to seek higher returns and therefore reduce demand for our common stock, which could result in a decline in our stock price.\nOne of the factors that may influence the price of our common stock is the return on our common stock (i.e., the amount of distributions as a percentage of the price of our common stock) relative to market interest rates. An increase in market interest rates, which are currently at low levels relative to historical rates, may lead prospective purchasers of our common stock to expect a return, which we may be unable or choose not to provide. Further, higher interest rates would likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease the cash available. Thus, higher market interest rates could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nVolatility in the price of our common stock may subject us to securities litigation.\nAs discussed above, the market for our common stock has been characterized recently by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers, and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe currently plan to invest all available funds and future cash flows, if any, in the development and growth of our business. We have never paid dividends on our common stock and currently have no plans to do so. Our debt agreements contain provisions that restrict our ability to pay dividends. As a result, a rise in the market price of our common stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable, will be your sole source of potential gain in the foreseeable future and you should not rely on an investment in our common stock for dividend income.\nFuture offerings of debt, which would be senior to our common stock upon liquidation, and/or preferred equity securities, which may be senior to our common stock for purposes of distributions or upon liquidation, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making additional offerings of debt or preferred equity securities, including convertible or non-convertible senior or subordinated notes, convertible or non-convertible preferred stock, medium-term notes and trust preferred securities. Upon liquidation, holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive distributions of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. In addition, any preferred stock we may issue could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on distribution payments that could limit our ability to make a distribution to the holders of our common stock. Since our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock.\nWe may receive a delisting notice from the Nasdaq Stock Market and our common stock and warrants could be delisted from trading unless our common stock price trades above $1.00 per share.\nOn December 29, 2021, we received a written notice from the Listing Qualifications department of The Nasdaq Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) indicating that we were not in compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \"Listing Rule) for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. On March 24, 2022, Nasdaq informed us that we had resolved our deficiency and regained compliance with this rule. We can provide no assurance that the trading price of our common stock will not fall below $1.00 per share for a period of 30 consecutive trading days and that we will not receive another notice that we were not in compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market or that we will be able to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, even if we maintain compliance with the other listing requirements.\nThere is no guarantee that our outstanding public warrants will ever be in the money, and they may expire worthless.\nWe have 34,289,898 publicly traded warrants outstanding that entitle holders to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share for a period of five years from the Recapitalization Transaction. On October 6, 2020, we issued 9,583,334 units in an underwritten public offering at an offering price to of $9.00 per unit, with each unit consisting of one share of our common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of $10.50 per share.\nAdditionally, we assumed the obligations and liabilities under that certain warrant agreement, dated as of October 22, 2015, by and between Seller and Computershare Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its wholly owned subsidiary Computershare Trust Company, N.A., a federally chartered trust company, collectively as initial warrant agent; and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC was named as the successor warrant agent (the \u201cSeller Warrant Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the assumption of the Seller Warrant Agreement, the warrants issued thereunder (the \u201cSeller Warrants\u201d) became exercisable into shares of our common stock. The Seller Warrants will expire by the terms on October 22, 2022. As of March 14, 2022, the exercise price for the Seller Warrants was $40.31 per share of our common stock.\nThere is no guarantee that any or all of the public warrants will ever be in the money prior to their expiration, and as such, the warrants may expire worthless.\nOur 5-Year Private Warrants are being accounted for as a warrant liability and are being recorded at fair value upon issuance with changes in fair value each period reported in earnings, which could increase the volatility in our net income (loss) and may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition to other securities, warrants to purchase shares of the Company\u2019s common stock were issued in a private placement to the SPAC sponsor and underwriter (the \u201c5 Year Private Warrants\u201d) in the aggregate amount of 7,740,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share on May 29, 2020, and concurrently with the closing of the\nRecapitalization Transaction, as part of a forward purchase unit offering, the Company issued an additional 2,500,000 5-Year Private Warrants to the SPAC sponsor at an exercise price of $11.50 per share.\nWe have determined that the 5-Year Private Warrants are a liability that is marked-to-market with the non-cash fair value adjustments recorded in earnings at each reporting period. Changes in the trading price of our common stock and the fair value of the 5-Year Private Warrants could result in significant volatility in our warrant liability and our net income (loss) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our charter and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur charter contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. We are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together, these provisions may make it more difficult to remove management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. These provisions include:\n\u2022no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022the right of our Board of Directors to appoint a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director in certain circumstances, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies our Board of Directors;\n\u2022a prohibition on stockholders calling a special meeting and the requirement that a meeting of stockholders may only be called by members our Board of Directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022the ability of our Board of Directors to determine whether to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, the directors and officers; and\n\u2022advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our Board of Directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a meeting of stockholders, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to us as such may make our common stock less attractive to our stockholders.\nWe qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, which we refer to as the \u201cJOBS Act.\u201d As such, we have elected to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, including (i) the exemption from the auditor attestation requirements with respect to internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) the exemptions from say-on-pay, say-on-frequency and say-on-golden parachute voting requirements and (iii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they deem important. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following February 12, 2023, the fifth anniversary of the IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of the Company\u2019s prior second fiscal quarter, and (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act as long as we qualify as an emerging growth company. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our consolidated financial statements with another public company which is neither an\nemerging growth company nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nWe are also a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d, and we will remain a smaller reporting company until the fiscal year following the determination that our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is $250 million or more measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenues are $100 million or more during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is $700 million or more measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter. Similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosure and have certain other reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, being required to provide only two years of audited financial statements. Our stockholders may find our common stock less attractive as a result of our status as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and our reliance on the reduced disclosure requirements afforded to these companies.", "PERMNO": 91976, "SIC": 1040, "TIC": "HYMC"}
