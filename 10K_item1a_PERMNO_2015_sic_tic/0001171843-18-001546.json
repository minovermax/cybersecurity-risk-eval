Risk Factors\nSafe Harbor\nWe may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and our reports to stockholders. The safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 protects companies from liability for their forward looking statements if they comply with the requirements of that Act. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements made pursuant to that safe harbor. These forward-looking statements relate to future events or to our future financial performance, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as \u201cmay,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cseek,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cpredict,\u201d \u201cpotential,\u201d \u201ccontinue,\u201d or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements since they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which are, in some cases, beyond our control and which could materially affect actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations, which we describe in more detail in this section titled \u201cRisks,\u201d include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7 failure of the Company, or its joint venture, LipimetiX Development, Inc., to obtain additional funds to continue operations;\n\u00b7 the impact of the terms or conditions of agreements associated with funds obtained to fund operations;\n\u00b7 failure to obtain additional funds required to complete clinical trials and supporting research and production efforts necessary to obtain FDA or comparable foreign agencies approval for product candidates or secure development agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers;\n\u00b7 the impact of using a virtual operating model;\n\u00b7 unfavorable results of product candidate development efforts;\n\u00b7 unfavorable results of pre-clinical or clinical testing;\n\u00b7 delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain FDA or comparable foreign agencies approvals;\n\u00b7 increased regulation by the FDA or comparable foreign agencies;\n\u00b7 the introduction of competitive products;\n\u00b7 impairment of license, patent or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7 failure to successfully implement our drug development strategy for AEM-28 and its analogs;\n\u00b7 failure of the Company\u2019s common stock to continue to be listed on the OTCQB stock market; and\n\u00b7 the impact of present and future joint venture, collaborative or partnering agreements or the lack thereof.\nIf one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary significantly from what we projected. Any forward-looking statement you read in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reflects our current views with respect to future events and is subject to these and other risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to our operations, results of operations, business strategy and liquidity. We assume no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur Annual Reports for the years ending December 31, 2016 and 2015 on Form 10-K were originally filed with the SEC without an opinion of an independent public accountant, as required by current SEC rules and regulations, and as required to be listed on the OTCQB Markets.\nOur current level of funds available for operation led to additional cost cutting, which included the decision to not engage an independent public accountant to audit and express an opinion on our December 31, 2016 or 2015 financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 15, 2017, as required by current SEC rules and regulations, and as required to be listed on the OTCQB Market. Although we filed an Amended Annual Report on Form 10-K/A with the SEC on October 30, 2017, which included the opinion of an independent registered public account on the December 31, 2016 and 2015 financial statements, we cannot currently predict the response to this action by the SEC or the OTCQB Market, nor the effects of their action on the continued financial viability of the Company or the trading of its common stock.\nIn addition, we noted the previously issued June 30, 2017 and March 31, 2017 Form 10-Qs, which were not reviewed by an independent public accountant as of time of filing, included an error related to the classification of the convertible promissory notes payable of $1,000,000 that were presented at March 31, 2017as long-term when they were in fact current and at June 30, 2017 as current when in fact they were long-term. The Company does not intend to amend these previously issued Form 10-Qs for our June 30, 2017 and March 31, 2017 financial statements. At December 31, 2016 the convertible promissory notes payable were presented as long-term as they were in fact long-term at that date.\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company with no revenue generating operations and high investment costs. Therefore, we will require additional funding to realize revenue from any of our JV\u2019s product candidates, and we may never realize any revenue if our JV\u2019s product candidates cannot be commercialized.\nOur current level of funds is not sufficient to support continued research to develop our JV\u2019s product candidates, and will not be sufficient to fund all the research expenses necessary to achieve commercialization of any of our JV\u2019s product candidates. We will require substantial additional capital, and/or a development partner, to complete the clinical trials and supporting research and production efforts necessary to obtain FDA or comparable foreign agencies\u2019 approval, if any, for our JV\u2019s product candidates. We may not receive any revenue from our JV\u2019s product candidates until we receive regulatory approval and begin commercialization of our JV\u2019s product candidates. We cannot predict whether, or when, that might occur.\nOur JV partners have significant rights as minority-interest stockholders of our JV. Although we effectively own a majority of the outstanding shares of our JV\u2019s common stock, on an as-converted basis, the noncontrolling stockholders of the JV have a majority of the JV\u2019s board of directors.\nPursuant to a Stockholders Agreement, as amended, among all the stockholders of our JV, we have agreed that the board of directors of the JV will be composed of three individuals designated by the noncontrolling common stockholders, one individual designated by the Series B-1 Preferred Stock owners, and three individuals designated by us. Consequently, our designees do not control the JV\u2019s board of directors.\nUnder the Stockholders Agreement, the consent of stockholders acting by a majority in interest is required for a broad range of actions, including annual budgets and operational milestones. Because we are the majority stockholder, these consent rights protect our interests in the JV. However, there is a risk that these consent rights may be insufficient to protect our interests or may result in impasses with respect to the JV\u2019s management and operation, the resolution of which might result in actions, agreements or consequences that we might view as suboptimal. There is no assurance that the minority stockholders of the JV will share the same economic, business or legal interests or goals that we have for the JV's business.\nOur business is subject to stringent regulation, and if we do not obtain regulatory approval for our JV's product candidates, we will not be able to generate revenue.\nOur JV\u2019s research, development, pre-clinical and clinical trial activities and the manufacture and marketing of any products that it may successfully develop are subject to an extensive regulatory approval process by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and abroad. The process of obtaining required regulatory approvals for pharmaceutical products is lengthy, expensive and uncertain, and any such regulatory approvals may entail limitations on the indicated usage of a product, which may reduce the product\u2019s market potential.\nNone of our JV's product candidates have been approved for sale. In order to obtain FDA or comparable foreign agency approval to commercialize any product candidate, a New Drug Application (NDA) (or comparable foreign agency form) must be submitted demonstrating, among other things, that the product candidate is safe and effective for use in humans for each target indication. Our JV\u2019s regulatory submissions may be delayed, or we or our JV may cancel plans to make submissions for product candidates for many reasons, including unfavorable results from or delays in preclinical or clinical trials and lack of sufficient available funding.\nIf we experience delays in our JV\u2019s clinical trials, we will incur additional costs and our opportunities to monetize product candidates will be deferred. Delays could occur for many reasons, including the following:\n\u00b7 the FDA or other health regulatory authorities, or institutional review boards, do not approve a clinical study protocol or place a clinical study on hold;\n\u00b7 suitable patients do not enroll in a clinical study in sufficient numbers or at the expected rate, or data is adversely affected by trial conduct or patient drop out;\n\u00b7 patients experience serious adverse events, including adverse side effects of our JV\u2019s product candidates;\n\u00b7 patients in the placebo or untreated control group exhibit greater than expected improvements or fewer than expected adverse events;\n\u00b7 third-party clinical investigators do not perform the clinical studies on the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical study protocol and good clinical practices, or other third-party organizations do not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u00b7 service providers, collaborators or co-sponsors do not adequately perform their obligations in relation to the clinical study or cause the study to be delayed or terminated;\n\u00b7 we experience difficulties in obtaining sufficient quantities of the particular product candidate or any other components needed for pre-clinical testing or clinical trials;\n\u00b7 regulatory inspections of manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us or a co-sponsor to undertake corrective action or suspend the clinical studies;\n\u00b7 the interim results of the clinical study are inconclusive or negative;\n\u00b7 the clinical study, although approved and completed, generates data that is not considered by the FDA or others to be sufficient to demonstrate safety and efficacy;\n\u00b7 changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions affect the conduct of the clinical trial or the interpretation of its result;\n\u00b7 there is a change in the focus of our JV\u2019s development efforts or a re-evaluation of its clinical development strategy; and\n\u00b7 we lack sufficient funds to pay for development costs.\nConsequently, we cannot assure that we or our JV will make submissions to the FDA or comparable foreign agencies in the timeframe that we have planned, or at all, or that our and our JV\u2019s submissions will be approved by the FDA or comparable foreign agencies. Even if regulatory clearance is obtained, post-market evaluation of our JV\u2019s future products, if required, could result in restrictions on a product\u2019s marketing or withdrawal of a product from the market as well as possible civil and criminal sanctions.\nIf our JV\u2019s product candidates do not gain market acceptance or our competitors develop and market products that are more effective than our JV\u2019s product candidates, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated.\nEven if our JV brings one or more products to market, there is no assurance that our JV will be able to successfully manufacture or market the products or that potential customers will buy them. Market acceptance will depend on our ability to demonstrate to physicians and patients the benefits of the future products in terms of safety, efficacy, and convenience, ease of administration and cost effectiveness, as well as on our JV\u2019s ability to continue to develop product candidates to respond to competitive and technological changes. In addition, we believe that market acceptance depends on the effectiveness of our marketing strategy, the pricing of our JV\u2019s future products and the reimbursement policies of government and third-party payors. Physicians may not prescribe our JV\u2019s future products, and patients may determine, for any reason, that our JV\u2019s product is not useful to them. Insurance companies and other third party payors may determine not to reimburse for the cost of the product.\nCompetition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense and is expected to increase. Several biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic laboratories, universities and other research institutions, are involved in research and/or product development for indications targeted for use by AEM-28 or its analogs. Most of our competitors have significantly greater research and development capabilities, experience in obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing, marketing, financial and managerial resources than we have.\nOur competitors may succeed in developing products that are more effective than the ones we have under development or that render our proposed products or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete. In addition, certain of our competitors may achieve product commercialization before we do. If any of our competitors develops a product that is more effective than one that our JV is developing or plans to develop, or is able to obtain FDA or comparable foreign agencies\u2019 approval for commercialization before we do, we may not be able to achieve significant market acceptance for certain of our JV\u2019s products, which would have a material adverse effect on our JV\u2019s business.\nFor a summary of the competitive conditions relating to indications which we are currently considering for AEM-28 and its analogs, see \u201cCompetition\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIf we cannot protect our joint venture\u2019s AEM-28 and its analogs and other patents, or our JV\u2019s intellectual property generally, our JV\u2019s ability to develop and commercialize its future products will be severely limited.\nOur success will depend in part on our joint venture\u2019s ability to maintain and enforce patent protection for AEM-28 and its analogs and each resulting product. Without patent protection, other companies could offer substantially identical products for sale without incurring the sizable discovery, development and licensing costs that our joint venture has incurred. Our JV\u2019s ability to recover these expenditures and realize profits upon the sale of products would then be diminished.\nAEM-28 is patented and patent applications for the AEM-28 analogs have been filed. There have been no successful challenges to the patents. However, if there were to be a challenge to these patents or any of the patents for product candidates, a court may determine that the patents are invalid or unenforceable. Even if the validity or enforceability of a patent is upheld by a court, a court may not prevent alleged infringement on the grounds that such activity is not covered by the patent claims. Any litigation to enforce our JV\u2019s rights to use its or its licensors\u2019 patents will be costly, time consuming and may distract management from other important tasks.\nAs is commonplace in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, we employ, or engage as consultants, individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. To the extent our employees or consultants are involved in research areas which are similar to those areas in which they were involved at their former employers, we may be subject to claims that such employees or consultants and/or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims, which could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and which may have a material adverse effect on us, even if we are successful in defending such claims.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary information. We seek to protect this information, in part, through the use of confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, advisors and others. Nonetheless, we cannot assure that those agreements will provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information and prevent their unauthorized use or disclosure. The risk that other parties may breach confidentiality agreements or that our trade secrets become known or independently discovered by competitors, could adversely affect us by enabling our competitors, who may have greater experience and financial resources, to copy or use our trade secrets and other proprietary information in the advancement of their products, methods or technologies.\nOur success also depends on our JV\u2019s ability to operate and commercialize products without infringing on the patents or proprietary rights of others.\nThird parties may claim that our JV or its licensors or suppliers are infringing their patents or are misappropriating their proprietary information. In the event of a successful claim against our JV or its licensors or suppliers for infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of others, our JV may be required to, among other things:\n\u00b7 pay substantial damages;\n\u00b7 stop using our JV\u2019s technologies;\n\u00b7 stop certain research and development efforts;\n\u00b7 develop non-infringing products or methods; and\n\u00b7 obtain one or more licenses from third parties.\nA license required under any such patents or proprietary rights may not be available to our JV, or may not be available on acceptable terms. If our JV or its licensors or suppliers are sued for infringement, our JV could encounter substantial delays in, or be prohibited from, developing, manufacturing and commercializing its product candidates.\nOur reliance on third party clinical research organizations and other consultants could have a material effect on our JV\u2019s ability to conduct clinical trials and perform research and development. Product development costs to our JV and our JV\u2019s potential collaborators will increase, and our JV\u2019s business may be negatively impacted, if we experience delays in testing or approvals or if our JV needs to perform more or larger clinical trials than planned.\nTo obtain regulatory approvals for new products, our JV must, among other things, initiate and successfully complete multiple clinical trials demonstrating to the satisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory authorities that our JV\u2019s product candidates are sufficiently safe and effective for a particular indication. We currently rely on third party clinical research organizations and other consultants to assist our JV in designing, administering and assessing the results of those trials and to perform research and development with respect to product candidates. In relying on those third parties, we are dependent upon them to timely and accurately perform their services. If third party organizations do not accurately collect and assess the trial data, our JV may discontinue development of viable product candidates or continue allocating resources to the development and marketing of product candidates that are not efficacious. Either outcome could result in significant financial harm to us.\nThe loss of key management and scientific personnel may hinder our JV\u2019s ability to execute our business plan.\nAs a small company our success depends on the continuing contributions of our management team and scientific consultants, and maintaining relationships with the network of medical and academic centers in the United States and centers that conduct our clinical trials. We utilize consultants to perform a variety of administrative, regulatory or research tasks. We have entered into consulting agreements with various former key employees, but there is no assurance that these persons will be available in the future to the extent their services may be needed.\nIf we are not successful in retaining the services of former key employees it could materially adversely affect our business prospects, including our ability to explore partnering or development activities.\nOur joint venture is managed under contract by Benu BioPharma, Inc., which is comprised of two individuals (Dennis I. Goldberg, Ph.D., and Eric M. Morrel, Ph.D.). These individuals are minority stockholders in our JV.\nAlthough there is a services contract with Benu BioPharma, Inc., there is no direct agreement with these individuals for continued services and they are under no legal obligation to remain with Benu BioPharma, Inc. We can give no assurance that all or any of these individuals will continue to provide services to our joint venture. Should any of these individuals not continue to provide services to our joint venture, it could have a material adverse effect on our joint venture\u2019s ability or cost to develop AEM-28 and its analogs.\nPossible side effects of our JV\u2019s product candidates may be serious and life threatening. If one of our JV\u2019s product candidates reveals safety or fundamental efficacy issues in clinical trials, it could adversely impact the development path for our JV\u2019s other current product candidates for that peptide. We face an inherent risk of liability in the event that the use or misuse of our JV\u2019s future products results in personal injury or death.\nThe occurrence of any unacceptable side effects during or after pre-clinical and clinical testing of our JV\u2019s product candidates, or the perception or possibility that our JV\u2019s product candidates cause or could cause such side effects, could delay or prevent approval of our JV\u2019s products and negatively impact its business. The use of our JV\u2019s product candidates in clinical trials may expose us and our JV to product liability claims, which could result in financial losses. Our clinical liability insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover claims that may be made against us or our JV. In addition, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts or scope to protect us and our JV against losses. Any claims against us or our JV, regardless of their merit, could severely harm our financial condition, strain our management and other resources and adversely impact or eliminate the prospects for commercialization of the product which is the subject of any such claim.\nHealthcare reform and restrictions on reimbursements may limit our financial returns.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our products may depend in part on the extent to which government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other third party payors will reimburse consumers for the cost of these products. Third party payors are increasingly challenging both the need for, and the price of, novel therapeutic drugs and uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. Adequate third party reimbursement may not be available for our products to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investments in research and product development, which could restrict our ability to commercialize a particular product candidate.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe trading volume in our common stock is limited and our stock price is volatile, and therefore stockholders may not be able to sell their shares in desired amounts at the reported trading prices.\nThe trading price for our common stock, which is traded in the over-the-counter market, has varied significantly in the past (from a high of $9.32 to a low of $0.04 during the period of January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2017) and may vary in the future due to a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 announcement of the results of, or delays in, preclinical and clinical studies;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u00b7 developments in litigation to which we or a competitor is subject;\n\u00b7 announcements and timing of potential partnering, development collaboration or licensing transactions, merger, acquisitions, divestitures, capital raising activities or issuance of preferred stock;\n\u00b7 announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 FDA and other regulatory actions;\n\u00b7 developments with respect to our or our competitors\u2019 patents or proprietary rights;\n\u00b7 public concern as to the safety of products developed by us or others; and\n\u00b7 changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding us, other drug development companies or the pharmaceutical industry generally.\nOur common stock is thinly-traded, in part because over-the-counter trading volumes are generally significantly lower than those on stock exchanges. The trading volume for our common stock can vary widely from day to day. Because of the low trading volume, a relatively small amount of trading may greatly affect the trading price, the trading price may be subject to amplified decreases upon the occurrence of events affecting our business, and investors should not consider an investment in our common stock to be liquid. In addition, the broader stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies, and these broad market fluctuations may be even more pronounced for our thinly-traded stock.\nFuture share issuances may have dilutive and other material effects on our stockholders.\nWe are authorized to issue 150,000,000 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2017, there were 54,385,411 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. However, the total number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding does not include shares reserved in anticipation of the exercise of options, warrants or additional investment rights. As of December 31, 2017, we had options outstanding to purchase approximately 3,516,706 shares of our common stock, the exercise price of which ranges between $0.05 per share to $1.35 per share, and we have reserved shares of our common stock for issuance in connection with the potential exercise thereof. To the extent additional options are granted and exercised or additional stock is issued, the holders of our common stock will experience further dilution. At December 31, 2017, no shares remain available to grant under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan.\nAs described in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 1, 2018, on January 30, 2018, the Company entered into the First Amendment to Securities Purchase, Loan and Security Agreement (the \u201cAmendment\u201d) with BP Peptides, LLC (\u201cBrookstone\"). Brookstone currently owns approximately 34.1% of our outstanding common stock. Under the original Agreement (see Note 10 to the Financial Statements included in this Annual report on Form 10-K), interest on the Secured Debt was payable quarterly. The Amendment defers the payment of interest until the Secured Debt\u2019s maturity, October 15, 2020. In consideration for the deferral, the Company issued a Warrant to Brookstone to purchase up to 6,321,930 shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock with an exercise price of $.075 per share. The warrant expires October 15, 2025 and provides for quarterly vesting of shares in amounts approximately equal to the amount of quarterly interest payable that would have been payable under the Agreement, converted into shares at $.075. On the date of the Amendment, January 30, 2018, 984,301 shares became fully vested and exercisable.\nIn addition, in the event that any future financing or consideration for a future acquisition should be in the form of, be convertible into or exchangeable for, equity securities, investors will experience additional dilution.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws will make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors(\u201cBoard\u201d) and may discourage takeover attempts that some of our stockholders may consider beneficial.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our Board determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. These provisions include, among other things, the following:\n\u00b7 a classified Board with three-year staggered terms;\n\u00b7 advance notice procedures for stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholders\u2019 meetings;\n\u00b7 the ability of our Board to fill vacancies on the board;\n\u00b7 a prohibition against stockholders taking action by written consent;\n\u00b7 supermajority voting requirements for the stockholders to modify or amend our bylaws and specified provisions of our certificate of incorporation, and\n\u00b7 the ability of our Board to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nThese provisions are not intended to prevent a takeover, but are intended to protect and maximize the value of our stockholders\u2019 interests. While these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of our company to negotiate with our Board, they could enable our Board to prevent a transaction that some, or a majority, of our stockholders might believe to be in their best interests and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits business combinations with interested stockholders. Interested stockholders do not include stockholders whose acquisition of our securities is pre-approved by our Board under Section 203.\nIn April 2017, our Board adopted a Tax Benefit Preservation Plan (\u201cBenefit Plan\u201d) with Computershare, pursuant to which each outstanding share of our common stock has attached one preferred stock purchase right. Each share of our common stock subsequently issued prior to the expiration of the Benefit Plan will likewise have attached one right. Under specified circumstances involving an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d), the right under the Benefit Plan that attaches to each share of our common stock will entitle the holder thereof to purchase 1/100 of a share of our Series A preferred stock for a purchase price of $5.00 (subject to adjustment), and to receive, upon exercise, shares of our common stock having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the right.\nBy adopting the Benefit Plan, our Board sought to protect our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to reduce our future taxable income, if any (collectively, \u201cTax Benefits\u201d). We view our Tax Benefits as highly valuable assets that are likely to inure to our benefit and the benefit of our stockholders if in the future we generate taxable income. However, if we experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d our ability to use the Tax Benefits could be substantially limited, and the timing of the usage of the Tax Benefits could be substantially delayed, which could significantly impair the value of the Tax Benefits. The Benefit Plan is intended to act as a deterrent to persons acquiring our common stock in certain transactions that would constitute or contribute to such an \u201cownership change\u201d without the approval of our Board. The Benefit Plan expires December 31, 2020.\nWe may issue additional shares of preferred stock that have greater rights than our common stock and also have dilutive and anti-takeover effects.\nWe have 2,000,000 shares of authorized preferred stock, the terms of which may be fixed by our Board. We presently have no outstanding shares of preferred stock. Our Board has the authority, without stockholder approval, to create and issue one or more series of such preferred stock and to determine the voting, dividend and other rights of holders of such preferred stock. If we raise additional funds to continue development of AEM-28 and its analogs, or operations, we may issue preferred stock. The issuance of any of such series of preferred stock may have an adverse effect on the holders of common stock.\nWe have not previously paid dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not in the past paid any dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future decision to pay a dividend on our common stock and the amount of any dividend paid, if permitted, will be made at the discretion of our Board.\nThe development of Apo E mimetic peptide molecule AEM-28 and its analogs by our joint venture may not result in a liquidity event or a liquidity event, if one occurs, may be insufficient in size and our investment in LipimetiX Development, Inc. may not be recovered.\nOn August 3, 2012, we entered into a joint venture with LipimetiX, LLC (now LipimetiX Development, Inc.) to develop the Apo E mimetic peptide AEM-28 and its analogs and we contributed $6 million to the joint venture and at December 31, 2017 we have loaned an additional $1,640,000 includes accrued interest of $40,000) to the joint venture. In August 2017, the Company invested an additional $1,000,000 through the purchase of 93,458 shares of series B-2 Preferred Stock of LipimetiX Development, Inc. Our cash investment in and loan to the joint venture represents a substantial proportion of our available cash.\nThe initial funded development plan was focused on the development of treatments using AEM-28 for Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia and Refractory Hypercholesterolemia and extended through Phase 1a and 1b/2a clinical trials, which were completed in the fourth quarter of 2014. Our pre-clinical studies or clinical trials results may not be viewed by potential partners, licensees or acquirers, as successful, and we may not recover our investment. Even if our development efforts are viewed as successful, a liquidity event, if any, may be insufficient in size to recover our investment or loan.\nOur joint venture is unable to continue additional development of AEM or its analogs without additional funding support and the Company does not have sufficient funds to continue either its operations or development funding, which may impair the ability of the joint venture or the Company to continue on a going concern basis.\nThere is no assurance that we will have adequate funds available, or that we can obtain needed funding from third parties on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If the joint venture cannot complete its development work as planned due to a lack of funds, the value of our investment would be impaired, perhaps materially, as would be our ability to continue as a going concern.", "PERMNO": 78836, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "CAPS"}
