{"cik": "1108109", "company": "COMMUNITY HEALTH SYSTEMS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business faces a variety of risks. If any of the events or circumstances described in any of the following risk factors occurs, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected, and our actual results may differ materially from those predicted in any forward-looking statements we make in any public disclosures. Additional factors that could affect our business, results of operations and financial condition are discussed elsewhere in this Report (including in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K). Additional risks or uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our obligations under the agreements relating to our indebtedness.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness, which is more fully described in the Capital Resources section of \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $10.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured indebtedness outstanding, and approximately $6.6 billion of senior unsecured indebtedness outstanding. Our substantial leverage could have important consequences for you, including the following:\n\u2022\nit may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\na substantial portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes, including our operations, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nthe debt service requirements of our indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations;\n\u2022\nsome of our borrowings, including borrowings under our credit facility, accrue interest at variable rates, exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates;\n\u2022\nit may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nwe may be vulnerable in a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business, or we may be unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, including those required for operating our existing hospitals, for integrating our historical acquisitions or for future acquisitions. We also may be forced to sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would be successful and permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements, including our credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding notes. For example, our credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from any dispositions. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions and any proceeds we receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nIn addition, we are a holding company with no direct operations. Our principal assets are the equity interests we hold in our operating subsidiaries. As a result, we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our outstanding debt service and other obligations. Our subsidiaries may not generate sufficient cash from operations to enable us to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness. In addition, any payments of dividends, distributions, loans or advances to us by our subsidiaries are subject to certain legal and contractual restrictions, including under our credit facility and indentures.\nRestrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness may adversely affect us.\nOur credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nissue redeemable stock and preferred stock;\n\u2022\nrepurchase capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake restricted payments, including paying dividends and making certain loans and investments;\n\u2022\nredeem debt that is subordinated in right of payment to our outstanding notes;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nsell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that restrict dividends and certain other payments from subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nmerge, consolidate, sell or otherwise dispose of substantially all our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nguarantee certain obligations.\nIn addition, our credit facility contains restrictive covenants and requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet these restrictive covenants and financial ratios and tests may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet those tests.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding notes. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility or the indentures governing our outstanding notes, all amounts outstanding under our credit facility and our outstanding notes may become immediately due and payable and all commitments under the credit facility to extend further credit may be terminated. The acceleration of any such indebtedness will result in an event of default under all of our other long-term indebtedness.\nDespite current indebtedness levels, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks described above.\nWe and our subsidiaries have the ability to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to restrictions contained in our credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes. Our credit facility as well as a separate receivables facility provide for commitments and borrowings of up to approximately $8.8 billion in the aggregate, of which approximately $7.9 billion is outstanding at December 31, 2015. Our credit facility also gives us the ability to provide for one or more additional tranches of term loans and increases in our revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to the greater of (x) $1.5 billion and (y) an amount such that our senior secured net leverage ratio would not exceed 4.0:1.0 without the consent of the existing lenders if specified criteria are satisfied. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could be further exacerbated.\nFailure to continue to achieve expected benefits of the HMA merger and to continue to integrate HMA\u2019s operations with ours could adversely affect us.\nWe have achieved synergies, and believe that we will achieve additional synergies, from the HMA merger as a result of eliminating duplicate corporate functions and centralizing many support functions. However, we cannot be certain whether, and to what extent, additional efficiencies and cost savings in connection with the HMA merger will continue to be achieved in the future. For example, costs associated with HMA\u2019s legal proceedings and other loss contingencies may be greater than expected, and could exceed the amount of any reduction in payment under the contingent value rights, or CVRs, issued in the HMA merger to HMA stockholders. In addition, in order to continue to obtain the benefits of the merger, we must achieve additional efficiencies through the integration of HMA\u2019s operations. Such integration may be complex and the failure to do so efficiently and effectively may negatively affect earnings.\nWe are the subject of various legal, regulatory and governmental proceedings that, if resolved unfavorably, could have an adverse effect on us, and we may be subject to other loss contingencies, both known and unknown.\nWe are a party to various legal, regulatory and governmental proceedings and other related matters. Those proceedings include, among other things, government investigations. In addition, we are and may become subject to other loss contingencies, both known and unknown, which may relate to past, present and future facts, events, circumstances and occurrences. Should an unfavorable outcome occur in some or all of our legal, regulatory or governmental proceedings or other loss contingencies, or if we become subject to any such loss contingencies in the future, there could be an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nIn particular, government investigations, as well as qui tam lawsuits, may lead to significant fines, penalties, damages payments or other sanctions, including exclusion from government healthcare programs. Settlements of lawsuits involving Medicare and Medicaid issues routinely require both monetary payments and corporate integrity agreements, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nIf competition decreases our ability to acquire additional hospitals on favorable terms, we may be unable to execute our acquisition strategy.\nAn important part of our business strategy is to acquire two to four hospitals each year. However, not-for-profit hospital systems and other for-profit hospital companies generally attempt to acquire the same type of hospitals as we do. LifePoint Hospitals, Inc. is a principal competitor for acquisitions. Other competitors include HCA Holdings, Inc., Universal Health Services, Inc., other non-public, for profit hospitals and local market hospitals. Some of our competition for acquisitions have greater financial resources than we have. Furthermore, some hospitals are sold through an auction process, which may result in higher purchase prices than we believe are reasonable. Therefore, we may not be able to acquire additional hospitals on terms favorable to us.\nIf we fail to improve the operations of acquired hospitals, we may be unable to achieve our growth strategy.\nMany of the hospitals we have acquired had lower operating margins than we do and operating losses incurred prior to the time we acquired them. Future acquired hospitals may have similar financial performance issues. In the past, we have occasionally experienced delays in improving the operating margins or effectively integrating the operations of acquired hospitals. In the future, if we are unable to improve the operating margins of acquired hospitals, operate them profitably, or effectively integrate their operations, we may be unable to achieve our growth strategy.\nIf we acquire hospitals with unknown or contingent liabilities, we could become liable for material obligations.\nHospitals that we have acquired, or in the future could acquire, may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare laws and regulations. Although we generally seek indemnification from sellers covering these matters, we may nevertheless have material liabilities for past activities of acquired hospitals.\nState efforts to regulate the construction, acquisition or expansion of healthcare facilities could limit our ability to build or acquire additional healthcare facilities, renovate our facilities or expand the breadth of services we offer.\nSome states in which we operate require a CON or other prior approval for the construction or acquisition of healthcare facilities, capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount, changes in bed capacity or services and some other matters. In evaluating a proposal, these states consider the need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities or services. If we are not able to obtain required CONs or other prior approvals, we would not be able to acquire, operate, replace or expand our facilities or expand the breadth of services we offer. Furthermore, if a CON or other prior approval upon which we relied to invest in construction of a replacement or expanded facility were to be revoked or lost through an appeal process, we may not be able to recover the value of our investment.\nState efforts to regulate the sale of hospitals operated by municipal or not-for-profit entities could prevent us from acquiring these types of hospitals and executing our business strategy.\nMany states have adopted legislation regarding the sale or other disposition of hospitals operated by municipal or not-for-profit entities. In some states that do not have specific legislation, the attorneys general have demonstrated an interest in these transactions under their general obligation to protect the use of charitable assets. These legislative and administrative efforts focus primarily on the appropriate valuation of the assets divested and the use of the proceeds of the sale by the non-profit seller. While these review and, in some instances, approval processes can add additional time to the closing of a hospital acquisition, we have not had any significant difficulties or delays in completing acquisitions. However, future state actions could seriously delay or even prevent our ability to acquire hospitals.\nIf we are unable to effectively compete for patients, local residents could use other hospitals and healthcare providers.\nThe healthcare industry is highly competitive among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients, affiliations with physicians and acquisitions. The competition among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients has intensified in recent years. However, the majority of our hospitals are located in non-urban service areas where we believe we are the sole provider of general acute care health services. As a result, the most significant competition our hospitals face typically comes from hospitals outside of our primary service areas, including hospitals in urban areas that provide more complex services. Patients in our primary service areas may travel to these other hospitals because of physician referrals or their need for services we do not offer, among other reasons. Patients who receive services from these other hospitals may subsequently shift their preferences to those hospitals for the services we provide. Competition for patients is also increasing among other healthcare providers, including outpatient surgery, orthopedic, oncology and diagnostic centers. Our hospitals and our competitors are implementing physician alignment strategies, such as acquiring physician practice groups, employing physicians and participating in ACOs or other clinical integration models, which may impact our competitive position.\nAt December 31, 2015, 63 of our hospitals competed with more than one other hospital in their respective primary service areas. In most markets in which we are not the sole provider of general acute care health services, our primary competitor is a municipal or not-for-profit hospital. These hospitals are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or not-for-profit entities supported by endowments and charitable contributions. They do not pay income or property taxes, and can make capital expenditures without paying sales tax. These financial advantages may better position these hospitals to maintain more modern and technologically upgraded facilities and equipment and offer services more specialized than those available at our hospitals. If our competitors are better able to attract patients with these offerings, we may experience an overall decline in patient volume.\nTrends toward clinical transparency and value-based purchasing may have an unanticipated impact on our competitive position and patient volumes. The CMS Hospital Compare website makes available to the public certain data that hospitals submit in connection with Medicare reimbursement claims, including performance data related to quality measures and patient satisfaction surveys. Federal law provides for the future expansion of the number of quality measures that must be reported. Further, every hospital must establish and update annually a public listing of the hospital\u2019s standard charges for items and services or publish its policies for allowing the public to view a list of these charges in response to an inquiry. If any of our hospitals achieve poor results (or results that are lower than our competitors) on these quality measures or on patient satisfaction surveys, or if our standard charges are higher than our competitors, we may attract fewer patients.\nWe expect these competitive trends to continue. If we are unable to compete effectively with other hospitals and other healthcare providers, local residents may seek healthcare services at providers other than our hospitals and affiliated businesses.\nThe failure to obtain our medical supplies at favorable prices could cause our operating results to decline.\nWe have a participation agreement with HealthTrust, a GPO. The current term of this agreement expires in January 2017, with automatic renewal terms of one year unless either party terminates by giving notice of non-renewal. GPOs attempt to obtain favorable pricing on medical supplies with manufacturers and vendors, sometimes by negotiating exclusive supply arrangements in exchange for discounts. To the extent these exclusive supply arrangements are challenged or deemed unenforceable, we could incur higher costs for our medical supplies obtained through HealthTrust. Further, costs of supplies and drugs may continue to increase due to market pressure from pharmaceutical companies and new product releases. Higher costs could continue to adversely impact our operating results. Also, there can be no assurance that our arrangement with HealthTrust will provide the discounts we expect to achieve.\nIf the fair value of our reporting units declines, a material non-cash charge to earnings from impairment of our goodwill could result.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had approximately $9.0 billion of goodwill recorded on our books, including approximately $4.5 billion of goodwill resulting from the acquisition of HMA. We expect to recover the carrying value of this goodwill through our future cash flows. On an ongoing basis, under GAAP, we evaluate, based on the fair value of our reporting units, whether the carrying value of our goodwill is impaired when events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying value may not be recoverable. GAAP requires us to test goodwill for impairment at least annually. The testing of goodwill for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions related to our cost of capital and other factors impacting our fair value models. These estimates can be affected by various factors, including changes in economic, industry or other market assumptions, changes in our business operations, and potential changes in our stock price and market capitalization. Changes in these factors, or changes in our actual performance compared with our estimates of future projections, could affect our calculation of the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in an impairment charge to goodwill.\nNo impairment was indicated in connection with our last annual goodwill evaluation conducted during the fourth quarter of 2015. However, based on the excess of fair value over the carrying value, our hospital operations reporting unit was at risk of goodwill impairment as of December 31, 2015, primarily due to a decline in our stock price during the fourth quarter and lower projections of future cash flows.\nIf the carrying value of our goodwill is impaired, we may incur a material non-cash charge to earnings during the period in which the impairment is determined.\nA significant decline in operating results or other indicators of impairment at one or more of our facilities could result in a material, non-cash charge to earnings to impair the value of long-lived assets.\nOur operations are capital intensive and require significant investment in long-lived assets, such as property, equipment and other long-lived intangible assets, including capitalized internal-use software. If one of our facilities experiences declining operating results or is adversely impacted by one or more of these risk factors, we may not be able to recover the carrying value of those assets through our future operating cash flows. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate whether changes in future undiscounted cash flows reflect an impairment in the fair value of our long-lived assets. If the carrying value of those assets is impaired, we may incur a material non-cash charge to earnings.\nWe are subject to uncertainties regarding healthcare reform.\nThe U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have introduced and passed a large number of proposals and legislation designed to make major changes in the healthcare system, including changes that increase access to health insurance. In particular, the Reform Legislation mandates that substantially all U.S. citizens maintain medical insurance coverage and expands health insurance coverage through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health insurance reforms. Based on projections issued by the CBO in March 2015, the incremental insurance coverage due to the Reform Legislation could result in 25 million formerly uninsured Americans gaining coverage by the end of 2025.\nStates may opt out of the Medicaid coverage expansion provisions of the Reform Legislation without losing existing federal Medicaid funding. A number of states have opted out of the Medicaid coverage expansion provisions, but could ultimately decide to expand their programs at a later date. At our hospitals in these states, the number of uninsured patients will likely decline by a smaller margin than we initially expected when the Reform Legislation was first adopted. Of the 28 states in which we operate hospitals that are included in continuing operations, 15 states have expanded their Medicaid programs. At this time, the other 13 states have not, including Florida, Tennessee and Texas, where we operated a significant number of hospitals as of December 31, 2015. Some states that have opted out are evaluating options such as waiver plans to operate an alternative Medicaid expansion plan.\nThe Reform Legislation also makes a number of changes to Medicare and Medicaid that could adversely impact the reimbursement our facilities receive under these programs, such as reductions to the Medicare annual market basket update through federal fiscal year 2019, a productivity offset to the Medicare market basket update, and a reduction to the Medicare and Medicaid disproportionate share payments. Despite these provisions, we believe that the Reform Legislation had a positive impact on net operating revenues and income from continuing operations during 2014 and 2015 as the result of the expansion of private sector and Medicaid coverage that has already occurred from the Reform Legislation. We believe that the net impact of the Reform Legislation on our net operating revenues will continue to be positive, but there can be no assurances that such impact will continue to remain positive in the future.\nAlso included in the Reform Legislation are provisions aimed at reducing fraud, waste and abuse in the healthcare industry. These provisions allocate significant additional resources to federal enforcement agencies and expand the use of private contractors to recover potentially inappropriate Medicare and Medicaid payments. The Reform Legislation amends several existing federal laws, including the anti-kickback statute and the FCA, making it easier for government agencies and private plaintiffs to prevail in lawsuits brought against healthcare providers. These amendments also make it easier for potentially severe fines and penalties to be imposed on healthcare providers accused of violating applicable laws and regulations.\nBecause of the many variables involved, including clarifications and modifications resulting from the rule-making process, legislative efforts to repeal or modify the law, judicial interpretations resulting from court challenges to its constitutionality and interpretation, the development of agency guidance, whether and how many states ultimately decide to expand Medicaid coverage, the number of uninsured who elect to purchase health insurance coverage, uncertainty regarding the long-term viability of the health insurance exchanges, budgetary issues at federal and state levels, and the potential for delays in the implementation of the Reform Legislation, we may not be able to realize the positive impact the Reform Legislation may have on our business, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity. Furthermore, we cannot predict whether we will be able to modify certain aspects of our operations to offset any potential adverse consequences from the Reform Legislation or other federal or state health reform initiatives.\nIf reimbursement rates paid by federal or state healthcare programs or commercial payors are reduced, if we are unable to maintain favorable contract terms with payors or comply with our payor contract obligations, if insured individuals move to insurance plans with greater coverage exclusions or narrower networks, or if insurance coverage is otherwise restricted, our net operating revenues may decline.\nIn 2015, 35.3% of our operating revenues, net of contractual allowances and discounts (but before the provision for bad debts), came from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Federal healthcare expenditures continue to increase and state governments continue to face budgetary shortfalls as a result of current economic conditions and increasing Medicaid enrollment. As a result of such events and also pursuant to the Reform Legislation, federal and state governments have made, and continue to make, significant changes in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including reductions in reimbursement levels and supplemental payment programs like disproportionate share payments. Some of these changes have decreased, or could decrease, the amount of money we receive for our services relating to these programs.\nIn addition, government and commercial payors as well as other third parties from whom we receive payment for our services attempt to control healthcare costs by, for example, requiring hospitals to discount payments for their services in exchange for exclusive or preferred participation in their benefit plans, restricting coverage through utilization review, reducing coverage of inpatient services and shifting care to outpatient settings, requiring prior authorizations, and implementing alternative payment models. The ability of commercial payors to control healthcare costs using these measures may be enhanced by the increasing consolidation of insurance and managed care companies.\nIn 2015, 52.4% of our operating revenues, net of contractual allowances and discounts (but before the provision for bad debts), came from commercial payors. Our contracts with payors require us to comply with a\nnumber of terms related to the provision of services and billing for services. If we are unable to negotiate increased reimbursement rates, maintain existing rates or other favorable contract terms, effectively respond to payor cost controls or comply with the terms of our payor contracts, the payments we receive for our services may be reduced or we may be involved in disputes with payors and experience payment denials, both prospectively and retroactively. In addition, some individuals may move from existing coverage under health insurance plans with higher reimbursement rates for our services and lower co-pays and deductibles to plans, such as those purchased on the health insurance exchanges, that may provide for lower reimbursement for our services along with higher co-pays and deductibles or even exclusion of our hospitals and employed physicians from coverage.\nWe may be adversely affected by consolidation among health insurers.\nIn recent years, a number of health insurers have merged or increased efforts to consolidate with other payors as well as providers, in part, as a result of the medical loss ratio (\u201cMLR\u201d) requirements imposed by the Reform Legislation. The MLR represents the percentage of premiums used to pay customer medical claims and for other activities that improve the quality of care. Health insurers that do not meet minimum MLR requirements must pay premium rebates on individual and group medical insurance products and, for certain Medicare products, may be subject to additional penalties. Our ability to negotiate prices and favorable terms with health insurers in certain markets could be affected negatively as a result of these efforts. Also, the shift toward value-based payment models could be accelerated if larger insurers find these models to be financially beneficial. We cannot predict whether we will be able to respond effectively to the impact of increased consolidation in the payor industry.\nIf we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations, including fraud and abuse laws, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.\nThe healthcare industry is governed by laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels. These laws and regulations include standards addressing, among other issues, the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures; billing and coding for services; properly handling overpayments; classification of levels of care provided; preparing and filing of cost reports; relationships with referral sources and referral recipients; maintenance of adequate records; compliance with building codes; environmental protection; and privacy and security. Examples of these laws include, but are not limited to, HIPAA, the Stark Law, the federal anti-kickback statute, the FCA, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act and similar state laws. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil sanctions and criminal penalties, including the loss of our operating licenses and our ability to participate in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs.\nIn addition, there are heightened coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts by both federal and state government agencies relating to the healthcare industry, including the hospital segment. Recent enforcement actions have focused on financial arrangements between hospitals and physicians, billing for services without adequately documenting medical necessity and billing for services outside the coverage guidelines for such services. Specific to our hospitals, we have received inquiries and subpoenas from various governmental agencies regarding these and other matters, and we are also subject to various claims and lawsuits relating to such matters. For a further discussion of these matters, see \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K.\nIn the future, evolving interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses.\nIf we become subject to significant legal actions, we could be subject to substantial uninsured liabilities or increased insurance costs.\nPhysicians, hospitals and other healthcare providers have become subject to an increasing number of legal actions alleging malpractice, product liability, or related legal theories. Even in states that have imposed caps on damages, litigants are seeking recoveries under new theories of liability that might not be subject to the caps on damages. Many of these actions involve large claims and significant defense costs. To protect us from the cost of these claims, we maintain claims made professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance coverage in excess of those amounts for which we are self-insured. This insurance coverage is in amounts that we believe to be sufficient for our operations; however, our insurance coverage may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost for us to maintain adequate levels of insurance. Additionally, our insurance coverage does not cover all claims against us, such as fines, penalties, or other damage and legal expense payments resulting from qui tam lawsuits.\nWe could be subject to increased monetary penalties and/or other sanctions, including exclusion from federal health care programs, if we fail to comply with the terms of the Corporate Integrity Agreement.\nOn August 4, 2014, we announced that we had entered into a civil settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, other federal agencies and identified relators that concluded previously announced investigations and litigation related to short stay admissions through emergency departments at certain of our affiliated hospitals. See our discussion of this matter under the section \u201cBusiness of Community Health Systems, Inc.\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K and \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Part II, Item 1 of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2014 for further discussion of the background of this matter and details of the settlement. In addition to the amounts paid in the settlement, we executed the CIA with the OIG that has been incorporated into our existing and comprehensive compliance program.\nMaterial, uncorrected violations of the CIA could lead to our suspension or disbarment from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs and repayment obligations. In addition, we are subject to possible civil penalties for failure to substantially comply with the terms of the CIA, including stipulated penalties ranging between $1,000 to $2,500 per day. We are also subject to a stipulated penalty of $50,000 for each false certification made by us or on our behalf, pursuant to the reporting provisions of the CIA. The CIA increases the amount of information we must provide to the federal government regarding our healthcare practices and our compliance with federal regulations. The reports we provide in connection with the CIA could result in greater scrutiny by regulatory authorities.\nIf we experience growth in self-pay volume and revenues, or if we experience continued deterioration in the collectability of patient responsibility accounts, our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and outstanding patient balances for which the primary insurance payor has paid some but not all of the outstanding balance, with the remaining outstanding balance (generally deductibles and co-payments) owed by the patient. Collections are impacted by the economic ability of patients to pay and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. Significant changes in payor mix, business office operations, economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental healthcare coverage may affect our collection of accounts receivable and are considered in our estimates of accounts receivable collectability.\nSince the implementation of the Reform Legislation, our self-pay revenues as a percentage of total revenue have decreased, primarily resulting from a shift from self-pay to Medicaid and private insurers for a portion of our patient population, driven by the insurance coverage expansion provisions of the Reform Legislation. In addition, the Reform Legislation\u2019s future impact on the uninsured population and the percentage of our total revenue comprised of self-pay revenues may be different than anticipated because of, among other variables,\nuncertainty regarding the number and identity of states that ultimately choose to expand Medicaid, the number of uninsured who elect to purchase health insurance, and efforts to repeal or revise the Reform Legislation. Moreover, we may still be adversely affected by the growth in patient responsibility accounts as a result of increases in the adoption of plan structures, including health savings accounts, narrow networks and tiered networks, that shift greater responsibility for care to individuals through greater exclusions and copayment and deductible amounts. Further, our ability to collect patient responsibility accounts may be limited by statutory, regulatory and investigatory initiatives, including private lawsuits directed at hospital charges and collection practices for uninsured and underinsured patients. In addition, a deterioration of economic conditions in the United States could potentially lead to higher levels of uninsured patients, result in higher levels of patients covered by lower paying government programs, result in fiscal uncertainties at both government payors and private insurers and/or limit the economic ability of patients to make payments for which they are responsible. If we experience growth in self-pay volume or further deterioration in collectability of patient responsibility accounts, our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe failure of certain employers, or the closure of certain manufacturing and other facilities in our markets, could have a disproportionate impact on our hospitals.\nThe economies in the non-urban communities in which our hospitals primarily operate are often dependent on a small number of large employers, especially manufacturing or other facilities. These employers often provide income and health insurance for a disproportionately large number of community residents who may depend on our hospitals for care. The failure of one or more large employers, or the closure or substantial reduction in the number of individuals employed at manufacturing or other facilities located in or near many of the non-urban communities in which our hospitals primarily operate, could cause affected employees to move elsewhere for employment or lose insurance coverage that was otherwise available to them. The occurrence of these events may cause a reduction in our revenues and adversely impact our results of operations.\nIf there are delays in regulatory updates by governmental entities to federal and state healthcare programs, we may experience increased volatility in our operating results as such delays may result in a timing difference between when such program revenues are earned and when they become known or estimable for purposes of accounting recognition.\nWe derive a significant amount of our net operating revenues from governmental healthcare programs, primarily Medicare and Medicaid. The reimbursements due to us from those programs are subject to legislative and regulatory changes that can have a significant impact on our operating results. When delays occur in the implementation of regulations or passage of legislation, there is the potential for material increases or decreases in operating revenues to be recognized in periods subsequent to when such related services were performed, resulting in the potential for an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations.\nIf our adoption and utilization of electronic health record systems fails to achieve the required measures for meaningful use, our consolidated results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAs a result of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, eligible hospitals and healthcare professionals can receive incentive payments for their adoption and meaningful use of EHR technology. The implementation of EHR technology that meets the meaningful use criteria requires a significant capital investment, and we have and intend to continue to offset some of these costs by maximizing our receipt of incentive payments. Eligible hospitals and professionals that fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology and have not applied and qualified for a hardship exception are subject to reduced reimbursement from Medicare. Thus, if our hospitals and employed professionals are unable to comply with the meaningful use standards, we will not be eligible to receive incentive payments that could offset some of the costs of implementing EHR systems, and we could be subject to penalties that may have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations.\nThe transition to ICD-10 coding may adversely impact our consolidated results of operations.\nAll healthcare providers covered by HIPAA, including our hospitals, were required to transition by October 1, 2015 to the ICD-10 code set to report medical diagnoses and inpatient procedures. ICD-10 significantly expands the number of and detail in the codes used by providers to bill for services. All of our hospitals have transitioned to the ICD-10 coding system, which continues to involve a significant capital investment in technology and coding of our information systems, as well as significant costs related to training of staff involved with coding and billing. These ICD-10 transition costs and any difficulty or delays in payors and providers transitioning to this significantly more detailed code set could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. The potential for delay in billing and collection on patient receivables could also have an adverse effect on the quality of receivables that serve as collateral for borrowings under our receivables facility, resulting in a potential default or repayment of outstanding borrowings.\nA cybersecurity attack or security breach could cause a loss of confidential data, give rise to remediation and other expenses, expose us to liability under HIPAA, consumer protection laws, common law or other theories, subject us to litigation and federal and state governmental inquiries, damage our reputation, and otherwise be disruptive to our business.\nWe rely extensively on our computer systems to manage clinical and financial data, communicate with our patients, payors, vendors and other third parties and summarize and analyze operating results. We have made significant investments in technology to protect our systems and information from cybersecurity risks. During the second quarter of 2014, our computer network was the target of an external, criminal cyber-attack in which the attacker successfully copied and transferred certain data outside the Company. This data included certain non-medical patient identification data (such as patient names, addresses, birthdates, telephone numbers and social security numbers) considered protected under HIPAA, but did not include patient credit card, medical or clinical information. The remediation efforts in response to the attack have been substantial, including continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access. Also in connection with the cyber-attack, we have been subject to multiple purported class action lawsuits and may be subject to additional litigation, potential governmental inquiries and potential reputation damages.\nIn spite of our security measures, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to additional cyber-attacks or security breaches in the future. Such attacks or breaches could result in loss of protected health information or other data subject to privacy laws or disrupt our information technology systems or business. We continue to prioritize cybersecurity and the development of practices and controls to protect our systems. As cyber-threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. If we are subject to cyber-attacks or security breaches in the future, this could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of a contagious disease in the markets in which we operate or that otherwise impacts our facilities could adversely impact our business.\nIf a pandemic or other public health crisis were to affect our markets, our business could be adversely affected. Such a crisis could diminish the public trust in healthcare facilities, especially hospitals that fail to accurately or timely diagnose, or that are treating (or have treated) patients affected by contagious diseases. If any of our facilities were involved in treating patients for such a contagious disease, other patients might cancel elective procedures or fail to seek needed care at our facilities. Further, a pandemic might adversely impact our business by causing a temporary shutdown or diversion of patients, by disrupting or delaying production and delivery of materials and products in the supply chain or by causing staffing shortages in our facilities. Although we have disaster plans in place and operate pursuant to infectious disease protocols, the potential impact of a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of a contagious disease with respect to our markets or our facilities is difficult to predict and could adversely impact our business.\nOur performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians.\nAlthough we employ some physicians, physicians are often not employees at our healthcare facilities at which they practice. The success of our healthcare facilities depends in part on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our healthcare facilities, our ability to employ quality physicians, the admitting and utilization practices of employed and independent physicians, maintaining good relations with those physicians and controlling costs related to the employment of physicians. In many of the markets we serve, many physicians have admitting privileges at other healthcare facilities in addition to our healthcare facilities. Such physicians may terminate their affiliation with or employment by our healthcare facilities at any time. If we are unable to provide adequate support personnel or technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians and their patients, they may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities, admissions may decrease and our operating performance may decline.\nOur labor costs could be adversely affected by competition for staffing, the shortage of experienced nurses and labor union activity.\nIn addition to our physicians, the operations of our hospitals are dependent on the efforts, abilities and experience of our management and medical support personnel, such as nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians. We compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified management and support personnel responsible for the daily operations of our hospitals, including nurses and other non-physician healthcare professionals. In some markets, the availability of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue to healthcare providers. We may be required to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. In addition, the states in which we operate could adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory nurse-staffing ratios already in place. State-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs and have an adverse impact on revenues if we are required to limit admissions in order to meet the required ratios.\nIncreased or ongoing labor union activity is another factor that could adversely affect our labor costs or otherwise adversely impact us. To the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, our labor costs could increase significantly. In addition, when negotiating collective bargaining agreements with unions, whether such agreements are renewals or first contracts, there is the possibility that strikes could occur during the negotiation process, and our continued operation during any strikes could increase our labor costs and otherwise adversely impact us.\nIf our labor costs increase, we may not be able to raise rates to offset these increased costs. Because a significant percentage of our revenues consists of fixed, prospective payments, our ability to pass along increased labor costs is constrained. In the event we are not entirely effective at recruiting and retaining qualified management, nurses and other medical support personnel, or in controlling labor costs, this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe industry trend towards value-based purchasing may negatively impact our revenues.\nThe trend toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services is gaining momentum across the healthcare industry among both government and commercial payors. Generally, value-based purchasing initiatives tie payment to the quality and efficiency of care. For example, hospital payments may be negatively impacted by the occurrence of HACs. As of federal fiscal year 2015, hospitals that fall into the top 25% of national risk-adjusted HAC rates for all hospitals in the previous year receive a 1% reduction in their total Medicare payments. Medicare does not reimburse for care related to HACs. In addition, federal funds may not be used under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for services provided to treat HACs. Hospitals that experience excess readmissions for designated conditions receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges. HHS also reduces Medicare inpatient hospital payments for all discharges by a required percentage and pools the amount collected\nfrom these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards. Further, Medicare and Medicaid require hospitals to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates.\nHHS has indicated that it is particularly focused on tying Medicare payments to quality or value through alternative payment models, which generally aim to make providers attentive to the quality and cost of care they deliver to patients. Examples of alternative payment models include ACOs and bundled payment arrangements. Beginning in April 2016, HHS will require hospitals in certain geographic areas to participate in a bundled payment program for specified joint replacement procedures, and HHS may increasingly establish similar mandatory programs. It is unclear whether alternative payment models will successfully coordinate care and reduce costs or whether they will decrease aggregate reimbursement. Several of the nation\u2019s largest commercial payors have also expressed an intent to increase reliance on value-based reimbursement arrangements. Further, many large commercial payors require hospitals to report quality data, and several commercial payors do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events.\nWe expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts. We are unable at this time to predict how this trend will affect our results of operations, but it could negatively impact our revenues or our cost of operations, or both.\nOur revenues are concentrated in a small number of states which will make us particularly sensitive to regulatory and economic changes in those states.\nOur revenues are particularly sensitive to regulatory and economic changes in states in which we generate a significant portion of our revenues, including Florida, Pennsylvania, Texas, Indiana and Tennessee. Accordingly, any change in the current demographic, economic, competitive or regulatory conditions in these states could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Changes to the Medicaid programs in these states could also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. For example, in 2014, CMS deferred the federal portion of Medicaid payments associated with the Texas Medicaid Waiver Program, a measure it has since lifted. The waiver for the Texas program expires on September 30, 2016. Texas has submitted an application to extend its Medicaid Waiver Program, but CMS has not yet issued a decision. We cannot predict whether the Texas Medicaid Waiver Program will be extended, continue in its current form or guarantee that revenues recognized from the program will not decrease.\nThe proposed spin-off of a group of our hospitals and Quorum Health Resources into an independent, publicly-traded corporation may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or terms, or at all, and may not achieve the intended benefits.\nIn August 2015, we announced a plan to spin off 38 of our hospitals and Quorum Health Resources into QHC, an independent, publicly-traded corporation. We expect to complete the spin-off in the first half of 2016, although there can be no assurance as to whether or when the spin-off will occur. Various developments, including related to (i) obtaining various tax and regulatory approvals, (ii) the execution of operational transitional agreements, (iii) receiving opinions of tax, legal and valuation advisors (including as to the tax-free nature of the transaction) and (iv) market conditions, could delay or prevent the proposed spin-off or cause the proposed spin-off to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable and/or different than expected. In addition, even if completed, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from the spin-off, and expenses incurred in connection with the proposed spin-off may be significantly higher than we currently anticipate.\nWe and our stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities if the distribution were to be deemed a taxable event.\nIn Rev. Proc. 2013-12, the IRS announced that, effective for ruling requests postmarked or received after August 23, 2013, it generally will no longer provide private letter rulings to the effect that a spin-off transaction\n(similar to the contribution of the businesses by us to QHC and the distribution of QHC common stock in connection with the proposed spin-off transaction) will qualify as a tax-free transaction under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. Consequently, we are not seeking such a ruling from the IRS. However, we submitted a request for a private letter ruling from the IRS as to whether the anticipated distribution by QHC of QHC senior notes to us in connection with the proposed spin-off transaction satisfies certain U.S. federal income tax requirements. On December 21, 2015, we received a favorable ruling with respect to the distribution by QHC of QHC senior notes. Moreover, it is a condition to the distribution that we receive an opinion from our outside tax advisor, Deloitte Tax LLP, to the effect that the distribution of QHC common stock should qualify as generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code. However, this opinion will not be binding on the IRS or the courts. In addition, the opinion from Deloitte Tax LLP will rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from us and QHC regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is incorrect or not satisfied, we and our stockholders may not be able to rely on the opinion of Deloitte Tax LLP and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding our receipt of the opinion from Deloitte Tax LLP, there can be no assurance that the IRS will determine that the distribution is not a taxable event. If the distribution is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and our stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. In addition, even if the spin-off otherwise qualifies as a tax-free transaction, the distribution could be taxable to us (and, in certain circumstances, to our stockholders) if future significant acquisitions of our stock or the stock of QHC following the distribution are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the spin-off.", "PERMNO": 88284, "SIC": 8062, "TIC": "CYH"}
