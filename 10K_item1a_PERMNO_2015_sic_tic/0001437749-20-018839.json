RISK FACTORS\nThe following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Investors should also refer to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our financial statements including the related notes. Investors should carefully consider all risks, including those disclosed, before making an investment decision.\nThe ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to materially adversely affect our business, our results of operations and our overall financial performance.\nThe ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the world economy, disrupted financial markets and international trade, resulted in increased unemployment levels and significantly impacted global supply chains, all of which have negatively affected and continue to materially negatively affect the retail industry and the Company\u2019s business. COVID-19 continues to spread both in the U.S. and globally, and related government and private sector mitigation efforts, including travel restrictions, border closings, restrictions on public gatherings, especially when congregating in heavily populated areas, such as malls and shopping centers, shelter-in-place restrictions and limitations on business, including requiring reduction of operating hours and forced temporary closures of non-essential retailers and other businesses, have adversely affected and are expected to continue to adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and liquidity. In particular, the continued spread of COVID-19 and efforts to contain the virus:\n\u25cf\nresulted in significant declines in net sales across our segments and could continue to impact customer demand for our products and services and customer spending levels, including a sustained long-term adverse impact on future foot traffic to our retail locations as a result of any changes to customer shopping patterns and behaviors, such as consumer willingness to visit physical retail locations, including our design centers;\n\u25cf\ncontinue to reduce the availability and productivity and impact the health and well-being of our employees, customers and business partners;\n\u25cf\ncontinue to cause us to experience a material increase in costs as a result of sustained mitigation measures, delayed payments from our customers and uncollectable accounts;\n\u25cf\ncontinue to cause disruptions in the availability of and timely delivery of materials used in our operations;\n\u25cf\nmay materially and adversely impact our liquidity position and cost of, and ability to access, funds from financial institutions and capital markets; and\n\u25cf\ncause other unpredictable events that we currently cannot anticipate.\nWe have instituted measures to ensure our supply chain remains open to us; however, there has been some recent raw material supply chain challenges related to suppliers negatively impacted by COVID-19 shutdowns and shipping delays. These global supply chain challenges could continue and in turn materially adversely impact our manufacturing production and fulfillment of backlog. Furthermore, any significant reduction in consumer willingness to visit our design centers, levels of consumer spending, employee willingness to work in our design centers, or additional closures of our design centers or distribution centers, relating to COVID-19 or its impact on the economy, consumer sentiment or health concerns, already resulted and could result in a further loss of revenues, profits, cash flows, and other materially impactful effects on our business and operations. Our customers may have been, and may continue to be negatively affected by layoffs or work reductions as a result of the global economic downturn caused by COVID-19, which may have negatively impacted, and could continue to negatively impact demand for our products as customers delay or reduce discretionary purchases. Any significant reduction in customer traffic and spending at our design center, caused directly or indirectly by COVID-19, would continue to result in a loss of revenue and profits and could result in other material adverse effects.\nIn addition, we implemented work-from-home policies for certain employees. These working arrangements as well as other related restrictions including severe limitations on travel may have an impact on our operations and management effectiveness. Although we have technology and other resources to support these new work requirements, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer material risks to our business, operations, productivity and results of operations as a result of these restrictions. If a significant percentage of our workforce is unable to work, including because of illness or travel or government restrictions in connection with COVID-19, our retail, distribution and manufacturing operations may be negatively impacted, potentially materially adversely affecting our business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.\nETHAN ALLEN INTERIORS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nAlthough our distribution centers were fully operational as of the date of filing of this Annual Report, governmental mandates or illness or absence of a substantial number of distribution center employees could require that we temporarily close one or more of our distribution centers, or may prohibit or significantly limit us, or our third party logistics providers, from delivering to our customers and our design centers, which would complicate or prevent our fulfilling orders and, once our design centers reopen, would complicate or prevent our ability to supply merchandise to these design centers. Further, although we continue to implement strong physical and cyber-security measures to ensure that our business operations remain functional and to ensure uninterrupted service to our customers, our systems and our operations remain vulnerable to cyber-attacks and other disruptions due to the fact that a significant portion of our employees work remotely as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, and we cannot be certain that our mitigation efforts will be effective.\nThe extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the virus and related restrictions. At this time, given the uncertainty of the lasting effect of COVID-19, the financial impact on the world economy, and in particular, our business, cannot be determined. Further, despite our efforts to manage various impacts, the situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid and the potential for a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity increases the longer the virus impacts activity levels in the U.S. and globally. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 outbreak as well as third-party actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects. Therefore, we currently cannot estimate with any degree of certainty the potential impact to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may require funding from external sources, which may not be available at the levels we require, or may cost more than we expect, and, as a consequence, our expenses and operating results could be negatively affected.\nOur liquidity could be further negatively impacted if the COVID-19 pandemic continues to persist for a significant period of time and we may be required to pursue additional sources of financing to obtain working capital, maintain appropriate inventory levels and meet our financial obligations. Depending on the continued impact of the crisis, further actions may be required to improve our cash position and capital structure. Concerns over the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused extreme volatility in financial and capital markets, which has adversely impacted our stock price and may materially adversely affect our ability to access capital markets.\nWe regularly review and evaluate our liquidity and capital needs. We believe that our available cash, cash equivalents and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to finance our operations and expected capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, we might experience periods during which we encounter additional cash needs, and we might need additional external funding to support our operations.\nIn the event we require additional liquidity from our lenders, such funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, in the event we were to breach any of our financial covenants, our banks would not be required to provide us with additional funding, or they may require us to renegotiate our existing credit facility on less favorable terms. In addition, we may not be able to renew our letters of credit that we use to help pay our suppliers, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, as the availability of credit facilities may become limited. Further, the providers of such credit may reallocate the available credit to other borrowers. If we are unable to access additional credit at the levels we require, or the cost of credit is greater than expected, it could adversely affect our operating results.\nDeclines in certain economic conditions, which impact consumer confidence and consumer spending, could negatively impact our sales, results of operations and liquidity.\nThe furniture industry and our business is particularly sensitive to declines in general economic conditions and to uncertainty regarding future economic prospects, including the current and evolving negative economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our principal products are consumer goods that may be considered postponable purchases. Economic downturns and prolonged negative conditions in the economy could affect consumer spending habits by decreasing the overall demand for discretionary items, including home furnishings. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our products, generally decline during periods when disposable income is limited, unemployment rates increase or there is uncertainty about future economic prospects. In addition, changes in interest rates, consumer confidence, new housing starts, existing home sales, the availability of consumer credit and broader national or geopolitical factors also impact our business. We have seen negative effects on certain of these measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Consumer spending could remain depressed for an extended time and improvement in our sales could lag behind a general economic recovery as consumers may postpone the purchase of relatively higher-cost discretionary items.\nETHAN ALLEN INTERIORS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nAn overall decline in the health of the economy and consumer spending may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items, which could reduce demand for our products and materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition.\nOur business depends on consumer demand for our products and, consequently, is sensitive to a number of factors that influence general consumer spending on discretionary items in particular. Factors influencing consumer spending include general economic conditions, consumer disposable income, fuel prices, recession and fears of recession, unemployment, war and fears of war, inclement weather, availability of consumer credit, consumer debt levels, conditions in the housing market, interest rates, sales tax rates and rate increases, inflation, civil disturbances and terrorist activities, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, consumer confidence in future economic and political conditions, natural disasters, and consumer perceptions of personal well-being and security, including health epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, demand for certain of our products decreased during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 as a result of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and weakened consumer confidence in the economy and financial markets. Prolonged or pervasive economic downturns could slow the pace of new design center openings or cause current design centers to temporarily or permanently close. Adverse changes in factors affecting discretionary consumer spending have reduced and may continue to further reduce consumer demand for our products, thus reducing our sales and harming our business and operating results.\nHistorically, the home furnishings industry has been subject to cyclical variations in the general economy and to uncertainty regarding future economic prospects. Should the current economic recovery falter or the current recovery in housing starts to stall, consumer confidence and demand for home furnishings could deteriorate, which could adversely affect our business through its impact on the performance of our Company-owned design centers, as well as on our independent licensees and the ability of a number of them to meet their obligations to us.\nOur business and results of operations are affected by international, national and regional economic conditions. Regional economic conditions in the United States and in other regions of the world where we have a concentration of design centers such as Canada or China, may have a greater impact on the Company compared to economic conditions in other parts of the world where we have lesser concentration of design centers. An economic downturn of significance or extended duration could adversely affect consumer demand and discretionary spending habits and, as a result, our business performance, profitability, and cash flows.\nOther financial or operational difficulties due to competition may result in a decrease in our sales, earnings, and liquidity.\nThe residential furniture industry is highly competitive and fragmented. We currently compete with many other manufacturers and retailers, including online retailers, some of which offer widely advertised products, and others, several of which are large retail furniture dealers offering their own store-branded products. Competition in the residential furniture industry is based on quality, style of products, perceived value, price, service to the customer, promotional activities, and advertising. The highly competitive nature of the industry means we are constantly subject to the risk of losing market share, which would likely decrease our future sales, earnings, and liquidity.\nA significant shift in consumer preference toward purchasing products online could have a materially adverse impact on our sales and operating margin.\nA majority of our business relies on physical design centers that merchandise and sell our products and a significant shift in consumer preference toward purchasing products online could have a materially adverse impact on our sales and operating margin. In the past year we have experienced lower traffic to our company-owned design centers, similar to other furniture retailers, as consumers have shifted to purchasing more furniture product online. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift to online furniture purchases by changing customer shopping patterns and behaviors, including decreased consumer willingness to visit physical retail locations. We are attempting to meet consumers where they prefer to shop by expanding our online capabilities and improving the user experience at ethanallen.com to drive more traffic to both our online site and our physical design centers.\nRapidly evolving technologies are altering the manner in which the Company and its competitors communicate and transact with customers. Our strategy designed to adapt to these changes, in the context of competitors\u2019 actions, customers adoption of new technology, and related changes in customer behavior, presents a specific risk in the event we are unable to successfully execute our plans or adjust them over time if needed. Further, unanticipated changes in pricing and other practices of competitors, including promotional activity, such as thresholds for free shipping and rapid price fluctuation enabled by technology, may adversely affect our performance.\nETHAN ALLEN INTERIORS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nInability to maintain and enhance our brand may materially adversely impact our business.\nMaintaining and enhancing our brand is critical to our ability to expand our base of customers and may require us to make substantial investments. Our advertising campaign utilizes television, direct mail, digital, newspapers, magazines and radio to maintain and enhance our existing brand equity. We cannot provide assurance that our marketing, advertising and other efforts to promote and maintain awareness of our brand will not require us to incur substantial costs. If these efforts are unsuccessful or we incur substantial costs in connection with these efforts, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to successfully anticipate or respond to changes in consumer tastes and trends in a timely manner could materially adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSales of our products are dependent upon consumer acceptance of our product designs, styles, quality and price. We continuously monitor changes in home design trends through attendance at international industry events and fashion shows, internal marketing research, and regular communication with our retailers and design consultants who provide valuable input on consumer tendencies. However, as with all retailers, our business is susceptible to changes in consumer tastes and trends. Such tastes and trends can change rapidly and any delay or failure to anticipate or respond to changing consumer tastes and trends in a timely manner could materially adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nGlobal and local economic uncertainty may materially adversely affect our manufacturing operations or sources of merchandise and international operations.\nThe current economic challenges in China, including global economic ramifications of the softening of the Chinese economy and trade agreement negotiations, may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions. This economic uncertainty, as well as other variations in global economic conditions such as fuel costs, wage and benefit inflation, and currency fluctuations, may cause inconsistent and unpredictable consumer spending habits, while increasing our own input costs. These risks resulting from global and local economic uncertainty could also severely disrupt our manufacturing operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. We import a portion of our merchandise from foreign countries and operate manufacturing plants in Mexico and Honduras and retail design centers in Canada. As a result, our ability to obtain adequate supplies or to control our costs may be adversely affected by events affecting international commerce and businesses located outside the United States, including natural disasters, public health crises such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, changes in international trade including tariffs, central bank actions, changes in the relationship of the United States dollar versus other currencies, labor availability and cost, and other governmental policies of the United States and the countries from which we import our merchandise or in which we operate facilities.\nThe United States, Mexico and Canada recently entered into a signed trade agreement called The United States - Mexico - Canada Agreement (\u201cUSMCA\u201d) that has been ratified by all three countries. The USMCA will govern trade in North America and replaces the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d). Compared to the previous NAFTA trade agreement, USMCA will increase environmental and labor regulations and will create incentives for more U.S. production of cars and trucks and impose a quota for Canadian and Mexico automotive production. Although we have determined that there have been no immediate effects on our operations with respect to USMCA, we cannot predict future developments in the political climate involving the United States, Mexico and Canada and thus these may have an adverse and material impact on our operations and financial growth.\nCompetition from overseas manufacturers and domestic retailers may materially adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nOur wholesale business segment is involved in the development of our brand, which encompasses the design, manufacture, sourcing, sales and distribution of our home furnishings products, and competes with other United States and foreign manufacturers. Our retail network sells home furnishings to consumers through a network of independently operated and Company-operated design centers, and competes against a diverse group of retailers ranging from specialty stores to traditional furniture and department stores, any of which may operate locally, regionally, nationally or globally, as well as over the internet. We also compete with these and other retailers for retail locations as well as for qualified design consultants and management personnel. Such competition could adversely affect our future financial performance.\nIndustry globalization has led to increased competitive pressures brought about by the increasing volume of imported finished goods and components, particularly for case good products, and the development of manufacturing capabilities in other countries, specifically within Asia. The increase in overseas production has created over-capacity for many manufacturers, including us, which has led to industry-wide plant consolidation. In addition, because many foreign manufacturers are able to maintain substantially lower production costs, including the cost of labor and overhead, imported product may be capable of being sold at a lower price to consumers, which, in turn, could lead to some measure of further industry-wide price deflation.\nETHAN ALLEN INTERIORS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain relationships with sufficient or appropriate manufacturers, whether foreign or domestic, to supply us with selected case goods, upholstery and home accent items to enable us to maintain our competitive advantage. In addition, the emergence of foreign manufacturers has served to broaden the competitive landscape. Some of these competitors produce furniture types not manufactured by us and may have greater financial resources available to them or lower costs of operating. This competition could materially adversely affect our future financial performance.\nDisruptions of our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results.\nDisruption of the Company\u2019s supply chain capabilities due to trade restrictions, political instability, severe weather, natural disasters, public health crises such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, terrorism, product recalls, labor supply or stoppages, the financial and/or operational instability of key suppliers and carriers, or other reasons could impair the Company\u2019s ability to distribute its products. To the extent we are unable to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, there could be a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results.\nOur number of manufacturing and logistics sites may increase our exposure to business disruptions and could result in higher transportation costs.\nWe have a limited number of manufacturing sites in our case goods and upholstery operations and consolidated our distribution network into fewer centers for both wholesale and retail segments. Our upholstery operations consist of two upholstery plants at our North Carolina campus and two plants in Mexico. The Company operates two manufacturing plants (Vermont and Honduras) and one sawmill, one rough mill and one lumberyard in support of our case goods operations. As a result of the consolidation of our manufacturing operations into fewer facilities, if any of our manufacturing or logistics sites experience significant business interruption, our ability to manufacture or deliver our products in a timely manner would likely be impacted. While we have long-standing relationships with multiple outside suppliers of our raw materials and commodities, there can be no assurance of their ability to fulfill our supply needs on a timely basis. The consolidation to fewer locations has resulted in longer distances for delivery and could result in higher costs to transport products if fuel costs increase significantly.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials could result in increased costs or cause production delays which might result in a decline in sales, either of which could materially adversely impact our earnings.\nWe use various types of wood, foam, fibers, fabrics, leathers, and other raw materials in manufacturing our furniture. Certain of our raw materials, including fabrics, are purchased domestically as well as outside North America. Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials could result in increased costs or a delay in manufacturing our products, which in turn could result in a delay in delivering products to our customers. For example, lumber prices fluctuate over time based on factors such as weather and demand, which, in turn, impact availability. Production delays or upward trends in raw material prices could result in lower sales or margins, thereby materially adversely impacting our earnings.\nIn addition, certain suppliers may require extensive advance notice of our requirements in order to produce products in the quantities we desire. This long lead time may require us to place orders far in advance of the time when certain products will be offered for sale, thereby exposing us to risks relating to shifts in consumer demand and trends, and any significant downturn in the United States economy.\nOur current and former manufacturing and retail operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety requirements.\nWe use and generate hazardous substances in our manufacturing and retail operations. In addition, both the manufacturing properties on which we currently operate and those on which we have ceased operations are and have been used for industrial purposes. Our manufacturing operations and, to a lesser extent, our retail operations involve risk of personal injury or death. We are subject to increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to our products, current and former properties and our current operations. These laws and regulations provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations and sometimes require the installation of costly pollution control or safety equipment, or costly changes in operations to limit pollution or decrease the likelihood of injuries. In addition, we may become subject to potentially material liabilities for the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage resulting from exposure to or releases of hazardous substances or personal injury because of an unsafe workplace.\nETHAN ALLEN INTERIORS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIn addition, noncompliance with, or stricter enforcement of, existing laws and regulations, adoption of more stringent new laws and regulations, discovery of previously unknown contamination or imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could be material.\nProduct recalls or product safety concerns could materially adversely affect our sales and operating results.\nIf the Company's merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or consumers' expectations regarding safety, the Company could experience decreased sales, increased costs and/or be exposed to legal and reputational risk. Events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose the Company to government enforcement action and/or private litigation. Reputational damage caused by real or perceived product safety concerns or product recalls could negatively affect the Company's business and results of operations.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems to process transactions, summarize results, and manage our business and that of certain independent retailers. Disruptions in both our primary and back-up systems could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur primary and back-up information technology systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, viruses, phishing attempts, cyber-attacks, malware and ransomware attacks, security breaches, severe weather, natural disasters, and errors by employees. Though losses arising from some of these issues would be covered by insurance, interruptions of our critical business information technology systems or failure of our back-up systems could result in longer production times or negatively impact customers resulting in damage to our reputation and a reduction in sales. If our critical information technology systems or back-up systems were damaged or ceased to function properly, we might have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them.\nSuccessful cyber-attacks and the failure to maintain adequate cyber-security systems and procedures could materially harm our operations.\nIn the current environment, there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, employee malfeasance and human or technological error. High-profile security breaches at other companies and in government agencies have increased in recent years, and security industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cyberattacks targeting businesses such as ours. Cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent, and in some cases have caused significant harm. Computer hackers and others routinely attempt to breach the security of technology products, services and systems, and to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or others to disclose information or unwittingly provide access to systems or data. We operate many aspects of our business including financial reporting, and customer relationship management through server and web-based technologies, and store various types of data on such servers or with third-parties who in turn store it on servers and in the \u201ccloud.\u201d Any disruption to the internet or to the Company's or its service providers' global technology infrastructure, including malware, insecure coding, \u201cActs of God,\u201d attempts to penetrate networks, data theft or loss and human error, could have adverse effects on the Company's operations. A cyber-attack of our systems or networks that impairs our information technology systems could disrupt our business operations and result in loss of service to customers. The risk of cyberattacks to our Company also includes attempted breaches of contractors, business partners, vendors and other third parties. We have a comprehensive cybersecurity program designed to protect and preserve the integrity of our information technology systems. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience actual or attempted cyber-attacks of our IT systems or networks; however, none of these actual or attempted cyber-attacks had a material impact on our operations or financial condition.\nWhile we devote significant resources to network security, data encryption and other security measures to protect our systems and data, including our own proprietary information and the confidential and personally identifiable information of our customers, employees, and business partners, these measures cannot provide absolute security. The costs to eliminate or alleviate network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful, resulting potentially in the theft, loss, destruction or corruption of information we store electronically, as well as unexpected interruptions, delays or cessation of service, any of which could cause harm to our business operations. Moreover, if a computer security breach or cyber-attack affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of proprietary or personally identifiable information, our reputation could be materially damaged, our customer confidence could be diminished, and our operations, including technical support for our devices, could be impaired. We would also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and potential liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nETHAN ALLEN INTERIORS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nLoss, corruption and misappropriation of data and information relating to customers could materially adversely affect our operations.\nWe have access to sensitive customer information in the ordinary course of business. If a significant data breach occurred, our reputation may be adversely affected, customer confidence may be diminished, or we may be subject to legal claims, or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, may have a negative impact on our reputation, may lead to regulatory enforcement actions against us, and may materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. The loss, disclosure or misappropriation of our business information may materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Further, legislative or regulatory action in these areas is evolving, and we may be unable to adapt our IT systems or to manage the IT systems of third parties to accommodate these changes. Finally, if a significant data breach occurred, our reputation could be materially and adversely affected, and confidence among our customers may be diminished.\nChanges in United States trade and tax policy could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nChanges in the political environment in the United States may require us to modify our current business practices. Because we manufacture components and finished goods in Mexico and Honduras and purchase components and finished goods manufactured in foreign countries, including China, we are subject to risks relating to increased tariffs on United States imports, changes in the North American Free Trade Agreement, and other changes affecting imports. Recently, the United States administration considered enacting certain tariffs on many items sourced from China, including certain furniture, accessories, furniture parts, and raw materials that are imported into the United States and used in our domestic operations. We may not be able to fully or substantially mitigate the impact of such tariffs, pass price increases on to our customers, or secure adequate alternative sources of products or materials. The tariffs, along with any additional tariffs or retaliatory trade restrictions implemented by other countries, could negatively impact customer sales, including potential delays in product received from our vendors, our cost of goods sold and results of operations.\nApproximately 25% of our merchandise is sourced from outside of the United States. The United States government has also expressed its intent to alter its approach to trade policy, including, in some instances, to revise, renegotiate or terminate certain multilateral trade agreements. It has also imposed new tariffs on certain foreign goods and raised the possibility of imposing additional increases or new tariffs on other goods. Such actions have, in some cases, already led to retaliatory trade measures by certain foreign governments. Such policies could make it more difficult or costly for us to do business in or import our products from those countries. In turn, we may need to raise prices or make changes to our operations, which could negatively impact our net sales or operating results. At this time, it remains unclear what additional actions, if any, will be taken by the United States government or foreign governments with respect to tariff and international trade agreements and policies, and we cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any revised trade agreements or any impact on our business.\nOur business is dependent on certain key personnel; if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our business may be harmed.\nThe success of our business depends upon our ability to retain continued service of certain key personnel, particularly our Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, M. Farooq Kathwari, and to attract and retain additional qualified key personnel in the future. We face risks related to loss of any key personnel and we also face risks related to any changes that may occur in key senior leadership executive positions. Any disruption in the services of our key personnel could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals and could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition. These changes could also increase the volatility of our stock price.\nThe market for qualified employees and personnel in the retail and manufacturing industries is highly competitive. Our success depends upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified artisans, professional and clerical employees and upon the continued contributions of these individuals. We cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. A shortage of qualified personnel may require us to enhance our wage and benefits package in order to compete effectively in the hiring and retention of qualified employees. Our labor and benefit costs may continue to increase and such increases may not be recovered. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, COVID-19 increases the risk that certain senior executive officers or a member of the board of directors could become ill, causing them to be incapacitated or otherwise unable to perform their duties for an extended absence. Furthermore, because of the nature of the disease, multiple people working in close proximity could also become ill simultaneously which could result in the same department having extended absences. This could negatively impact the efficiency and effectiveness of processes and internal controls throughout the Company.\nETHAN ALLEN INTERIORS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur total assets include substantial amounts of long-lived assets. Changes to estimates or projections used to assess the fair value of these assets, financial results that are lower than current estimates at certain design center locations or determinations to close underperforming locations may cause us to incur future impairment charges, negatively affecting its financial results.\nWe make certain accounting estimates and projections with regard to individual design center operations as well as overall Company performance in connection with our impairment analysis for long-lived assets in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. An impairment charge may be required if the impairment analysis indicates that the carrying value of an asset exceeds the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows of the asset. The projection of future cash flows used in this analysis requires the use of judgment and a number of estimates and projections of future operating results. If actual results differ from Company estimates, additional charges for asset impairments may be required in the future. If impairment charges are significant, our financial results could be negatively affected.\nAccess to consumer credit could be interrupted as a result of conditions outside of our control, which could reduce sales and profitability.\nOur ability to continue to access consumer credit for our customers could be negatively affected by conditions outside our control. If capital market conditions have a material negative change, there is a risk that our business partner that issues our private label credit card program may not be able to fulfill its obligations under that agreement. In addition, the tightening of credit markets may restrict the ability and willingness of customers to make purchases.\nWe may not be able to maintain our current design center locations at current costs. We may also fail to successfully select and secure design center locations.\nOur design centers are typically located in busy urban settings as freestanding destinations or as part of suburban strip malls or shopping malls, depending upon the real estate opportunities in a particular market. Our business competes with other retailers and as a result, our success may be affected by our ability to renew current design center leases and to select and secure appropriate retail locations for existing and future design centers.\nOur business may be materially adversely affected by changes to tax policies.\nChanges in United States or international income tax laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business in the future or require us to modify our current business practices. In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to tax examinations by various governmental tax authorities. The global and diverse nature of our business means that there could be additional examinations by governmental tax authorities and the resolution of ongoing and other probable audits, which could impose a future risk to the results of our business.\nOur operations present hazards and risks which may not be fully covered by insurance, if insured.\nThe scope and nature of our operations present a variety of operational hazards and risks that must be managed through continual oversight and control. As protection against hazards and risks, we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from such risks. Uninsured losses and liabilities from operating risks could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property could materially adversely affect us.\nWe believe that our copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, and all of our other intellectual property are important to our success. We rely on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, and confidentiality and restricted use agreements, to protect our intellectual property and may seek licenses to intellectual property of others. Some of our intellectual property is not covered by any patent, trademark, or copyright or any applications for the same. We cannot provide assurance that agreements designed to protect our intellectual property will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any such breach, or that the efforts we take to protect our proprietary rights will be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights or failure to obtain licenses of intellectual property from third parties could harm our business or our ability to compete. Moreover, we cannot provide assurance that the use of our technology or proprietary \u201cknow-how\u201d or information does not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. If we have to litigate to protect or defend any of our rights, such litigation could result in significant expense.\nETHAN ALLEN INTERIORS INC.
