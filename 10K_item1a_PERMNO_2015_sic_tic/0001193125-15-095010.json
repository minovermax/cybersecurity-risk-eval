The following risk factors, issues and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating our future prospects. In particular, keep these risk factors in mind when you read \u201cforward-looking\u201d statements elsewhere in this report. Forward-looking statements relate to our expectations for future events and time periods. Generally, the words \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cpredicts,\u201d \u201cpotential,\u201d \u201ccontinue\u201d and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and future events and circumstances could differ significantly from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Any of the following risks could harm our business, operating results or financial condition and could result in a complete loss of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not yet identified or that we currently think are immaterial may also harm our business and financial condition in the future.\nOur ability to attract customers to our stores depends heavily on the success of the shopping malls in which many of our stores are located; any decrease in customer traffic in those malls could cause our sales to be less than expected.\nIn order to generate customer traffic we depend heavily on locating many of our stores in prominent locations within successful shopping malls. Sales at these stores are derived, in part, from the volume of traffic in those malls. Our stores benefit from the ability of a mall\u2019s other tenants to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores and the continuing popularity of malls as shopping destinations. Our sales volume and mall traffic generally may be adversely affected by, among other things, economic downturns in a particular area, competition from ecommerce retailers, non-mall retailers and other malls, increases in gasoline prices and the closing or decline in popularity of other stores in the malls in which we are located. An uncertain economic outlook could curtail new shopping mall development, decrease shopping mall traffic, reduce the number of hours that shopping mall operators keep their shopping malls open or force them to cease operations entirely. A reduction in mall traffic as a result of these or any other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur growth strategy depends on our ability to open and operate new stores each year, which could strain our resources and cause the performance of our existing stores to suffer.\nOur growth largely depends on our ability to open and operate new stores successfully. However, our ability to open new stores is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, and we may be unable to open new stores as planned, and any failure to successfully open and operate new stores could have a material adverse effect on our\nresults of operations. We intend to continue to open new stores in future years while remodeling a portion of our existing store base annually. In addition, our proposed expansion will place increased demands on our operational, managerial and administrative resources. These increased demands could cause us to operate our business less effectively, which in turn could cause deterioration in the financial performance of our individual stores and our overall business. To the extent our new store openings are in markets where we already have stores, we may experience reduced net sales in existing stores in those markets. In addition, successful execution of our growth strategy may require that we obtain additional financing, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain that financing on acceptable terms or at all.\nIn addition, we plan to open new stores in regions of the U.S. or international locations in which we currently have few, or no, stores. The expansion into these markets may present competitive, merchandising, hiring and distribution challenges that are different from those currently encountered in our existing markets. Any of these challenges could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nFailure to successfully integrate any businesses or stores that we acquire could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial performance.\nWe may, from time to time, acquire other retail stores or businesses, such as our acquisition of Blue Tomato, a leading European multi-channel retailer for board sports and related apparel and footwear, which was completed in fiscal 2012. We may experience difficulties in integrating any stores or businesses we may acquire, including their facilities, personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures, and any such acquisitions may also result in the diversion of our capital and our management\u2019s attention from other business issues and opportunities. If we experience difficulties in integrating acquisitions or if such acquisitions do not provide the benefits that we expect to receive, we could experience increased costs and other operating inefficiencies, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and overall financial performance.\nOur plans for international expansion include risks that could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nIn fiscal 2011, we opened our first store locations in Canada and we plan to continue to open new stores in Canada. During fiscal 2012, we acquired Blue Tomato, which operates primarily in the European market, and we plan to open new stores in Europe in the future. We may continue to expand internationally, either organically, or through additional acquisitions. International markets may have different competitive conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing U.S. market. As a result, operations in international markets may be less successful than our operations in the U.S. Additionally, consumers in international markets may not be familiar with us and the brands we sell, and we may need to build brand awareness in the markets. Furthermore, we have limited experience with the legal and regulatory environments and market practices outside of the U.S. and cannot guarantee that we will be able to penetrate or successfully operate in international markets. We also expect to incur additional costs in complying with applicable foreign laws and regulations as they pertain to both our products and our operations.\nAdditionally, the results of operations of our international subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon translation, operating results may differ materially from expectations. As we expand our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations will increase.\nOur business is dependent upon our being able to anticipate, identify and respond to changing fashion trends, customer preferences and other fashion-related factors; failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on us.\nCustomer tastes and fashion trends in the action sports lifestyle market are volatile and tend to change rapidly. Our success depends on our ability to effectively anticipate, identify and respond to changing fashion tastes and consumer preferences, and to translate market trends into appropriate, saleable product offerings in a\ntimely manner. If we are unable to successfully anticipate, identify or respond to changing styles or trends and misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines, our sales may be lower than predicted and we may be faced with a substantial amount of unsold inventory or missed opportunities. In response to such a situation, we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess or slow-moving inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe current uncertainty surrounding the U.S. and global economies, including the European economy, coupled with cyclical economic trends in action sports retailing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe action sports retail industry historically has been subject to substantial cyclicality. As the U.S. and global economic conditions change, the trends in discretionary consumer spending become unpredictable and discretionary consumer spending could be reduced due to uncertainties about the future. When discretionary consumer spending is reduced, purchases of action sports apparel and related products may decline. The current uncertainty in the U.S. and global economies and increased government debt may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nBecause of this cycle, we believe the \u201cvalue\u201d message has become more important to consumers. As a retailer that sells approximately 80% to 85% branded merchandise, this trend may negatively affect our business, as we generally will have to charge more than vertically integrated private label retailers.\nOur sales and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis, leaving our operating results particularly susceptible to changes in back-to-school and winter holiday shopping patterns. Accordingly, our quarterly results of operations are volatile and may fluctuate significantly.\nOur quarterly results of operations have fluctuated significantly in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. Our sales and profitability are typically disproportionately higher in the third and fourth fiscal quarters of each fiscal year due to increased sales during the back-to-school and winter holiday shopping seasons. Sales during these periods cannot be used as an accurate indicator of annual results. As a result of this seasonality, any factors negatively affecting us during the last half of the year, including unfavorable economic conditions, adverse weather or our ability to acquire seasonal merchandise inventory, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for the entire year. In addition, in order to prepare for the back-to-school and winter holiday shopping seasons, we must order and keep in stock significantly more merchandise than we carry during other times of the year. Any unanticipated decrease in demand for our products during these peak shopping seasons could require us to sell excess inventory at a substantial markdown, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur quarterly results of operations are affected by a variety of other factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe timing of new store openings and the relative proportion of our new stores to mature stores;\n\u2022\nwhether we are able to successfully integrate any new stores that we acquire and the presence of any unanticipated liabilities in connection therewith;\n\u2022\nfashion trends and changes in consumer preferences;\n\u2022\ncalendar shifts of holiday or seasonal periods;\n\u2022\nchanges in our merchandise mix;\n\u2022\ntiming of promotional events;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and, in particular, the retail sales environment;\n\u2022\nactions by competitors or mall anchor tenants;\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\nthe level of pre-opening expenses associated with our new stores; and\n\u2022\ninventory shrinkage beyond our historical average rates.\nSignificant fluctuations and volatility in the price of cotton, foreign labor costs and other raw materials used in the production of our merchandise may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions.\nIncreases in the cost of cotton, other raw materials, foreign labor costs and transportation costs used in the production of our merchandise can result in higher costs in the price we pay for this merchandise. The costs for cotton are affected by weather, consumer demand, speculation on the commodities market and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control. Our gross profit and results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent that the selling prices of our products do not increase proportionately with the increases in the costs of cotton or other materials. Increasing labor costs and oil-related product costs, such as manufacturing and transportation costs, could also adversely impact gross profit. Additionally, significant changes in the relationship between carrier capacity and shipper demand could increase transportation costs, which could also adversely impact gross profit.\nMost of our merchandise is produced by foreign manufacturers; therefore, the availability and costs of these products may be negatively affected by risks associated with international trade and other international conditions.\nMost of our merchandise is produced by manufacturers around the world. Some of these facilities are located in regions that may be affected by natural disasters, political instability or other conditions that could cause a disruption in trade. Trade restrictions such as increased tariffs or quotas, or both, could also increase the cost and reduce the supply of merchandise available to us. Any reduction in merchandise available to us or any increase in its cost due to tariffs, quotas or local issues that disrupt trade could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our business could be adversely affected by disruptions in the supply chain, such as strikes, work stoppages, or port closures. Although the prices charged by vendors for the merchandise we purchase are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, a decline in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to foreign currencies could lead to increased merchandise costs, which could negatively affect our competitive position and our results of operations.\nThe regulatory requirements regarding conflict minerals could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC promulgated final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals (tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten) known as conflict minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries, as well as procedures regarding a manufacturer\u2019s efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals. We conducted required due diligence activities for the 2013 calendar year and filed our first Form SD report with the SEC in June 2014. While the conflict minerals rule continues in effect as adopted, there remains uncertainty regarding how the conflict minerals rule, and our compliance obligations, will be affected in the future. Specifically, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit largely upheld the conflict minerals rule in April 2014, but in November 2014, it granted the SEC\u2019s and Amnesty International\u2019s petitions for rehearing regarding certain disclosure requirements of the rule. Additional requirements under the rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain of the conflict minerals used in the manufacture of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to purchase these products in the future. The costs of compliance, including those related to supply chain research, the limited number of suppliers and possible changes in the sourcing of these minerals, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flow.\nOur business is susceptible to weather conditions that are out of our control, including the potential risks of unpredictable weather patterns and any weather patterns associated with naturally occurring global climate change, and the resultant unseasonable weather could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nOur business is susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season (including\nany weather patterns associated with global warming and cooling) could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions. These prolonged unseasonable weather conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to compete favorably in the highly competitive retail industry, and if we lose customers to our competitors, our sales could decrease.\nThe teenage and young adult retail apparel, footwear, accessories and hardgoods industry is highly competitive. We compete with other retailers for vendors, teenage and young adult customers, suitable store locations, qualified store associates and management personnel. Some of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater financial, marketing, including advanced ecommerce marketing capabilities, and other resources than we do. Additionally, some of our competitors may offer more options for free and/or expedited shipping for ecommerce sales. Direct competition with these and other retailers may increase significantly in the future, which could require us, among other things, to lower our prices and could result in the loss of our customers. Current and increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to maintain good relationships with vendors or if a vendor is otherwise unable or unwilling to supply us with adequate quantities of their products at acceptable prices, our business and financial performance could suffer.\nOur business is dependent on continued good relations with our vendors. In particular, we believe that we generally are able to obtain attractive pricing and other terms from vendors because we are perceived as a desirable customer, and deterioration in our relationship with our vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that our vendors will provide us with an adequate supply or quality of products or acceptable pricing. Our vendors could discontinue selling to us, raise the prices they charge at any time or allow their merchandise to be discounted by other retailers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire desired merchandise in sufficient quantities on terms acceptable to us in the future. In addition, certain of our vendors sell their products directly to the retail market and therefore compete with us directly and other vendors may decide to do so in the future. There can be no assurance that such vendors will not decide to discontinue supplying their products to us, supply us only less popular or lower quality items, raise the prices they charge us or focus on selling their products directly. In addition, a number of our vendors are smaller, less capitalized companies and are more likely to be impacted by unfavorable general economic and market conditions than larger and better capitalized companies. These smaller vendors may not have sufficient liquidity during economic downturns to properly fund their businesses and their ability to supply their products to us could be negatively impacted. Any inability to acquire suitable merchandise at acceptable prices, or the loss of one or more key vendors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ecommerce operations subject us to numerous risks that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur ecommerce operations subject us to certain risks that could have an adverse effect on our operational results, including:\n\u2022\nrapid technological change;\n\u2022\nliability for online content; and\n\u2022\nrisks related to the computer systems that operate our website and related support systems, including computer viruses, electronic break-ins and similar disruptions.\nIn addition, risks beyond our control, such as governmental regulation of ecommerce, entry of our vendors in the ecommerce business in competition with us, online security breaches and general economic conditions specific to ecommerce could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf we lose key executives or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business, our financial performance could suffer.\nOur performance depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our key executives. If we lose the services of one or more of our key executives, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our growth objectives. As our business grows, we will need to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in a timely manner and we may not be able to do so.\nOur failure to meet our staffing needs could adversely affect our ability to implement our growth strategy and could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees who understand and appreciate our culture based on a passion for the action sports lifestyle and are able to adequately represent this culture to our customers. Qualified individuals of the requisite caliber, skills and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas, and the employee turnover rate in the retail industry is high. Competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of suitable employees. If we are unable to hire and retain store managers and store associates capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service, as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture and knowledge of our merchandise, our ability to open new stores may be impaired and the performance of our existing and new stores could be materially adversely affected. We are also dependent upon temporary personnel to adequately staff our stores and distribution and ecommerce fulfillment centers particularly during busy periods such as the back-to-school and winter holiday seasons. There can be no assurance that we will receive adequate assistance from our temporary personnel, or that there will be sufficient sources of temporary personnel. Although none of our employees are currently covered by collective bargaining agreements, we cannot guarantee that our employees will not elect to be represented by labor unions in the future, which could increase our labor costs and could subject us to the risk of work stoppages and strikes. Any such failure to meet our staffing needs, any material increases in employee turnover rates, any increases in labor costs or any work stoppages, interruptions or strikes could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nOur business could suffer with the closure or disruption of our home office or our distribution or ecommerce fulfillment centers.\nDomestically, we rely on a single distribution center located in Corona, California to receive, store and distribute the vast majority of our merchandise to our domestic stores and we primarily rely on a single ecommerce fulfillment center located in Edwardsville, Kansas to ship merchandise purchased on the www.zumiez.com website. Internationally, we operate a combined distribution and ecommerce fulfillment center located in Graz, Austria that support our Blue Tomato ecommerce and store operations in Europe and we operate a distribution center located in Delta, British Columbia, Canada to distribute our merchandise to our Canadian stores. Additionally, we are headquartered in Lynnwood, Washington. As a result, a natural disaster or other catastrophic event that affects one of the regions where we operate these centers could significantly disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are required to make substantial rental payments under our operating leases and any failure to make these lease payments when due could have a material adverse effect on our business and growth plans.\nPayments under operating leases account for a significant portion of our operating expenses and has historically been our third largest expense behind cost of sales and our employee related costs. Total rent expense, including contingent rent based on sales of some of our stores, was $72.5 million, $53.4 million and $50.0 million for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012. Total rent expense amounts do not include real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance charges and other executory costs, which were $39.6 million, $32.0 million and $28.0 million for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012.\nAt January 31, 2015, we were committed to property owners for minimum lease payments of $423.8 million. In addition to minimum lease payments, substantially all of our store leases provide for contingent rent payments\nbased on sales of the respective stores, as well as real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance charges and other executory costs. These amounts generally escalate each year. We expect that any new stores we open will also be leased by us under operating leases, which will further increase our operating lease expenses and obligations.\nOur substantial operating lease obligations could have significant negative consequences, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u2022\nrequiring that a substantial portion of our available cash be applied to pay our rental obligations, thus reducing cash available for other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or in the industry in which we compete, and placing us at a disadvantage with respect to some of our competitors.\nWe depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill our other cash needs. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities, and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us from borrowings under bank loans or from other sources, we may not be able to service our operating lease expenses, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe terms of our primary credit facility impose operating and financial restrictions on us that may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions. These restrictions could have a significant adverse impact on our business. Additionally, our business could suffer if our ability to acquire financing is reduced or eliminated.\nWe maintain a secured credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., which provides us with a secured revolving credit facility until September 1, 2016 of up to $25.0 million, which, pursuant to an accordion feature, may be increased to $35.0 million at our discretion. The credit agreement contains a number of restrictions and covenants that generally limit our ability to, among other things, (1) incur additional debt, (2) undergo a change in ownership and (3) enter into certain transactions. The credit agreement also contains financial covenants that require us to meet certain specified financial tests and ratios, including, a maximum net income after taxes of not less than one dollar on a trailing four-quarter basis provided, that, there shall be added to net income all charges for impairment of goodwill and other intangibles and up to an aggregate of $5.0 million of store asset impairment, and a minimum quick ratio of 1.25. The quick ratio is defined as our cash and near cash equivalents plus certain defined receivables divided by the borrowings outstanding. Our accounts receivable, general intangibles, inventory and equipment have been pledged to secure our obligations under the credit agreement. We must also provide financial information and statements to our lender. We were in compliance with all such covenants at January 31, 2015. There were no borrowings outstanding under the secured revolving credit facility at January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014. We had open commercial letters of credit outstanding under our secured revolving credit facility of $0.3 million at January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014.\nA breach of any of these restrictive covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial tests and ratios could result in a default under the credit agreement. If a default occurs, the lender may elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. If we are unable to repay borrowings outstanding when due, whether at their maturity or if declared due and payable by the lender following a default, the lender has the right to proceed against the collateral granted to it to secure the indebtedness. As a result, any breach of these covenants or failure to comply with these tests and ratios could have a material adverse effect on us. There can be no assurance that we will not breach the covenants or fail to comply with the tests and ratios in our credit agreement or any other debt agreements we may enter into in the future and, if a breach occurs, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary waivers or amendments from the lenders.\nThe restrictions contained in our credit agreement could: (1) limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans; and (2) adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, strategic acquisitions, investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\nAdditionally, in the current economic environment, we cannot be assured that our borrowing relationship with our lenders will continue or that our lenders will remain able to support their commitments to us in the future. If our lenders fail to do so, then we may not be able to secure alternative financing on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nOur business could suffer if a manufacturer fails to use acceptable labor practices.\nWe do not control our vendors or the manufacturers that produce the products we buy from them, nor do we control the labor practices of our vendors and these manufacturers. The violation of labor or other laws by any of our vendors or these manufacturers, or the divergence of the labor practices followed by any of our vendors or these manufacturers from those generally accepted as ethical in the U.S., could interrupt, or otherwise disrupt, the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation. Any of these, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In that regard, most of the products we sell are manufactured overseas, primarily in Asia and Central America, which may increase the risk that the labor practices followed by the manufacturers of these products may differ from those considered acceptable in the U.S.\nAdditionally, our products are subject to regulation of and regulatory standards set by various governmental authorities with respect to quality and safety. Regulations and standards in this area are currently in place. These regulations and standards may change from time to time. Our inability to comply on a timely basis with regulatory requirements could result in significant fines or penalties, which could adversely affect our reputation and sales. Issues with the quality and safety of merchandise we sell, regardless of our culpability, or customer concerns about such issues, could result in damage to our reputation, lost sales, uninsured product liability claims or losses, merchandise recalls and increased costs.\nOur failure to adequately anticipate a correct mix of private label merchandise may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSales from private label merchandise account for approximately 15% to 20% of our net sales and generally carry higher gross margins than our other merchandise. We may take steps to increase the percentage of net sales of private label merchandise in the future, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve increases in private label merchandise sales as a percentage of net sales. Our failure to anticipate, identify and react in a timely manner to fashion trends with our private label merchandise, could have a material adverse effect on our comparable sales, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our information systems hardware or software fails to function effectively or does not scale to keep pace with our planned growth, our operations could be disrupted and our financial results could be harmed.\nWe are continuing to make investments to improve our information systems infrastructure. If our information systems and software do not work effectively, this could adversely impact the promptness and accuracy of our transaction processing, financial accounting and reporting and our ability to manage our business and properly forecast operating results and cash requirements. Additionally, we rely on third-party service providers for certain information systems functions. If a service provider fails to provide the data quality, communications capacity or services we require, the failure could interrupt our services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To manage the anticipated growth of our operations and personnel, we may need to continue to improve our operational and financial systems, transaction processing, procedures and controls, and in doing so could incur substantial additional expenses that could impact our financial results.\nThe security of our databases that contain personal information of our retail customers could be breached, which could subject us to adverse publicity, litigation and expenses. In addition, if we are unable to comply with security standards created by the credit card industry, our operations could be adversely affected.\nDatabase privacy, network security and identity theft are matters of growing public concern. In an attempt to prevent unauthorized access to our network and databases containing confidential, third-party information, we have installed privacy protection systems, devices and activity monitoring on our networks. Nevertheless, if unauthorized parties gain access to our networks or databases, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify our private and sensitive third-party information. In such circumstances, we could be held liable to our customers or other parties or be subject to regulatory or other actions for breaching privacy rules and we may be exposed to reputation damage and loss of customers\u2019 trust and business. This could result in costly investigations and litigation, civil or criminal penalties and adverse publicity that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and reputation. Further, if we are unable to comply with the security standards established by banks and the credit card industry, we may be subject to fines, restrictions and expulsion from card acceptance programs, which could adversely affect our retail operations.\nOur inability or failure to protect our intellectual property or our infringement of other\u2019s intellectual property could have a negative impact on our operating results.\nWe believe that our trademarks and domain names are valuable assets that are critical to our success. The unauthorized use or other misappropriation of our trademarks or domain names could diminish the value of the Zumiez or Blue Tomato brands, our store concepts, our private label brands or our goodwill and cause a decline in our net sales. Although we have secured or are in the process of securing protection for our trademarks and domain names in a number of countries outside of the U.S., there are certain countries where we do not currently have or where we do not currently intend to apply for protection for certain trademarks or at all. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our trademarks may not be sufficient or effective. Therefore, we may not be able to prevent other persons from using our trademarks or domain names outside of the U.S., which also could adversely affect our business. We are also subject to the risk that we may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties. Any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product delays or require us to pay royalties or license fees. As a result, any such claim could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nThe effects of war or acts of terrorism, or other types of mall violence, could adversely affect our business.\nMost of our stores are located in shopping malls. Any threat of terrorist attacks or actual terrorist events, or other types of mall violence, such as shootings in malls, particularly in public areas, could lead to lower customer traffic in shopping malls. In addition, local authorities or mall management could close shopping malls in response to security concerns. Mall closures, as well as lower customer traffic due to security concerns, could result in decreased sales. Additionally, the armed conflicts in the Middle East, or the threat, escalation or commencement of war or other armed conflict elsewhere, could significantly diminish consumer spending, and result in decreased sales for us. Decreased sales could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe outcome of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, and may result in substantial costs and could divert management\u2019s attention.\nWe are involved, from time to time, in litigation incidental to our business including complaints filed by investors. This litigation could result in substantial costs, and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business. Risks associated with legal liability are often difficult to assess or quantify, and their existence and magnitude can remain unknown for significant periods of time. There can be no assurance that the actual outcome of pending or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, while we maintain director and officer liability insurance for litigation surrounding investor lawsuits, the amount of insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover a claim and the continued availability of this insurance cannot be assured.\nOur operations expose us to the risk of litigation, which could lead to significant potential liability and costs that could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe employ a substantial number of full-time and part-time employees, a majority of whom are employed at our store locations. As a result, we are subject to a large number of federal, state and foreign laws and regulations relating to employment. This creates a risk of potential claims that we have violated laws related to discrimination and harassment, health and safety, wage and hour laws, criminal activity, personal injury and other claims. We are also subject to other types of claims in the ordinary course of our business. Some or all of these claims may give rise to litigation, which could be time-consuming for our management team, costly and harmful to our business.\nIn addition, we are exposed to the risk of class action litigation. The costs of defense and the risk of loss in connection with class action suits are greater than in single-party litigation claims. Due to the costs of defending against such litigation, the size of judgments that may be awarded against us, and the loss of significant management time devoted to such litigation, we cannot assure you that such litigation will not disrupt our business or impact our financial results.\nOur failure to comply with federal, state, local or foreign laws, or changes in these laws, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial performance.\nOur business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations. Changes in the regulations, the imposition of additional regulations, or the enactment of any new legislation including those related to health care, taxes, privacy, environmental issues and trade, could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs, including costs related to an increase in the minimum wage and new health care laws.\nLabor is a primary component in the cost of operating our business. Increased labor costs, whether due to competition, unionization, increased minimum wage, state unemployment rates, employee benefits costs or otherwise, may adversely impact our operating expenses. A considerable amount of our store team members are paid at rates related to the federal or state minimum wage and any changes to the minimum wage rate may increase our operating expenses. Additionally, we are self-insured with respect to our health care coverage in the U.S. and do not purchase third party insurance for the health insurance benefits provided to employees with the exception of pre-defined stop loss coverage, which helps limit the cost of large claims. In March 2010, The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was enacted requiring employers such as us to provide health insurance for all qualifying employees or pay penalties for not providing coverage. The most significant increases in cost will occur in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016. We evaluated the impact the new law will have on us, and although we cannot predict with certainty the financial and operational impacts the new law will have, we expect to be required to provide health benefits to more employees than we currently do, which we expect to raise our labor costs. While the majority of these costs will begin in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016, there is no assurance that we will be able to absorb and/or pass through the costs of such legislation in a manner that will not adversely impact our results or operations.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses as a result of being a public company, which will negatively impact our financial performance.\nWe completed our initial public offering in May 2005 and we have incurred and could continue to incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses as a result of being a public company. Rules and regulations implemented by Congress, the SEC and the Nasdaq Global Select Market have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. Compliance with these laws could cause us to incur significant costs and expenses, including legal and accounting costs, and could make some compliance activities more time-consuming and negatively impact our financial performance. Additionally, these rules and regulations may make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as officers.\nFailure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in our financial reporting and could harm our ability to manage our expenses.\nReporting obligations as a public company and our anticipated growth, both domestically and internationally, are likely to place a considerable strain on our financial and management systems, processes and controls, as well as on our personnel. In addition, we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 so that our management can certify as to the effectiveness of our internal controls and our independent registered public accounting firm can render an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. This process requires us to document our internal controls over financial reporting and to potentially make significant changes thereto, if applicable. As a result, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial expenses to test our financial controls and systems, and we have been and in the future may be required to improve our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures, to incur substantial expenses to make such improvements and to hire additional personnel. If our management is ever unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are ever identified, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our stock price. In addition, if we do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis, which could cause a decline in our stock price and adversely affect our ability to raise capital.\nChanges to accounting rules or regulations could significantly affect our financial results.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). New accounting rules or regulations and changes to existing accounting rules or regulations have occurred and may occur in the future. Future changes to accounting rules or regulations, such as changes to lease accounting guidance or a requirement to convert to international financial reporting standards, could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition through increased cost of compliance.\nWe may fail to meet analyst expectations, which could cause the price of our stock to decline.\nOur common stock is traded publicly and various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These reports include information about our historical financial results as well as the analysts\u2019 estimates of our future performance. The analysts\u2019 estimates are based upon their own independent opinions and can be different from our estimates or expectations. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline. In December 2007, a securities class action litigation and associated derivative lawsuits were brought against us and such actions are frequently brought against other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities. These lawsuits were dismissed with prejudice in March 2009. If our stock price is volatile, we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.\nThe value of our investments may fluctuate.\nWe have our excess cash primarily invested in state and local municipal securities and variable-rate demand notes. These investments have historically been considered very safe investments with minimal default rates. At January 31, 2015, we had $138.2 million of investments in state and local government securities and variable-rate demand notes. These securities are not guaranteed by the U.S. government and are subject to additional credit risk based upon each local municipality\u2019s tax revenues and financial stability. As a result, we may experience a reduction in value or loss of liquidity of our investments, which may have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nA decline in the market price of our stock and/or our performance may trigger an impairment of the goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded on the consolidated balance sheets.\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if management believes indicators of impairment exist. Any reduction in the carrying value of our goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets as a result of our impairment analysis could result in a non-cash impairment charge, which could have a significant impact on our results of operations.\nReduced operating results and cash flows may cause us to incur impairment charges.\nWe review the carrying value of our fixed assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable. The review could result in a non-cash impairment charge related to underperforming stores, which could impact our results of operations.", "PERMNO": 90715, "SIC": 5651, "TIC": "ZUMZ"}
