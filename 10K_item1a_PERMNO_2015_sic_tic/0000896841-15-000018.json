{"cik": "896841", "company": "AVID TECHNOLOGY, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K before making an investment decision regarding our common stock. If any of the following risks were to actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results would likely suffer, possibly materially, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nIf we are unable to successfully execute on our strategy, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are in the process of transforming our business based on a strategy built on three pillars, Avid Everywhere, The Avid Advantage and the Avid Customer Association. As part of our corporate strategy we have organized our products in three suites, all built upon our MediaCentral Platform. The ongoing implementation of some of our strategy may require additional capital that we may not have access to on reasonable terms or at all. Additionally, our strategy is requiring us to develop expertise in new areas and establish new competencies either through talent acquisition or internal development, which we may not be able to successfully achieve. Moreover, the pace and scope of the transformation contemplated in our strategy increases the risk that not all of our strategic plans will deliver the expected benefits within the anticipated time frames, or at all. Furthermore, as a part of our strategy we are also identifying and executing on opportunities to reduce operating costs. If we are unable successfully to execute on our strategy, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets, and our competitors may be able to draw upon a greater depth and breadth of resources than those that are available to us.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets characterized by pressure to innovate, expand feature sets and functionality, accelerate new product releases and reduce prices. Markets for certain of our products also have limited barriers to entry. There is an additional risk of consolidation among our competitors, which could result in fewer, more effective competitors. Customers consider many factors when evaluating our products relative to those of our competitors, including innovation, ease of use, price, feature sets, functionality, reliability, performance, reputation, and training and support, and we may not compare favorably against our competitors in all respects. Our restatement process may have had a negative impact on our reputation among our customers. Some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition and substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution and support resources than we do. As a result, they may be able to deliver greater innovation, respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in market demand, devote more resources to the development, marketing and sale of their products, successfully expand into emerging and other international markets, or price their products more aggressively than we can.\nIf our competitors are more successful than we are in developing products or in attracting and retaining customers, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe rapid evolution of the media industry is changing our customers\u2019 needs, businesses and revenue models, and if we cannot anticipate or adapt quickly, our business will be harmed.\nThe media industry has rapidly and dramatically transformed over the past few years and is continuing to do so as free content, minimal entry costs for creation and distribution, and the expansion of mobile devices have become prevalent. As a result, our traditional customers\u2019 needs, businesses and revenue models are changing, often in ways that deviate from our core strengths and traditional bases. If we cannot anticipate these changes or adapt to them quickly, our business will be harmed. For example, our customers have to address the increasing digitization of the media industry, which requires the creation of a more seamless value chain between content creation and monetization. Furthermore, because of the consumerization of the media industry, there is more pressure to create media that can be repurposed in a variety of ways in an efficient manner. As a result of these industry changes, traditional advertising channels are also facing competition from web and mobile platforms and diminished revenues from traditional advertising will cause some customers\u2019 budgets for the purchase of our solutions to decline; this may be particularly true among local television stations, which in the past have been an important customer industry for us. Additionally,\nour customers may also seek to pool or share facilities and resources with others in their industry and engage with providers of software as a service.\nWe continually assess new products and solutions for our customers and we continue to implement our Avid Everywhere strategy and platform designed to address changes in the industry by offering an open platform that will enable people to connect, collaborate, store, manage, distribute, share and monetize media assets; however, the changes in the industry may reduce demand for some of our existing products and services. Our competitive landscape continues to evolve as the media industry rapidly evolves. New or non-traditional competitors may arise or adapt in response to this evolution of the media industry, which could create downward price pressure on our products and solutions and reduce our market share and revenue opportunities.\nOur success depends in significant part on our ability to provide innovative products and solutions in response to dynamic and rapidly evolving market demand.\nTo succeed in our market, we must deliver innovative products and solutions. Innovation requires both that we accurately predict future market trends and customer expectations and that we quickly adapt our development efforts in response. We also have the challenge of protecting our product roadmap and new product initiatives from leaks to competitors that might reduce or eliminate any innovative edge that we seek to gain. Predicting market trends is difficult, as our market is dynamic and rapidly evolving. Additionally, given the complex, sophisticated nature of our solutions and our typically lengthy product development cycles, we may not be able to rapidly change our product direction or strategic course. If we are unable to accurately predict market trends or adapt to evolving market conditions, our ability to capture customer demand will suffer and our market reputation and financial performance will be negatively affected. Even to the extent we make accurate predictions and possess the requisite flexibility to adapt, we may be able to pursue only a handful of possible innovations as a result of limited resources. Our success, therefore, further depends on our ability to identify and focus on the most promising innovations.\nWhen we do introduce new products, our success depends on our ability to manage a number of risks associated with new products including but not limited to timely and successful product launch, market acceptance, and the availability of products in appropriate locations, quantities and costs to meet demand. For example, we have focused a significant part of our development efforts on developing our Avid Everywhere Platform, discussed in the preceding risk factor. There can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful in the near future, or at all, or that our competitors will not take significant market share in similar efforts. If we fail to develop new products and to manage new product introductions and transitions properly, our financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nOur international operations expose us to legal, regulatory and other risks that we may not face in the United States.\nWe derive more than half of our revenues from customers outside of the United States, and we rely on foreign contractors for the supply and manufacture of many of our products. We also conduct significant research and development activities overseas, including through third-party development vendors. For example, a significant part of our research and development is outsourced to contractors operating in Kiev, Ukraine and Thailand and we are in the process of expanding our own development activities to Taiwan and the Philippines. Our international operations are subject to a variety of risks that we may not face in the United States, including:\n\u2022\nthe financial and administrative burdens associated with compliance with a myriad of environmental, tax and export laws, as well as other business regulations in foreign jurisdictions, including high compliance costs, inconsistencies among jurisdictions, and a lack of administrative or judicial interpretative guidance;\n\u2022\nreduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022\nregional economic downturns;\n\u2022\neconomic, social and political instability abroad and international security concerns in general;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nlonger collection cycles for accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing contracts;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing and staffing international implementations and operations, and executing our business strategy internationally;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added or other tax systems and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the applicable laws and regulations, including, for example, the EU Data Protection Directive, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and the U.K. Bribery Act, particularly in emerging market countries;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in maintaining effective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls;\n\u2022\ncosts and delays associated with developing products in multiple languages; and\n\u2022\nforeign exchange controls that may prevent or limit our ability to repatriate income earned in foreign markets.\nOur overall success in international markets depends, in part, on our ability to succeed in differing legal, regulatory, economic, social and political conditions. We may not be successful in developing, implementing or maintaining policies and strategies that will be effective in managing these risks in each country where we do business. Our failure to manage these risks successfully, including developing appropriate contingency plans for our outsourced research and development work, could harm our international operations, reduce our international sales and increase our costs, thus adversely affecting our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe have a significant relationship with a development vendor operating in Kiev, Ukraine and manufacturing vendors operating in China and Thailand, and changes to those relationships may result in delays or disruptions that could harm our business.\nWe rely on an offshore software development vendor for developing and servicing our products primarily from its offices in Kiev, Ukraine and manufacturing vendors for manufacturing certain of our products and developing hardware primarily in China and Thailand. If one of those vendors were, for any reason, to cease or experience significant disruptions in its operations, among others as a result of political unrest, we might be unable to replace it on a timely basis with a comparably priced provider. We would also have to expend time and resources to train any new development or manufacturing vendor. If any of the vendors were to suffer an interruption in its business, or experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems in development or manufacturing operations, or if we had to change development or manufacturing vendors, our ability to provide services to our customers would be delayed and our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nWe operate in many different jurisdictions and we could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws.\nThe FCPA, and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from offering, promising, authorizing, or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of such official in his or her official capacity, inducing the official to do any act in violation of his or her lawful duty, or to secure any improper advantage in obtaining or retaining business. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws, with more frequent voluntary self-disclosures by companies, aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the DOJ and the SEC resulting in record fines and penalties, increased enforcement activity by non-U.S. regulators, and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals.\nOur internal policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. We operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental corruption problems to some degree and where local customs and practices may not foster strict compliance with anti-corruption laws. Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States could increase the risk of such violations in the future. Despite our training and compliance programs, we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from unauthorized reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations or financial condition.\nFailure of our information systems or breaches of data security could impact our business.\nOur systems and processes involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of employees, customers and others. In addition, we rely on information systems controlled by third parties. Information system failures, network disruptions and system and data security breaches, manipulation, destruction or leakage, whether intentional or accidental, could harm our ability to conduct our business, impede development, manufacture or shipment of products, interrupt or delay processing of transactions and reporting financial results or result in the unintentional disclosure of proprietary, sensitive or confidential information. With our development of Avid Everywhere with its public and private marketplaces and cloud based offerings, our and our customer\u2019s data and financial and proprietary information could\nbecome more susceptible to such failures and data breaches. Additionally, significant or repeated reductions in the performance, reliability, security or availability of our information systems and network infrastructure could significantly harm our brand and reputation and ability to attract and retain existing and potential users, customers, advertisers and content providers.\nSuch information system failures or unauthorized access could be caused by our failure to adequately maintain and enhance these systems and networks, external theft or attack, misconduct by our employees, contractors, or vendors, or many other causes such as power failures, earthquake, fire or other natural disasters. Such information system failures or unauthorized access could expose us, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and potential liability for us. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant.\nAdditionally, the Avid Everywhere cloud based offerings depend on the availability and proper functioning of certain third-party services, including but not limited to cloud provider, database management, backup, monitoring and logging services. The failure or improper functioning of these third party services could lead to outages, security breaches and data losses, including loss of customer creative assets. If third-party services become unavailable, we may need to expend considerable resources identifying and integrating alternate providers.\nOur engagement of contractors for product development and manufacturing may reduce our control over those activities, provide uncertain cost savings and expose our proprietary assets to greater risk of misappropriation.\nWe outsource a portion of our software development and our hardware design and manufacturing to contractors, both domestic and offshore. These relationships provide us with more flexible resource capabilities, access to global talent and cost savings, but also expose us to risks that may not exist or may be less pronounced with respect to our internal operations. We are able to exercise only limited oversight of our contractors, including with respect to their engineering and manufacturing processes, resource allocations, delivery schedules, security procedures and quality control. Language, cultural and time zone differences complicate effective management of contractors that are located abroad. Additionally, competition for talent in certain locations may lead to high turnover rates that disrupt development or manufacturing continuity. The manufacturers we use also manufacture products for other companies, including our competitors. Our contractors could choose to prioritize capacity for other users, increase the prices they charge us or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturing suppliers suffer any damage to facilities, lose benefits under material agreements, experience power outages, lack sufficient capacity to manufacture our products, encounter financial difficulties or are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers, or suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. Pricing terms offered by contractors may be highly variable over time reflecting, among other things, order volume, local inflation and exchange rates. For example, during the past few years, including in 2014, most of our outsourced manufacturers have been in China, where the cost of manufacturing has been increasing and labor unrest and turn-over rates at manufacturers have been on the rise. Some of our contractor relationships are based on contract, while others operate on a purchase order basis, where we do not have the benefit of written protections with respect to pricing or other critical terms.\nMany of our contractors require access to our intellectual property and our confidential and proprietary information to perform their services. Protection of these assets in relevant offshore locations may be less robust than in the United States. We must rely on policies and procedures we have instituted with our contractors and certain confidentiality and contractual provisions in our written agreements, to the extent they exist, for protection. These safeguards may be inadequate to prevent breaches. If a breach were to occur, available legal or other remedies may be limited or otherwise insufficient to compensate us for any resulting damages.\nCertain of our contractor relationships involve complex and mission-critical dependencies. If any of the preceding risks were to occur, we might not be able to rapidly wind down these relationships or quickly transition to alternative providers.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to hire and retain competent and skilled management and technical, sales and other personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the continued service and performance of our management team and key technical, sales and other personnel and our success will depend in part on our ability to retain these employees in a competitive job market. If we fail to appropriately match the skill sets of our employees to our needs we may incur increased costs or experience challenges with execution of our strategic plan. We rely on cash bonuses and equity awards as significant compensation and retention tools for key personnel. In addition to compensation, we seek to foster an innovative work culture to retain employees. We also rely on the attractiveness of developing technology for the film, television and music industries as a means of retention. We continue to take actions to transform strategically, operationally and culturally and to achieve cost savings, all with the intent to drive improved operating performance both in the U.S and internationally. The uncertainty inherent in our transformational strategy and the resulting workload and stress may make it difficult to attract and retain key personnel and increase turnover of key officers and employees.\nOur competitors may in some instances be able to offer a more established or more dynamic work environment, higher compensation or more opportunities to work with cutting-edge technology than we can. If we are unable to retain our key personnel or appropriately match skill sets with our needs, we would be required to expend significant time and financial resources to identify and hire new qualified personnel and to transfer significant internal historical knowledge, which might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.\nPotential acquisitions could be difficult to consummate and integrate into our operations, and they and investment transactions could disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or impair our financial results.\nAs part of our business strategy, from time to time we may acquire companies, technologies and products that we believe can improve our ability to compete in our existing customer markets or allow us to enter new markets. We may also pursue strategic investments. The potential risks associated with acquisitions and investment transactions include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nfailure to realize anticipated returns on investment, cost savings and synergies;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in assimilating the operations, policies and personnel of the acquired company;\n\u2022\nchallenges in combining product offerings and entering into new markets in which we may not have experience;\n\u2022\ndistraction of management\u2019s attention from normal business operations;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees of the acquired company;\n\u2022\ndifficulty implementing effective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures;\n\u2022\nimpairment of relationships with customers or suppliers;\n\u2022\npossibility of incurring impairment losses related to goodwill and intangible assets; and\n\u2022\nunidentified issues not discovered in due diligence, which may include product quality issues or legal or other contingencies.\nIn order to complete an acquisition or investment transaction, we may need to obtain financing, including through the incurrence of borrowings or the issuance of debt or equity securities. This could potentially dilute stockholder value for existing stockholders. We may borrow to finance an acquisition, and the amount and terms of any potential future acquisition-related borrowings, as well as other factors, could affect our liquidity and financial condition and potentially our credit ratings. We may not be able to consummate such financings on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, in which case our ability to complete desired acquisitions or investments and to implement our business strategy, and as a result our financial results, may be materially impaired. In addition, our effective tax rate on an ongoing basis is uncertain, and business combinations and investment transactions could impact our effective tax rate. We may experience risks relating to the challenges and costs of closing a business combination or investment transaction and the risk that an announced business combination or investment transaction may not close. As a result, any completed, pending or future transactions may contribute to financial results that differ from the investment community\u2019s expectations in a given quarter.\nWe obtain hardware product components and finished goods under sole-source supply arrangements, and any disruptions to these arrangements could jeopardize the manufacturing or distribution of certain of our hardware products.\nAlthough we generally prefer to establish multi-source supply arrangements for our hardware product components and finished goods, multi-source arrangements are not always possible or cost-effective. We consequently depend on sole-source suppliers for certain hardware product components and finished goods, including some critical items. We do not generally carry significant inventories of, and may not in all cases have guaranteed supply arrangements for, these sole-sourced items. If any of our sole-source suppliers were to cease, suspend or otherwise limit production or shipment (due to, among other things, macroeconomic events, political crises or natural or environmental disasters or other occurrences), or adversely modify supply terms or pricing,\nour ability to manufacture, distribute and service our products may be impaired and our business could be harmed. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain sole-sourced components or finished goods, or acceptable substitutes, from alternative suppliers or that we will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms. We may also be required to expend significant development resources to redesign our products to work around the exclusion of any sole-sourced component or accommodate the inclusion of any substitute component.\nWe depend on the availability and proper functioning of certain third-party technology that we incorporate into or bundle with our products. Third-party technology may include defects or errors that could adversely affect the performance of our products. If third-party technology becomes unavailable, we may need to expend considerable resources integrating alternative third-party technology or developing our own substitute technology.\nWe license third-party technology for incorporation into or bundling with our products. This technology may provide us with critical or strategic feature sets or functionality. The profit margin for each of our products depends in part on the royalty, license and purchase fees we pay in connection with third-party technology. To the extent we add additional third-party technology to our products and we are unable to offset associated costs, our profit margins may decline and our operating results may suffer. In addition to cost implications, third-party technology may include defects or errors that could adversely affect the performance of our products, which may harm our market reputation or adversely affect our product sales. Third-party technology may also include certain open source software code that if used in combination with our own software may jeopardize our intellectual property rights or limit our ability to sell through certain sales channels. If any third-party technology license expires, is terminated or ceases to be available on commercially reasonable terms, we may be required to expend considerable resources integrating alternative third-party technology or developing our own substitute technology. In the interim, sales of our products may be delayed or suspended or we may be forced to distribute our products with reduced feature sets or functionality.\nLengthy procurement lead times and unpredictable life cycles and customer demand for some of our products may result in significant inventory risks.\nWith respect to many of our products, particularly our audio products, we must procure component parts and build finished inventory far in advance of product shipments. Certain of these products may have unpredictable life cycles and encounter rapid technological obsolescence as a result of dynamic market conditions. We procure product components and build inventory based upon our forecasts of product life cycle and customer demand. If we are unable to accurately forecast product life cycle and customer demand or unable to manage our inventory levels in response to shifts in customer demand, the result may be insufficient, excess or obsolete product inventory. Insufficient product inventory may impair our ability to fulfill product orders and negatively affect our revenues, while excess or obsolete inventory may require a write-down on products and components to their net realizable value, which would negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur revenues and operating results depend significantly on our third-party reseller and distribution channels. Our failure to adequately manage the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins and therefore our profitability.\nWe distribute many of our products indirectly through third-party resellers and distributors. We also distribute products directly to end-user customers. Successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer industries for our products and services is a complex process. For example, in response to our direct sales strategies or for other business reasons, our current resellers and distributors may from time to time choose to resell our competitors\u2019 products in addition to, or in place of, ours. Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins, our failure to identify and implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins and therefore our profitability.\nIn addition, some of our resellers and distributors have rights of return, as well as inventory stock rotation and price protection. Accordingly, reserves for estimated returns and exchanges, and credits for price protection, are recorded as a reduction of revenues upon applicable product shipment, and are based upon our historical experience. Our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce visibility to demand and pricing issues, and therefore make forecasting more difficult and, to the extent that returns exceed estimates, our revenues and operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to achieve the efficiencies, savings and other benefits anticipated from our cost reduction, margin improvement and other business optimization initiatives.\nWe are continually reviewing and implementing programs throughout the company to reduce costs, increase efficiencies and enhance our business. We have in the past undertaken and expect to continue to undertake various restructuring activities and cost reduction initiatives in an effort to better align our organizational structure and costs with our strategy. In connection with these activities, we may experience a disruption in our ability to perform functions important to our strategy. Unexpected delays, increased costs, challenges with adapting our internal control environment to a new organizational structure, inability to retain and motivate employees or other challenges arising from these initiatives could adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated savings or other intended benefits of these activities and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nOur products may experience quality issues that could negatively impact our customer relationships, our market reputation and our operating results.\nOur software products, as is typical of sophisticated, complex software, occasionally include coding defects or errors (commonly referred to as \u201cbugs\u201d), which in some cases may interfere with or impair a customer\u2019s ability to operate or use the software. Similarly, our hardware products could include design or manufacturing defects that could cause them to malfunction. Although we employ quality control measures, those measures are not designed or intended to detect and remedy all defects. The time and resources available to devote to quality control measures are, in part, dependent on other business considerations, such as meeting customer expectations with respect to release schedules. Any product defects could result in loss of customers or revenues, delays in revenue recognition, increased product returns, damage to our market reputation and significant warranty or other expense and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nOur intellectual property and trade secrets are valuable assets that may be subject to third-party infringement and misappropriation.\nAs a technology company, our intellectual property and trade secrets are among our most valuable assets. Infringement or misappropriation of these assets results in lost revenues to us and thereby ultimately reduces their value. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and anti-piracy technology in certain of our products to protect our intellectual property and trade secrets. Most of these tools require vigilant monitoring of competitor and other third-party activities and of end-user usage of our products to be effective. These tools may not provide adequate protection in all instances, may be subject to circumvention, or may require a vigilance that in some cases exceeds our capabilities or resources. Additionally, our business model is increasingly focused on software products and as we offer more software products our revenues may be more vulnerable to loss through piracy, which could result in revenue losses for us. While we may seek to engage with those potentially infringing our intellectual property to negotiate a license for use, we also may seek legal recourse. The legal regimes of certain countries in which we operate may not protect our intellectual property or trade secrets to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Regardless of jurisdiction, assuming legal protection exists and infringement or misappropriation is detected, any enforcement action that we may pursue could be costly and time-consuming, the outcome will be uncertain, and the alleged offender in some cases may seek to have our intellectual property rights invalidated. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property and trade secrets, our business could be harmed.\nOur results could be materially adversely affected if we are accused of, or found to be, infringing third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights.\nBecause of technological change in our industry, extensive and sometimes uncertain patent coverage, and the rapid issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain of our products or business methods may infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Companies in the technology industry own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. We have received claims and are subject to litigation alleging that we infringe patents owned by third parties and may in the future be the subject to such claims and litigation. Regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or the merits of any patent claims by potential or actual litigants, we could incur substantial costs in defending intellectual property claims and litigation, and such claims and litigation could distract management\u2019s attention from normal business operations. In addition, we provide indemnification provisions in\nagreements with certain customers covering potential claims by third parties of intellectual property infringement. These agreements generally provide that we will indemnify customers for losses incurred in connection with an infringement claim brought by a third party with respect to our products, and we have received claims for such indemnification. The results of any intellectual property litigation to which we are, or may become, a party, or for which we are required to provide indemnification, may require us to:\n\u2022\ncease selling or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022\nmake substantial payments for legal fees, settlement payments or other costs or damages;\n\u2022\nobtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms, to sell or use the relevant technology, which such license could require royalties that would significantly increase our cost of goods sold; or\n\u2022\nredesign products or services to avoid infringement, which such redesign could involve significant costs and result in delayed and/or reduced sales of the affected products.\nIf we are unable to sell our professional products through retail sales channels, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nFollowing the divestiture of certain of our consumer product lines in July 2012, we continue to have a presence in retail because our professional-level products are offered through specialty retail stores. Our ability to continue to sell our professional products through certain retail sales channels may be impaired because we will sell fewer types of products and fewer units through those channels, impacting retailers\u2019 willingness to carry our professional-level products.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax provisions, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge for inventory, services, licenses and other items in intercompany transactions. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid upon the resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision, net income and cash flows. In addition, our tax provision in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process.\nWe may be the subject of litigation, which, if adversely determined, could harm our business and operating results.\nWe may be subject to claims arising in the normal course of business. The costs of defending any litigation, whether in cash expenses or in management time, could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our operating results and cash flows. An unfavorable outcome on any litigation matter could require that we pay substantial damages, or, in connection with any intellectual property infringement claims, could require that we pay ongoing royalty payments or prohibit us from selling certain of our products. In addition, we may decide to settle any litigation, which could cause us to incur significant settlement costs. A settlement or an unfavorable outcome on any litigation matter could have a material and adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nA natural disaster or catastrophic event may significantly limit our ability to conduct business as normal and harm our business.\nOur operations and the operations of our customers are vulnerable to interruptions by natural disasters or catastrophic events. For example, we operate a complex, geographically dispersed business, which includes significant personnel, customers and facilities presence in California near major earthquake fault lines. We may not be able to protect our company from such catastrophic events and we are predominantly uninsured for business continuity losses and disruptions caused by catastrophic events. Disruption or failure of our or our customers\u2019 networks or systems, or injury or damage to either parties\u2019 personnel or physical infrastructure, caused by a natural disaster, public health crisis, terrorism, cyber attack, act of war or other catastrophic event may significantly limit our or our customers\u2019 ability to conduct business as normal, including our ability to communicate and transact with customers, suppliers, distributors and resellers, which may negatively affect our revenues and operating results.\nAdditionally, a natural disaster or catastrophic event could cause us or our customers to suspend all or a portion of operations for a significant period of time, result in a permanent loss of resources, and require the relocation of personnel and material to alternate facilities that may not be available or adequate. Such an event could also cause an indirect economic impact on our customers, which could impact our customers\u2019 purchasing decisions and reduce demand for our products and services. A prolonged disruption of our business could also damage our reputation, particularly among our global news organization customers who are likely to require our solutions and support during such time. Any of these factors could cause a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Liquidity and Financial Performance\nA significant decrease in our liquidity could negatively affect our business.\nMaintaining adequate liquidity is important to our business operations. We meet our liquidity needs primarily through cash generated by operations, which we have supplemented from time to time with borrowings under our credit facilities with Wells Fargo Capital Finance LLC, or Wells Fargo. Significant fluctuations in our cash balances could harm our ability to meet our immediate liquidity needs, impair our capacity to react to sudden or unexpected contractions or growth in our business, reduce our ability to withstand a sustained period of economic crisis, and impair our ability to compete with competitors with greater financial resources. In addition, fluctuations in our cash balances could cause us to draw on our credit facilities and therefore reduce available funds under the facilities, and could cause us to violate the liquidity covenant under our credit agreement (see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in Item 7 of this Form 10-K). Furthermore, our credit agreement contains limitations on the amounts we may borrow at any time. Our Credit Agreement expires on October 1, 2015 and while we may choose to refinance our current credit facilities, we may not be successful in doing so on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or borrow sufficient funds under our current credit agreement or refinance our credit facilities, our liquidity may significantly decrease, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe have deferred a significant portion of revenues from customer transactions occurring prior to 2011 to subsequent periods. The deferred revenues resulted in our reporting net income for the fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014. However, as deferred revenues from periods prior to 2011 are amortized, there are no assurances that we will be able to report net income in future periods.\nAs a result of the restatement of our September 30, 2012 and prior financial statements, which was completed in 2014, we have deferred a significant portion of revenues from customer transactions occurring prior to 2011 to subsequent periods. The deferred revenue resulted in our reporting net income of approximately $15 million in 2014, $21 million in 2013, and $93 million in 2012 and also adversely affected our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital for those periods. As this deferred revenue is amortized, there are no assurances that we will be able to report net income in future periods. Our financial results and the impact of the deferred revenue are discussed in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 of this Form 10-K. We cannot be certain when, or if, our operations will be profitable in future periods.\nRestrictions in our credit agreement may limit our activities.\nOur current credit agreement for our revolving credit facilities contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit us, including limitations on our ability to make investments, incur additional indebtedness, issue equity and create liens. We are also required to meet a specified liquidity-based financial covenant under the terms of the credit agreement. Similar or additional restrictions and covenants may be included in any new credit facilities we may enter into on or prior to the expiration of our current facility on October 1, 2015. Failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under our current or future credit agreement, which could permit acceleration of any outstanding debt we may have in the future and require us to repay the debt before its scheduled due date. If an event of default were to occur, we might not have sufficient funds available to make the payments required. If we are unable to repay amounts owed, our lenders may be entitled to foreclose on and sell substantially all of our assets, which we have used to secure our borrowings under the credit agreement. In addition, our borrowings under the facility are secured by first priority liens on substantially all of our U.S. assets.\nOur revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate from period to period.\nOur results of operations have been and may continue to be subject to significant quarterly variation. Our results through 2016 will, in particular, be affected by the amortization of deferred revenues relating to periods prior to 2011. Our revenues and operating results for any particular quarter may also vary due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those enumerated under the section \u201cCautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K and:\n\u2022\nthe timing of large or enterprise-wide sales and our ability to recognize revenues from such sales;\n\u2022\ndemand planning and logistics;\n\u2022\nreliance on third-party reseller and distribution channels;\n\u2022\nchanges in operating expenses;\n\u2022\nprice protections and provisions for inventory obsolescence extended to resellers and distributors;\n\u2022\nseasonal factors, such as higher consumer demand at year-end; and\n\u2022\ncomplex accounting rules for revenue recognition.\nThe occurrence and interaction of these variables may cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate from period to period. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not provide a good indication of our future performance.\nOur revenue backlog estimates are based on certain assumptions and are subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and backlog orders may not be timely converted to revenues in any particular fiscal period, if at all, or be indicative of our actual operating results for any future period.\nOur revenue backlog, as we define it, consists of firm orders received and includes both (i) orders where the customer has paid in advance of our performance obligations being fulfilled, which are reflected as deferred revenues on our balance sheet, and (ii) orders for future product deliveries or services that have not yet been invoiced by us. To the extent that our customers cancel their orders with us or reduce their requirements during a particular period for any reason, we will not realize revenue or profit from the associated revenue backlog. Even where a project proceeds as scheduled, it is possible that the customer may default and fail to pay amounts owed to us. Material delays, payment defaults or cancellations could reduce the amount of revenue backlog currently reported, and consequently, could inhibit the conversion of that backlog into revenues. Furthermore, orders included in our revenue backlog may not be profitable. We may experience variances in the realization of our revenue backlog because of project delays or cancellations resulting from external market factors and economic factors beyond our control. As a result, even if we realize all of the revenue from the projects in our revenue backlog, if our expenses associated with these projects are higher than expected, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nFluctuations in foreign exchange rates may result in short-term currency exchange losses and could adversely affect our revenues from foreign markets and our manufacturing costs in the long term.\nOur international sales are, for the most part, transacted through foreign subsidiaries and generally in the currency of the end-user customers. Consequently, we are exposed to short-term currency exchange risks that may adversely affect our revenues, operating results and cash flows. The majority of our international sales are transacted in euros. To hedge against the dollar/euro exchange exposure of the resulting forecasted payables, receivables and cash balances, we may enter into foreign currency contracts. The success of our hedging programs depends on the accuracy of our forecasts of transaction activity in foreign currency. To the extent that these forecasts are over- or understated during periods of currency volatility, we may experience currency gains or losses. Our hedging activities may only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in dollar/euro exchange rates, which could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations.\nFurthermore, the significance to our business of sales in Europe subjects us to risks associated with long-term changes in the dollar/euro exchange rate. A sustained strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro would decrease our expected future U.S. dollar revenues from European sales and could have a significant adverse effect on our overall profit margins. During the past few years, economic instability in Europe, including concern over sovereign debt in Greece, Italy, Ireland and certain other European Union countries, caused significant fluctuations in the value of the euro relative to those of other currencies, including the U.S. dollar. Continuing uncertainty regarding economic conditions, including the solvency of these countries and the stability of the Eurozone, could lead to significant long-term economic weakness and reduced economic growth in Europe, the occurrence of which, or the potential occurrence of which, could lead to a sustained strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, adversely affecting the profitability of our European operations.\nIn addition, we source and manufacture many of our products in China and our costs may increase should the renminbi not remain stable with the U.S. dollar. Although the renminbi is pegged against a basket of currencies determined by the People\u2019s Bank of China, the renminbi may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in the long term. In addition, if China were to permit the renminbi to float to a free market rate of exchange, it is widely anticipated that the renminbi would appreciate significantly in value against U.S. dollar. An increase in the value of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar would have the effect of increasing the labor and production costs of our Chinese manufacturers in U.S. dollar terms, which may result in their passing such costs to us in the form of increased pricing, which would adversely affect our profit margins if we could not pass those price increases along to our customers.\nOur debt obligations may limit our ability to pursue investment opportunities and respond to business needs and economic and industry condition.\nIn October 2010, we entered into four-year secured revolving credit facilities in the aggregate principal amount of up to\n$60 million. On August 29, 2014, we extended the original maturity date of our revolving credit facilities from October 1, 2014 to October 1, 2015. The amount we are actually entitled to borrow at any time is limited by a formula in the agreement and may be less than $60 million. Any indebtedness we incur under current or future credit facilities could have negative consequences, including, increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing; limiting our ability to complete a merger or an acquisition; and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business.\nIf we are unable to satisfy our obligations under our credit agreement, our liquidity and ability to operate our business could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to satisfy our obligations under our current or future credit facilities will depend on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flows to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategy. If we are unable to meet our obligations under our current or future credit facilities, including our debt service obligations, or if we are unable to refinance our current credit facilities, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures or research and development expenditures, seek additional financing or equity capital, restructure or refinance our debt, or sell assets and our business could be adversely affected.\nEconomic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenues, gross margins and expenses.\nOur business is impacted by global economic conditions, which have been in recent years and continue to be volatile. Specifically, our revenues and gross margins depend significantly on global economic conditions and the demand for our products and services in the markets in which we compete. Economic weakness and uncertainty have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased revenue, gross margin, earnings or growth rates and difficulty managing inventory levels. Sustained uncertainty about global economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our products and services and could cause demand to differ materially from our expectations as customers curtail or delay spending on our products and services. Economic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to make accurate forecasts of revenues, gross margins and expenses.\nThe inability of our customers to obtain credit in the future may impair their ability to make timely payments to us. Tightening of credit by financial institutions could also lead customers to postpone spending or to cancel, decrease or delay their existing or future orders with us. Customer insolvencies could negatively impact our revenues and our ability to collect receivables. Financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. In the event we are impacted by global economic weakness, we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks related to our recent restatement, accounting review and internal controls\nOur internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2014. We may not be able to properly remediate existing or future weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal controls, which could adversely affect our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements, harm our reputation, negatively impact our stock price and damage our business.\nIn the second quarter of 2013, we determined that we needed to restate revenue for millions of customer transactions for interim and annual periods ended during the periods from January 1, 2005 to September 30, 2012 (the Restatement Periods) to correct errors in our historically issued financial statements. In addition, certain other adjustments arose in the Restatement Periods that were deemed material and were adjusted in the restated financial statements for the Restatement Periods. The errors in the misapplication of GAAP over revenue recognition and the other errors identified resulted from several control deficiencies that were in existence during the Restatement Periods. These control deficiencies individually and when aggregated represent material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and, as a result, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2014.\nAs described in Part II, Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, due to the limited time between (i) the completion of the restatement and related filing of the Annual Report on Form10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods in 2014 and (ii) management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, we have not had sufficient time to fully remediate the aforementioned deficiencies and/or there was insufficient passage of time to evidence that the controls that were implemented during 2014 were effective.\nWhile we continue with our efforts to remediate the identified weaknesses, we cannot assure you that our remediation efforts will be adequate to allow us to conclude that such controls will become effective during fiscal year 2015. We also cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not arise or be identified in the future. We intend to continue our control remediation activities and also to continue to improve our operational, information technology, financial systems, and infrastructure, procedures and controls, as well as to continue to expand, train, retain, and manage our personnel who are essential to effective internal control. In doing so, we will continue to incur expenses and expend management time on compliance-related issues.\nIf we fail to successfully remediate our material weaknesses and implement appropriate controls, we may not be able to prevent or detect a material misstatement in our financial statements on a timely basis or at all. Such misstatements could result in a future restatement of our financial statements, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, or could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in our stock price or litigation. Furthermore, our reputation could be harmed and our customers\u2019 and partners\u2019 confidence in us may be impaired, all of which could damage our business. For a discussion of the material weaknesses, please see Part II, Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures,\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nWe cannot assure you that our financial statement preparation and reporting processes are or will be adequate or that future restatements will not be required.\nWhile we have, following the restatement, significantly changed and enhanced our regular financial statement preparation and reporting processes (as described elsewhere in this report), as of the filing date of this report, previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting have not have been fully remediated and we continue to:\n\u2022\nmake changes to our finance organization;\n\u2022\nadopt new accounting and reporting processes and procedures;\n\u2022\nenhance our revenue recognition and other existing accounting policies and procedures;\n\u2022\nintroduce new or enhanced accounting systems and processes; and\n\u2022\nimprove our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe cannot assure you that the changes and enhancements made to date, or those that are still in process, are adequate, will operate as expected, or will be completed in a timely fashion (if still in process). As a result, we cannot assure you that we will not discover additional errors, that future financial reports will not contain material misstatements or omissions, that future restatements will not be required, that we will be able to timely complete our remaining SEC filings for periods subsequent to this report, or that we will be able to stay current with our reporting obligations in the future.\nWe have been named in class action lawsuits related to the circumstances that gave rise to our extended filing delay and recent restatement, and such delays and restatement continue to create the risk of further litigation against us, which could be expensive and could damage our business.\nWe and certain of our former executive officers have been named in class action lawsuits relating to our recent restatement. While we have reached an agreement in principle to settle the class action lawsuit, that settlement may not become final and the class action and any future litigation or action that may be filed against us, our current or former directors or officers may be time\nconsuming and expensive, and may distract management from the conduct of our business. Any such litigation or action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and may expose us to costly indemnification obligations to current or former officers, directors, or other personnel, regardless of the outcome of such matter.\nFollowing our disclosure of the accounting issues giving rise to our restatement we became subject to inquiries from the SEC and the Department of Justice. These government inquiries or any future inquiries to which we may become subject could result in penalties and/or other remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nFollowing our disclosure of the accounting matters giving rise to the restatement we became subject to inquiries from the SEC and the Department of Justice. We have fully cooperated, and intend to continue to fully cooperate, if called upon to do so, with the SEC and the DOJ regarding this matter. We have not received any inquiries from either agency in the past 12 months but have no assurance that one or both will not further pursue the matter.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of any of the foregoing unresolved proceedings or whether we will face additional government inquiries, investigations, or other actions related to these or other matters. An adverse ruling in any SEC enforcement action or other regulatory proceeding could impose upon us fines, penalties, or other remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Even if we are successful in defending against an SEC enforcement action or other regulatory proceeding, if any, such an action or proceeding may be time consuming, expensive, and distracting from the conduct of our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In the event of any such action or proceeding, we may also become subject to costly indemnification obligations to current or former officers, directors, or employees, who may not be covered by insurance.\nWe may not have sufficient insurance to cover our liability in any current or future litigation claims either due to coverage limits or as a result of insurance carriers seeking to deny coverage of such claims.\nWe face a variety of litigation-related liability risks, including liability for indemnification of (and advancement of expenses to) current and former directors, officers, and employees under certain circumstances, pursuant to our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, other applicable agreements, and/or Delaware law.\nOur directors and officers were included in a director and officer liability insurance policy, which covers all our directors and officers. Our insurance coverage under our policies may not be adequate to cover any indemnification or other claims against us. In addition, the underwriters of our present coverage may seek to avoid coverage in certain circumstances based upon the terms of the respective policies, in which case we would have to self-fund any indemnification amounts owed to our directors and officers and bear any other uninsured liabilities.\nIf we do not have sufficient directors and officers insurance coverage under our present or historical insurance policies, or if our insurance underwriters are successful in avoiding coverage, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThe previous delay in completing our financial statements, and any future failure to timely file required periodic reports with the SEC, may adversely affect our ability to raise, and the cost of raising, future capital.\nUntil we filed our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2014, which was filed on November 13, 2014, we were delinquent in our financial reporting obligations. Although we are current in our reporting obligations as of the date of filing of this annual report on Form 10-K, we will remain ineligible to use Form S-3 to register securities until we have timely filed all required periodic reports under the Exchange Act for at least twelve calendar months. During this time, we would need to use Form S-1 to register securities with the SEC (whether for capital raising transactions by us or to permit the resale of our securities by security holders), or issue such securities in private placements. Either of these alternatives entails greater costs, and may require more time to effect, than registering securities on Form S-3. As a result, our ability to raise capital, and the cost of raising future capital, could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.\nAs a result of the delay in filing our periodic reports with the SEC, our common stock was suspended from trading on NASDAQ effective February 25, 2014 and formally de-listed effective May 2, 2014. Our common stock was relisted for trading on NASDAQ on December 8, 2014. Prior to and during the suspension of trading from NASDAQ as well as following our relisting on NASDAQ, the market price of our common stock has experienced volatility. Our stock may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nperiod-to-period variations in our revenues or operating results;\n\u2022\nour failure to accurately forecast revenues or operating results;\n\u2022\nour ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements;\n\u2022\nwhether our results meet analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u2022\nmarket reaction to significant corporate initiatives or announcements;\n\u2022\nour ability to innovate;\n\u2022\nour relative competitive position within our markets;\n\u2022\nshifts in markets or demand for our solutions;\n\u2022\nchanges in our relationships with suppliers, resellers, distributors or customers;\n\u2022\nour commencement of, or involvement in, litigation;\n\u2022\nshort sales, hedging or other derivative transactions involving shares of our common stock; and\n\u2022\nshifts in financial markets.\nAdditionally, broader financial market and global economic trends may affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and stockholder rights plan may have the effect of discouraging advantageous offers for our business or common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation, bylaws, and the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law include provisions that may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change of control. In addition, we have a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change of control. These provisions could limit the price that our stockholders might receive in the future for shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 78955, "SIC": 3861, "TIC": "AVID"}
