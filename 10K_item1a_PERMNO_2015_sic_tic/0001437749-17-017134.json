Risk Factors.\nThe following risk factors, as well as other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, should be considered by investors in connection with any investment in the Company\u2019s common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Significant Customers\nWe are significantly dependent on our contractual relationship with FedEx Corporation, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nIn the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, 47% of our consolidated operating revenues, and 100% of the operating revenues for our overnight air cargo segment, arose from services we provided to FedEx. Our current agreements may be terminated by FedEx upon 90 days\u2019 written notice and FedEx may at any time terminate the lease of any particular aircraft thereunder upon 10 days\u2019 written notice. In addition, FedEx may terminate the dry-lease agreement with MAC or CSA upon written notice if 60% or more of MAC or CSA\u2019s revenue (excluding revenues arising from reimbursement payments under the dry-lease agreement) is derived from the services performed by it pursuant to the respective dry-lease agreement, FedEx becomes its only customer, or it employs less than six employees. As of the date of this report, FedEx would have been permitted to terminate each of the new dry-lease agreements under this provision. FedEx has been a customer of the Company since 1980. The loss of these contracts with FedEx would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nChanges in our agreements with FedEx subject us to greater operating risks.\nOn June 1, 2015, MAC and CSA entered into new dry-lease agreements with FedEx with terms different from our prior dry-lease service contracts. The dry-lease agreements provide for the lease of specified aircraft by us in return for the payment of monthly rent with respect to each aircraft leased, which monthly rent was increased from the prior dry-lease service contracts to reflect an estimate of a fair market rental rate. The dry-lease agreements provide for the reimbursement by FedEx of our costs, without mark up, incurred in connection with the operation of the leased aircraft for the following: fuel, landing fees, third-party maintenance, parts and certain other direct operating costs. Unlike the prior dry-lease contracts, under the new dry-lease agreements, certain operational costs incurred by us in operating the aircraft are not reimbursed by FedEx at cost, and such operational costs are to be borne solely by us. The current dry-lease agreements provide for the payment by FedEx to us of a monthly administrative fee based on the number and type of aircraft leased and routes operated. The amount of the monthly administrative fee under the current dry-lease agreements is greater than under the prior dry-lease service contracts with FedEx, in part to reflect the greater monthly lease payment per aircraft and that certain operational costs are to be borne by MAC and CSA and not reimbursed. Accordingly, as a result in the change in our arrangements with FedEx as reflected in the new dry-lease agreements, we are subject to the risk of rising operational costs that are no longer reimbursed to us at cost and may be in excess of the allocable portion of the increased administrative fee, which could adversely affect results of operations. In addition, since MAC and CSA entered into the new dry-lease agreements in 2015, they have periodically entered into amendments to the agreements with FedEx that have adjusted the administrative fees payable under these agreements. These adjustments, which have generally been made on an annual basis, have resulted in annual period-to-period volatility in MAC and CSA\u2019s profitability. Although MAC and CSA have entered into such an amendment effective as of June 1, 2017 which is expected to positively affect MAC and CSA\u2019s profitability compared to results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, future amendments may reduce the administrative fees and accordingly negatively affect MAC and CSA\u2019s profitability.\nBecause of our dependence on FedEx, we are subject to the risks that may affect FedEx\u2019s operations.\nBecause of our dependence on FedEx, we are subject to the risks that may affect FedEx\u2019s operations. These risks are discussed in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition-Risk Factors\u201d in FedEx Corporation\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017. These risks include but are not limited to the following:\n\u25cf\nEconomic conditions in the global markets in which it operates;\n\u25cf\nDependence on its strong reputation and value of its brand;\n\u25cf\nPotential disruption to the Internet and FedEx\u2019s technology infrastructure, including customer websites, including cyberattacks;\n\u25cf\nThe price and availability of fuel;\n\u25cf\nIts ability to manage its assets, including aircraft, to match shifting and future shipping volumes;\n\u25cf\nIntense competition from other providers of transportation and business services;\n\u25cf\nChanges in governmental regulations that may affect its business;\n\u25cf\nIts ability to make prudent strategic acquisitions and realize the expected benefits;\n\u25cf\nIts ability to maintain good relationships with its employees and prevent attempts by labor organizations to organize groups of its employees;\n\u25cf\nThe continued classification of owner-operators in its ground delivery business as independent contractors rather than as employees;\n\u25cf\nThe impact of the United Kingdom\u2019s planned withdrawal from the European Union;\n\u25cf\nThe impact of terrorist activities including the imposition of stricter governmental security requirements;\n\u25cf\nRegulatory actions affecting global aviation rights or a failure to obtain or maintain aviation rights in important international markets;\n\u25cf\nGlobal climate change or legal, regulatory or market responses to such change;\n\u25cf\nLocalized natural or man-made disasters in key locations, including its Memphis, Tennessee super-hub;\n\u25cf\nDisruptions or modifications in service by the United States Postal Service, a significant customer and vendor of FedEx; and\n\u25cf\nWidespread outbreak of an illness or other communicable disease or any other public health crisis.\nA material reduction in the aircraft we fly for FedEx could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nUnder our agreements with FedEx, we are not guaranteed a number of aircraft or routes we are to fly and FedEx may reduce the number of aircraft we lease and operate upon 10 days\u2019 written notice. Our compensation under these agreements, including our administrative fees, depends on the number of aircraft leased to us by FedEx. Any material permanent reduction in the aircraft we operate could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. A temporary reduction in any period could materially adversely affect our results of operations for that period.\nOur ground support services segment has been dependent upon the revenues from two significant customers, the loss of which could materially impact the segment\u2019s results.\nIn the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, approximately 42% of GAS\u2019s revenues were derived from services under contracts with two customers. The loss of these customers, or a major decline in business activity with these customers, could materially adversely impact the results of the segment.\nOther Business Risks\nOur revenues for aircraft maintenance services fluctuate based on the heavy maintenance check schedule, which is based on aircraft usage, for aircraft flown by our overnight air cargo operations.\nThe maintenance revenues of our overnight air cargo segment are affected based on the level of heavy maintenance checks performed on aircraft operated by our overnight air cargo operations which is affected by the level of usage of the aircraft. Accordingly, the maintenance revenues of our overnight air cargo segment fluctuate from period to period. In addition, if the number of aircraft operated for FedEx were to decrease, we would likely experience fewer maintenance hours and consequently, less maintenance revenue.\nIncidents or accidents involving products and services that we sell may result in liability or otherwise adversely affect our operating results for a period.\nIncidents or accidents may occur involving the products and services that we sell. While we maintain products liability and other insurance in amounts we believe are customary and appropriate, and may have rights to pursue subcontractors in the event that we have any liability in connection with accidents involving products that we sell, it is possible that in the event of multiple accidents the amount of our insurance coverage would not be adequate.\nThe suspension or revocation of FAA certifications could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur overnight air cargo operations are subject to regulations of the FAA. The FAA can suspend or revoke the authority of air carriers or their licensed personnel for failure to comply with its regulations and can ground aircraft if questions arise concerning airworthiness. The FAA also has power to suspend or revoke for cause the certificates it issues and to institute proceedings for imposition and collection of fines for violation of federal aviation regulations. Our overnight air cargo subsidiaries, MAC and CSA, operate under separate FAA certifications. Although it is possible that, in the event that the certification of one of our subsidiaries was suspended or revoked, flights operated by that subsidiary could be transferred to the other subsidiary, we can offer no assurance that we would be able to transfer flight operations in that manner. Accordingly, the suspension or revocation of any one of these certifications could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nSales of deicing equipment can be affected by weather conditions.\nOur deicing equipment is used to deice commercial and military aircraft. The extent of deicing activity depends on the severity of winter weather. Mild winter weather conditions permit airports to use fewer deicing units, since less time is required to deice aircraft in mild weather conditions. As a result, airports may be able to extend the useful lives of their existing units, reducing the demand for new units.\nOur results of operations may be affected by the value of securities we hold for investment and we may be unable to liquidate our investments in a timely manner at full value.\nWe invest a significant portion of our capital not needed for operations in marketable securities, including equity securities of publicly traded companies. At March 31, 2017, the fair value of these marketable securities was approximately $4.6 million, of which $2.5 million represents the fair value of shares of common stock of Insignia Systems, Inc. Our results of operations may be affected by gains or losses recognized upon the sale of these investments or by losses recognized upon the determination that any such investment has become impaired or suffered an \u201cother-than-temporary\u201d impairment. At March 31, 2017, we had gross unrealized gains associated with marketable securities aggregating $279,000 and gross unrealized losses aggregating $2,771,000.\nAny investment with a fair value of less than its cost basis is assessed for possible \u201cother-than-temporary\u201d impairment regularly and at each reporting date. Other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale marketable equity securities are recognized in the consolidated statement of income (loss). On the basis of its June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2017 assessments, the Company concluded that it had suffered an \u201cother-than-temporary\u201d impairment in its investment in the common stock of Insignia Systems, Inc. (\u201cInsignia\u201d). In reaching this conclusion, management gave significant weight to the fact that, as of June 30, 2016 and as of March 31, 2017, the Company\u2019s investment in Insignia had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for well over one year and that the magnitude of the unrealized loss had increased sharply during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 and the quarter ended March 31, 2017. While management believed that it was reasonably possible that the unrealized loss at March 31, 2017 would reverse prior to the Company\u2019s divestment of the security, management concluded that the weight of the evidence warranted the \u201cother-than-temporary\u201d impairment. Consistent with the applicable accounting guidance, the Company\u2019s cost basis in the Insignia investment was lowered to $3,604,000 at June 30, 2016 and to $2,643,000 at March 31, 2017 to reflect the impairment charge.\nOn the basis of its March 31, 2017 assessment, the Company concluded that it had suffered an additional \u201cother-than-temporary\u201d impairment in its investment in marketable securities for approximately $112,000.\nIn addition, from time to time we may hold positions in marketable securities that under then-current market conditions we may be unable to liquidate in a timely manner at full value. For example, at May 31, 2017, we held approximately 1.65 million shares of common stock of Insignia Systems, Inc., representing approximately 14% of the outstanding shares and approximately 110 times the average daily trading volume for such shares for the preceding 50 days. In the event that we are unable to liquidate an investment at full value our gain from the sale of that investment may be reduced or our loss from the sale of that investment may be increased.\nOur business may be adversely affected by information technology disruptions.\nOur business may be impacted by information technology disruptions, including information technology attacks. Cybersecurity attacks, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data (our own or that of third parties). Although we have adopted certain measures to mitigate potential risks to our systems from information technology-related disruptions, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, misappropriation, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by numerous other risks, including rising healthcare costs, changes in environmental laws and other unforeseen business interruptions.\nOur business may be negatively impacted by numerous other risks. For example, medical and healthcare costs may continue to increase. Initiatives to address these costs, such as consumer driven health plan packages, may not successfully reduce these expenses as needed. Failure to offer competitive employee benefits may result in our inability to recruit or maintain key employees. Additional risks to our business include global or local events which could significantly disrupt our operations. Terrorist attacks, natural disasters and electrical grid disruptions and outages are some of the unforeseen risks that could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have identified material weaknesses related to our internal controls and there can be no assurance that material weaknesses will not be identified in the future.\nAs described elsewhere in Part II, Item 9A of this report, we have identified a number of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which existed at March 31, 2017. In addition, we have previously identified material weaknesses with respect to our accounting for our investments in Delphax. As a result of an error in the accounting for the attribution of the net income or loss of Delphax to non-controlling interests, we restated our consolidated financial statements at and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, and the selected quarterly financial data for the final two quarters in the fiscal year then ended, as well as our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2015, the three months ended June 30, 2016, the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016 and selected consolidated balance sheet data at December 31, 2015, March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016, September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nVarious provisions and laws could delay or prevent a change of control.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of Delaware corporation law could delay or prevent a change of control or may impede the ability of the holders of our common stock to change our management. In particular, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, among other things regulate how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholders\u2019 meetings and authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series, without shareholder approval.", "PERMNO": 11368, "SIC": 4513, "TIC": "AIRT"}
