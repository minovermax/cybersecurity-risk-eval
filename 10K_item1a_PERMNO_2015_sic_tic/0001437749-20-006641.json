{"cik": "14707", "company": "CALERES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A\nRISK FACTORS\nThe recent cororavirus outbreak had adversely affected and continues to impact our business operations, store traffic and financial condition.\nThe outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) both in the U.S. and globally, and related government and private sector responsive actions, has adversely affected and continues to impact our business operations. It is impossible to predict the effect and ultimate impact of COVID-19 and the impact on the economy, the retail industry and the Company. The spread of COVID-19 has caused public health officials to recommend precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, which has impacted retail store traffic and consumer sentiment. Effective March 19, 2020, we announced the temporary closure of all retail stores throughout the United States and Canada. While the store closures are expected to be temporary, we cannot reasonably estimate the duration of the store closures, the impact on consumer demand and the impact to our wholesale customers that may also have been impacted by store closures, nor the impact to our 2020 financial results or cash flows. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact. A prolonged health crisis may have a material impact on the retail sector, consumer demand, and the Company's results of operations and liquidity.\nConsumer demand for our products may be adversely impacted by economic conditions and other factors.\nWorldwide economic conditions continue to be uncertain. Consumer confidence and spending are strongly influenced by general economic conditions and other factors, including COVID-19, fiscal policy, the changing tax and regulatory environment, interest rates, minimum wage rates and regulations, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, the liquidity of consumers\u2019 assets, health care costs, currency exchange rates, taxation, energy costs, real estate values, foreclosure rates, unemployment trends, weather conditions and the economic consequences of military action or terrorist activities. Negative economic conditions generally decrease disposable income and, consequently, consumer purchases of discretionary items like our products. Negative trends in economic conditions could also drive up the cost of our products, which may require us to increase our product prices. These increases in our product costs, and possibly prices, may not be offset by comparable increases in consumer disposable income. As a result, our customers may choose to purchase fewer of our products or purchase the lower priced products of our competitors, and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. The COVID-19 outbreak and resulting global economic decline is expected to have an adverse impact on consumer demand for our products during 2020 and the long-term impact cannot be reasonably predicted.\nA long-term decline in our stock price may result in impairment charges.\nAs a result of COVID-19 and the resulting impact to the economy, global stock prices have dropped considerably, including the Company's stock price. If there is an extended period of lower stock market valuations or an extended closure timeframe for our retail stores and for those of our wholesale customers, the Company may be required to perform additional impairment tests for its goodwill and intangible assets and long-lived assets, which may result in material impairment charges during 2020.\nIf we are unable to anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends and successfully apply new technology, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net sales and earnings.\nThe footwear industry is subject to rapidly changing consumer shopping preferences and patterns and fashion trends. Our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change. In addition, the continuing consumer shift to online and mobile shopping is requiring retailers to lower shipping costs, improve shipping speeds and optimize mobile platforms. The trend toward online and mobile shopping increases the volume of smaller shipments, including single-pair shipments, from our warehouses. The increased volume of smaller shipments may result in higher average distribution costs, including both shipping and processing costs incurred at our distribution centers. The success of both our wholesale and retail operations depends largely on our ability to anticipate, understand and react to these changing consumer shopping patterns. If we fail to respond to changes in consumer shopping patterns, demands and fashion trends, develop new products and designs, and implement effective, responsive merchandising and distribution strategies and programs, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories and lower gross margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nCompetition is intense in the footwear industry. There has also been consolidation of competitors in the industry, resulting in certain competitors that are larger and have greater financial, marketing and technological resources than we do. In addition, a move toward vertical integration by our competitors could create additional competitive pressures that may decrease our market share. Other competitors are able to offer footwear on a lateral basis alongside their apparel products, or have successfully branded their trademarks as lifestyle brands, resulting in greater competitive advantages. Low barriers to entry into this industry further intensify competition by allowing new companies to easily enter the markets in which we compete. Some of our suppliers further compound these competitive pressures by allowing consumers to purchase their products directly through supplier-maintained Internet sites and retail stores. The Internet facilitates price transparency and comparison shopping, which increases the level of competition we face and puts competitive pressure on us to keep our prices low.\nWe believe that our ability to compete successfully in the footwear industry depends on a number of factors, including style, price, performance, quality, location and service, as well as the strength of our brand names. We remain competitive by increasing awareness of our brands, improving the efficiency of our supply chain and enhancing the style, comfort, fashion and perceived value of our products. However, our competitors may implement more effective marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, make more attractive offers to potential employees, distribution partners and manufacturers, or respond more quickly to changes in consumer preferences than us. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully in the future, and increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins, loss of market share and an inability to generate cash flows that are sufficient to maintain or expand the development and marketing of our products, which could adversely impact our financial results.\nWe rely primarily on foreign sources of production, which subjects our business to risks associated with international trade.\nWe rely primarily on foreign sourcing for our footwear products through third-party manufacturing facilities located outside the United States. As is common in the industry, we do not have any long-term contracts with our third-party foreign manufacturers. Foreign sourcing is subject to numerous risks, including trade relations, work stoppages, transportation delays (including delays at foreign and domestic ports) and costs (including customs duties, quotas, tariffs, anti-dumping duties, safeguard measures, cargo restrictions or other trade restrictions), domestic and foreign political instability, foreign currency fluctuations, variable economic conditions, expropriation, nationalization, natural disasters, terrorist acts and military conflict, changes in governmental regulations (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) and geo-political events (including the potential impact of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, or \"Brexit\" that occurred on January 31, 2020). In addition, China and other countries are experiencing a public health emergency due to COVID-19. While we have experienced some disruption to our supply chain, we cannot accurately predict the full impact that the coronavirus epidemic will have on the ability of manufacturers either in China or in other countries to produce our products. However, the majority of our factory partners are now operational. There is also uncertainty surrounding U.S. presidential and congressional elections in 2020 and the impact of any changes to trade legislation. At the same time, potential changes in manufacturing preferences, including, but not limited to the following, pose additional risk and uncertainty:\n\u2022\nManufacturing capacity may shift from footwear to other industries with manufacturing margins that are perceived to be higher.\n\u2022\nSome footwear manufacturers may face labor shortages as workers seek better wages and working conditions in other industries and locations.\nAs a result of these risks, there can be no assurance that we will not experience reductions in available production capacity, increases in our product costs, late deliveries or terminations of our supplier relationships. Furthermore, these sourcing risks are compounded by the lack of diversification in the geographic location of our foreign sourcing and manufacturing. With the majority of our supply originating in China, a substantial portion of our supply could be at risk in the event of any significant negative development related to relations between United States and China.\nAlthough we believe we could find alternative manufacturing sources for the products that we currently source from third-party manufacturing facilities in China or other countries, we may not be able to locate alternative manufacturers on terms as favorable as our current terms, including pricing, payment terms, manufacturing capacity, quality standards and lead times for delivery. In addition, there is substantial competition in the footwear industry for quality footwear manufacturers. Accordingly, our future results will partly depend on our ability to maintain positive working relationships with, and offer competitive terms to, our foreign manufacturers. If supply issues cause us to be unable to provide products consistent with our standards or manufacture our footwear in an efficient and cost-effective manner, our customers may cancel orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand reductions in purchase prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe imposition of tariffs on our products may result in higher costs and decreased gross profits.\nRecent international events have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to trade wars and tariffs, which may affect trade between the United States and other countries, particularly with China. We rely primarily on foreign sourcing for our footwear through third-party manufacturing facilities located outside the United States, with the majority of our footwear sourced from manufacturing facilities in China that is subject to a 15% tariff that became effective as of September 1, 2019. Certain types of footwear were subject to a tariff that was to go into effect on December 15, 2019 but was later reversed. While we continue to focus on mitigating the impact of the enacted tariffs, if we are unable to mitigate the impact or if there is a prolonged trade war involving the further escalation of tariffs, our product costs may increase on a significant portion of our branded footwear that we source internationally. Higher product costs may in turn result in lower gross margins in the future for products that we source from China.\nOur operating results depend on preparing accurate sales forecasts and properly managing our inventory levels.\nUsing sales forecasts, we place orders with manufacturers for some of our products prior to the time we receive all of our customers\u2019 orders to minimize purchasing costs, the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non-delivery. We also maintain an inventory of certain products that we anticipate will be in greater demand. At the retail level, we place orders for products many months in advance of our key selling seasons. Adverse economic conditions and rapidly changing consumer preferences can make it difficult for us and our retail customers to accurately forecast product trends in order to match production with demand. If we fail to accurately assess consumer fashion tastes and the impact of economic factors on consumer spending or to effectively differentiate our retail and wholesale offerings, our inventory levels may exceed customer demand, resulting in inventory write-downs, higher carrying costs, lower gross margins or the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could significantly impact our financial results. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply the quality products that we require in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages may delay shipments to customers (and possibly require us to offer discounts or costly expedited shipping), negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships, adversely impact our sales results and diminish brand awareness and loyalty. The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in lower sales, and lower sales projections, particularly in the first half of 2020. The full impact of the pandemic and its impact on consumer sentiment is difficult to estimate. In addition, the impact of the pandemic on our third-party independent manufacturers in China or other countries did cause temporary disruptions in our supply chain; however, the majority of our factory partners are now operational.\nWe are reliant upon our information technology systems, and any major disruption of these systems could adversely impact our ability to effectively operate our business.\nOur computer network and systems are essential to all aspects of our operations, including design, pricing, production, accounting, reporting, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution. Our ability to manage and maintain our inventory and to deliver products in a timely manner depends on these systems. If any of these systems fails to operate as expected, we experience problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, a breach in security occurs or a natural disaster interrupts system functions, we may experience delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency in our operations or be required to expend significant capital to correct the problem, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nA cybersecurity breach may adversely affect our sales and reputation.\nWe routinely possess sensitive consumer and associate information and periodically provide it to third parties for analysis, benefit distribution or compliance purposes. While we believe we have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect that information, hackers and data thieves operate sophisticated, large-scale attacks that could breach our information systems, despite ongoing security measures. In addition, we are required to comply with increasingly complex regulations designed to protect our business and personal data. Any breach of our network security, a third-party\u2019s network security or failure to comply with applicable regulations may result in (a) the loss of valuable business data and/or our consumers\u2019 or associates\u2019 personal information, (b) increased costs associated with implementing additional protections and processes, (c) a disruption of our business and a loss of sales, (d) negative media attention, (e) damage to our consumer and associate relationships and reputation, and (f) fines or lawsuits.\nCustomer concentration and other trends in customer behavior may lead to a reduction in or loss of sales.\nOur wholesale customers include national chains, online retailers, department stores, mass merchandisers, independent retailers and catalogs. Several of our customers operate multiple department store divisions. Furthermore, we often sell multiple types of branded, licensed and private-label footwear to these same customers. While we believe purchasing decisions in many cases are made independently by the buyers and merchandisers of each of the customers, a decision by a significant customer to decrease the amount of footwear products purchased from us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation, including store count reductions at major retail chains, and consumers' continued shift to online shopping, we and our wholesale customers increasingly depend upon a reduced number of key retailers whose bargaining strength is growing. This consolidation may result in the following adverse consequences:\n\u2022\nOur wholesale customers may seek more favorable terms for their purchases of our products, which could limit our ability to raise prices, recoup cost increases or achieve our profit goals.\n\u2022\nThe number of stores that carry our products could decline, thereby exposing us to a greater concentration of accounts receivable risk and negatively impacting our brand visibility.\nWe also face the following risks with respect to our customers:\n\u2022\nOur customers could develop in-house brands or use a higher mix of private-label footwear products, which would negatively impact our sales.\n\u2022\nAs we sell our products to customers and extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer\u2019s financial condition, the financial difficulties of a customer could cause us to stop doing business with that customer, reduce our business with that customer or be unable to collect from that customer.\n\u2022\nSince we transact primarily in United States dollars, our international customers could purchase from competitors who will transact business in their local currency.\n\u2022\nCertain of our major wholesale customers have experienced a significant downturn or disruption in their business, including the impact of COVID-19. Many of our wholesale customers are having temporary store closures and have sought to cancel orders. If our customers continue to experience significant downturns or disruptions in their business, we expect these customers will reduce their purchases of our products.\n\u2022\nRetailers are directly sourcing more of their products directly from foreign manufacturers and reducing their reliance on wholesalers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nTransitional challenges with acquisitions could result in unexpected expenditures of time and resources.\nPeriodically, we pursue acquisitions of other companies or businesses, such as our 2018 acquisitions of Blowfish Malibu and Vionic, as further discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Although we review the records of acquisition candidates, the review may not reveal all existing or potential problems. As a result, we may not accurately assess the value of the business and may, accordingly, ultimately assume unknown adverse operating conditions and/or unanticipated expenses and liabilities related to the acquisition. Acquisitions may also cause us to incur debt, write-offs of goodwill or intangible assets if the business does not perform as well as expected and substantial amortization expenses associated with other intangible assets. We face the risk that the returns on acquisitions will not support the expenditures or indebtedness incurred to acquire or launch such businesses. We also face the risk that we will not be able to integrate acquisitions into our existing operations effectively without substantial expense, delay or other operational or financial problems. Integration may be hindered by, among other things, differing procedures, including internal controls, business practices and technology systems. We may need to allocate more management resources to integration than we planned, which may adversely affect our ability to pursue other profitable activities.\nA disruption in the effective functioning of our distribution centers could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory on a timely basis.\nWe currently use several distribution centers, which are leased or third-party managed. These distribution centers serve as the source of replenishment of inventory for our footwear stores and e-commerce websites operated by our Famous Footwear and Brand Portfolio segments and serve the wholesale operations of our Brand Portfolio segment. Our success depends on our ability to handle the rapid consumer shift to online shopping and single pair shipments, which requires significant capital to operate with a greater level of sophistication and automation, as well as higher processing and distribution costs. We may be unable to successfully manage, negotiate or renew our third-party distribution center agreements, or we may experience complications with respect to our distribution centers, such as substantial damage to, or destruction of, such facilities due to natural disasters or ineffective information technology systems. In such an event, our other distribution centers may not be able to support the resulting additional distribution demands and we may be unable to locate alternative persons or entities capable of fulfilling our distribution needs, resulting in an adverse effect on our ability to deliver inventory on a timely basis. The COVID-19 outbreak may also adversely impact the effective operation of our distribution centers as a result of temporary retail store closures, labor shortages as a result of government mandates to stop the spread of the virus, or disruptions to the supply chain. Some of our distribution centers are located in California, which is a state that has been more severely impacted by COVID-19.\nForeign currency fluctuations may result in higher costs and decreased gross profits.\nAlthough we purchase most of our products from foreign manufacturers in United States dollars and otherwise engage in foreign currency hedging transactions, we cannot ensure that we will not experience cost variations with respect to exchange rate changes. Currency exchange rate fluctuations may also adversely impact third parties who manufacture the Company\u2019s products by making their purchases of raw materials or other production costs more expensive and more difficult to finance, resulting in higher prices and lower margins for the Company, its distributors and licensees.\nChanges in tax laws may result in increased volatility in our effective tax rates.\nOur financial results are significantly impacted by the effective tax rates of both our domestic and international operations. Our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by certain provisions of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Act\"), which was enacted in December 2017, that directly affect foreign earnings, such as the global intangible low-taxed income tax (\"GILTI\") and base-erosion and anti-abuse tax provisions (\"BEAT\"). Other factors, such as changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in permitted deductions, changes in tax laws, interpretations, policies and treaties and the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions, may result in higher taxes, lower profitability and increased volatility in our financial results.\nOur success depends on our ability to retain senior management and recruit and retain other key associates.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified management, administrative, product development and sales personnel to support existing operations and future growth. In addition, our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses often depends on our ability to retain incumbent personnel, many of whom possess valuable institutional knowledge and operating experience. Competition for qualified personnel in the footwear industry is intense and we compete for these individuals with other companies that in many cases have superior financial and other resources. The loss of the services of any member of our senior management or key associates, the inability to attract and retain other qualified personnel or the inability to effectively transition positions could adversely affect the sales, design and production of our products as well as the implementation of our strategic initiatives.\nOur business, sales and brand value could be harmed by violations of labor, trade or other laws.\nWe focus on doing business with those suppliers who share our commitment to responsible business practices and the principles set forth in our Production Code of Conduct (the \u201cPCOC\u201d). By requiring our suppliers to comply with the PCOC, we encourage our suppliers to promote best practices and work toward continual improvement throughout their production operations. The PCOC sets forth standards for working conditions and other matters, including compliance with applicable labor practices, workplace environment and compliance with laws. Although we promote ethical business practices, we do not control our suppliers or their labor practices. A failure by any of our suppliers to adhere to these standards or laws could cause us to incur additional costs for our products or cause negative publicity and harm our business and reputation. We also require our suppliers to meet our standards for product safety, including compliance with applicable laws and standards with respect to safety issues, including lead content in paint. Failure by any of our suppliers to adhere to product safety standards could lead to a product recall, which may result in critical media coverage, harm our business and reputation, and cause us to incur additional costs.\nIn addition, if we, or our suppliers or foreign manufacturers, violate United States or foreign trade laws or regulations, we may be subject to additional duties, significant monetary penalties, the seizure and forfeiture of the products we are attempting to import or the loss of our import privileges. Possible violations of United States or foreign laws or regulations could include inadequate record keeping of our imported products, misstatements or errors as to the origin, classification, marketing or valuation of our imported products, fraudulent visas or labor violations. The effects of these factors could render our conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical and have a negative impact on our operating results.\nIf we are unable to maintain working relationships with our major branded suppliers, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely impacted.\nOur Famous Footwear segment purchases a substantial portion of its footwear products from major branded suppliers. Purchases from one major branded supplier, Nike, Inc., comprises approximately 23% of sales for the Famous Footwear segment. As is common in the industry, we do not have any long-term contracts with our suppliers. In addition, the success of our financial performance is dependent on the ability of our Famous Footwear segment to obtain products from our suppliers on a timely basis and on acceptable terms. While we believe our relationships with our current suppliers are good, the loss of any of our major suppliers or product developed exclusively for our Famous Footwear stores could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, negative trends in global economic conditions may adversely impact our suppliers. If these third parties do not perform their obligations or are unable to provide us with the materials and services we need at prices and terms that are acceptable to us, our ability to meet our consumers\u2019 demand could be adversely affected.\nOur reputation and competitive position are dependent on our ability to license well-recognized brands, license our own brands under successful licensing arrangements and protect our intellectual property rights.\nLicenses - Company as Licensee\nAlthough we own most of our wholesale brands, we also rely on our ability to attract, retain and maintain good relationships with licensors that have strong, well-recognized brands and trademarks. Our license agreements are generally for an initial term of two to four years, subject to renewal, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these licenses. Even our longer-term or renewable licenses are typically dependent upon our ability to market and sell the licensed products at specified levels, and the failure to meet such levels may result in the termination or non-renewal of such licenses. Furthermore, many of our license agreements require minimum royalty payments, and if we are unable to generate sufficient sales and profitability to cover these minimum royalty requirements, we may be required to make additional payments to the licensors that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, because certain of our license agreements are non-exclusive, new or existing competitors may obtain licenses with overlapping product or geographic terms, resulting in increased competition for a particular market.\nLicenses - Company as Licensor\nWe have entered into numerous license agreements with respect to the brands and trademarks that we own. While we have significant control over our licensees\u2019 products and advertising, we generally cannot control their operational and financial issues. If our licensees are not able to meet annual sales and royalty goals, obtain financing, manage their supply chain, control quality and maintain positive relationships with their customers, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected. While we would likely have the ability to terminate an underperforming license, it may be difficult and costly to locate an acceptable substitute distributor or licensee, and we may experience a disruption in our sales and brand visibility. In addition, although many of our license agreements prohibit the licensees from entering into licensing arrangements with certain of our competitors, they are generally not prohibited from offering, under other brands, the types of products covered by their license agreements with us.\nTrademarks\nWe believe that our trademarks and trade names are important to our success and competitive position because our distinctive marks create a market for our products and distinguish our products from other products. We cannot, however, guarantee that we will be able to secure protection for our intellectual property in the future or that such protection will be adequate for future operations. Furthermore, we face the risk of ineffective protection of intellectual property rights in jurisdictions where we source and distribute our products, some of which do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States. If we are unsuccessful in challenging a party\u2019s products on the basis of infringement of our intellectual property rights, continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales, devalue our brands and result in a shift in consumer preference away from our products. We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights, and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur retail business depends on our ability to secure affordable and desirable leased locations without creating a competitive concentration of stores.\nThe success of the retail business within our Famous Footwear and Brand Portfolio segments depends, in part, on our ability to secure affordable, long-term leases in desirable locations for our leased retail footwear stores and to secure renewals of such leases. As consumer shopping preferences have evolved, we continue to focus on opening stores in locations with a greater penetration of high-value consumers. No assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully negotiate lease renewals for existing stores or obtain acceptable terms for new stores in desirable locations. In addition, opening new stores in our existing markets may result in reduced net sales in existing stores as our stores become more concentrated in the markets we serve. As a result, the number of consumers and financial performance of individual stores may decline and the average sales per square foot at our stores may be reduced. This may result in impairments that adversely impact our financial results.\nOur quarterly sales and earnings may fluctuate, which may result in volatility in, or a decline in, our stock price.\nOur quarterly sales and earnings can vary due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022 The recent COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the global economy. Sales and earnings in the first quarter of 2020 have been adversely impacted by the pandemic, and may continue to be impacted during 2020.\n\u2022\nOur Famous Footwear retail business is seasonally weighted to the back-to-school season, which primarily falls in our third fiscal quarter. As a result, the success of our back-to-school offering, which is affected by our ability to anticipate consumer demand and fashion trends, could have a disproportionate impact on our full year results.\n\u2022\nIn our wholesale business, sales of footwear are dependent on orders from our major customers, and they may change delivery schedules, change the mix of products they order or cancel orders without penalty.\n\u2022\nOur wholesale customers have been moving toward lower initial orders and more replenishment orders, which may result in shifts of sales between quarters.\n\u2022\nOur estimated annual tax rate is based on projections of our domestic and international operating results for the year, which we review and revise as necessary each quarter.\n\u2022\nOur earnings are also sensitive to a number of factors that are beyond our control, including manufacturing and transportation costs, changes in product sales mix, geographic sales trends, weather conditions, consumer sentiment and currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nAs a result of these specific and other general factors, our operating results will vary from quarter to quarter and the results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the full year. Any shortfall in sales or earnings from the levels expected by investors could cause a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings, which could result in the unexpected expenditure of time and resources.\nWe are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions (including environmental matters) relating to our business and to our past operations. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings are expensive and will require that we devote substantial resources and executive time to defend, thereby diverting management\u2019s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for further discussion of pending matters.\nA significant portion of our Famous Footwear sales are dependent on our Famous Footwear loyalty program, Famously You Rewards (\"Rewards\"), and any decrease in sales from Rewards could have a material adverse impact on our sales.\nRewards is a customer loyalty program that drives sales and traffic for the Famous Footwear segment. Rewards members earn points toward savings certificates for qualifying purchases. Upon reaching specified point values, members are issued a savings certificate, which may be redeemed for purchases at Famous Footwear. Approximately 78% of our fiscal 2019 sales within the Famous Footwear segment were generated by our Rewards members. If our Rewards members do not continue to shop at Famous Footwear, our sales may be adversely affected.\nOur business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected by the failure of financial institutions to fulfill their commitments under our Credit Agreement.\nThe Third Amendment to our Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), which matures on January 18, 2024, is provided by a syndicate of financial institutions, with each institution agreeing severally (and not jointly) to make revolving credit loans to us in an aggregate amount of up to $500.0 million in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Credit Agreement provides for an increase at the Company's option by up to $250.0 million. As a result of COVID-19, many companies are relying on bank funding for working capital needs. If one or more of the financial institutions participating in the Credit Agreement were to default on its obligation to fund its commitment, the portion of the facility provided by such defaulting financial institution may not be available to us.\nIf we are unable to maintain our credit rating, our ability to access capital and interest rates may be negatively impacted.\nThe credit rating agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings. Any negative ratings actions, such as the March 2020 downgrades of our credit rating by Moody's and S&P, could constrain the capital available to us or our industry and could limit our access to long-term funding or cause such access to be available at a higher borrowing cost for our operations. We are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive. If our ability to access capital becomes constrained, our interest expense will likely increase, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, as of February 1, 2020, total borrowing availability under the Credit Agreement was $214.1 million. Failure to meet our debt covenants under the Credit Agreement may require the Company to seek waivers or amendments of the debt covenants, alternative or additional sources of financing or reduce expenditures.", "PERMNO": 10866, "SIC": 3140, "TIC": "CAL"}
