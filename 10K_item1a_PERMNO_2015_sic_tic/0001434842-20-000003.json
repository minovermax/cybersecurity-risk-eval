{"cik": "1434842", "company": "Forbes Energy Services Ltd.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nThe following information describes certain significant risks and uncertainties inherent in our business. You should take these risks into account when evaluating us. This section does not describe all risks applicable to us, our industry or our business, and it is intended only as a summary of known material risks that are specific to the Company. You should carefully consider such risks and uncertainties together with the other information contained in this Form 10-K. If any of such risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could be harmed substantially and could differ materially from the plans and other forward-looking statements included in Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and elsewhere herein.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE FORBES MERGER\nThere can be no assurances when or if the Mergers will be completed.\nAlthough we expect to complete the Mergers in the second quarter of 2020, there can be no assurances as to the exact timing of completion of the Mergers or that the Mergers will be completed at all. The completion of the Mergers is subject to customary approvals and conditions, many of which are outside of our control. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the conditions required to complete the Mergers will be satisfied or waived on the anticipated schedule, or at all. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay Superior a termination fee.\nCompany stockholders will experience a reduction in percentage ownership and voting power in Newco as a result of the Mergers.\nCompany stockholders will experience a substantial reduction in their percentage ownership interests and effective voting power in respect of Newco relative to their percentage ownership interests in the Company prior to the Mergers. Consequently, Company stockholders should expect to exercise less influence over the management and policies of Newco following the Mergers than they currently exercise over the management and policies of the Company.\nThe Forbes Merger may trigger certain \u201cchange of control\u201d provisions and other restrictions in contracts of the Company and the failure to obtain any required consents or waivers could adversely impact Newco.\nCertain agreements of the Company will or may require the consent or waiver of one or more counterparties in connection with the Forbes Merger. The failure to obtain any such consent or waiver may permit such counterparties to terminate, or otherwise increase their rights or the Company\u2019s obligations under, any such agreement because the Forbes Merger may violate an anti-assignment, change of control or similar provision relating to any of such transactions. If this occurs, the Company may have to seek to replace that agreement with a new agreement or seek an amendment to such agreement. The Company cannot assure you that it will be able to replace or amend any such agreement on comparable terms or at all. If any such agreement is material, the failure to obtain consents, amendments or waivers under, or to replace on similar terms or at all, any of these agreements could adversely affect the financial performance or results of operations of Newco following the Mergers.\nIf the Mergers do not close, Forbes will not benefit from the expenses incurred in its pursuit.\nThe Mergers may not be completed. If the Mergers are not completed, the Company will have incurred substantial expenses for which no ultimate benefit will have been received. The Company has incurred out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the Mergers for investment banking, legal and accounting fees and other related charges, much of which will be incurred even if the Mergers are not completed.\nThe termination of the Merger Agreement, or failure to otherwise complete the Mergers, could negatively impact the Company, including impairing its ability to continue as a going concern.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated, or the Company fails to complete the Mergers, there may be various consequences, including that the Company\u2019s business may have been adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Mergers, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the transaction.\nThe Company has incurred substantial net losses and losses from operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $5.2 million and positive working capital of approximately $9.2 million, after taking into account that the mandatorily convertible notes of $58.6 million will not result in a cash settlement. While the Company has access to a working capital facility that is based on the Company\u2019s accounts receivable, as of December 31, 2019, only $4.1 million was available to borrow under such facility. The Company\u2019s Revolving Loan is also due January 2021. Recent negotiations to extend the maturity date have not been successful and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to negotiate an extension on the current Revolving Loan or have sufficient funds to repay such obligations when they come due. In addition, the Company has outstanding $58.6 million of mandatorily convertible PIK notes due November 30, 2020 (the \u201cPIK Notes\u201d), but does not at present have sufficient authorized common share capital to fully convert the PIK Notes upon maturity or other mandatory conversion event, such as change in control. In addition, the Company may not have access to other sources of external capital on reasonable terms or at all. We also expect to experience continued volatility in market demand\nwhich create normal oil and gas price fluctuations as well as external market pressures due to effects of global health concerns such as the recent outbreak of COVID-19 and the precipitous decline in oil prices that are not within our control. As a result of these and other factors, there is substantial doubt that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern. If the Mergers are not completed, these concerns will be heightened, and there can be no assurance that alternative strategic plans will provide sufficient liquidity for the Company to continue its operations.\nIn addition, a termination of the Merger Agreement or any failure to otherwise complete the Mergers may result in various consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nour business may have been adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Mergers, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Mergers.\n\u2022\nour management has and will continue to expend a significant amount of capital and time and resources on the Mergers, and a failure to consummate the Mergers as currently contemplated could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations;\n\u2022\nthe market price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the market price prior to the closing of the Mergers reflects a market assumption that the Mergers will be completed;\n\u2022\nwe may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay Superior a termination fee equal to $1.0 million under the Merger Agreement, which could adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity; and\n\u2022\nnegative reactions from the financial markets may occur if the anticipated return on our investment in Newco is not realized.\nIf the Mergers are not consummated, we cannot assure our stockholders that the risks described above will not negatively impact our business or financial results.\nWe are subject to business uncertainties with respect to our operations until the Mergers close.\nIn connection with the pendency of the Mergers, it is possible that some customers, suppliers and other persons with whom we have a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us, as the case may be, as a result of the Mergers, which could negatively affect our revenues, earnings and cash flows, as well as the market price of our common stock, regardless of whether the Mergers are completed. Such risks may be exacerbated by delays or other adverse developments with respect to the completion of the Mergers.\nUncertainties associated with the Mergers may distract management personnel and other key employees and divert their attention away from growing our business, which could adversely affect our future business and operations.\nWe are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to execute our business plans. Prior to completion of the Mergers, as a result of our expected management changes, our current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their roles following the completion of the Mergers, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to attract or retain key management and other key personnel.\nPotential litigation against us or Superior could result in an injunction preventing the completion of the Mergers or a judgment resulting in the payment of damages.\nStockholders of our company and/or Superior may file lawsuits against us or Superior, respectively, and/or the directors and officers of such companies in connection with the Mergers. As of the date of this filing, there have been no such lawsuits filed against either Superior or us. However, if filed in the future, these lawsuits could prevent or delay the completion of the Mergers and result in significant costs to us, including any costs associated with the indemnification of directors and officers. The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim against us that remains unresolved at the time the Mergers is completed may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSome of our executive officers have interests in the Mergers that are different from the interests of our stockholders generally.\nSome of our executive officers have interests in the Mergers that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally. These interests may include vesting of their equity awards in connection with the consummation of the Mergers.\nIf the Mergers are completed, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits.\nThe success of Newco, in its combination of the Superior U.S. Business with our business as a result of the Mergers, will depend, in part, on Newco\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the Superior U.S. Business with the Company\u2019s business. There can be no assurance that the Superior U.S. Business and the Company will be able to successfully integrate, which may negatively impact our combination with the Superior U.S. Business. Difficulties in integrating the Superior U.S. Business and the Company may result in Newco performing differently than expected, in operational challenges, or in the failure to realize anticipated expense-related efficiencies that may have a negative impact on integration of Newco.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nThe industry in which we operate is highly volatile and dependent on domestic spending by the oil and natural gas industry, and continued and prolonged reductions in oil and natural gas prices and in the overall level of exploration and development activities may further reduce our levels of utilization, demand for our services, or pricing for our services.\nThe levels of utilization, demand, pricing, and terms for oilfield services in our existing or future service areas largely depend upon the level of exploration and development activity for both crude oil and natural gas in the United States. Oil and natural gas industry conditions are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including oil and natural gas prices, expectations about future oil and natural gas prices, levels of supply and consumer demand, the cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and natural gas, the expected rates of current production, the discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves, available pipeline and other oil and natural gas transportation capacity, political instability in oil and natural gas producing countries, merger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers, political, regulatory and economic conditions, and the ability of oil and natural gas companies to raise equity capital or debt financing. Any addition to, or elimination or curtailment of, government incentives for companies involved in the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas could have a significant effect on the oilfield services industry in the United States.\nOur operations may be materially affected by severe weather conditions, such as hurricanes, drought, or extreme temperatures. Such events could result in evacuation of personnel, suspension of operations or damage to equipment and facilities. Damage from adverse weather conditions could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBeginning in October 2014 and through the first half of 2017, oil prices worldwide dropped significantly. While market conditions generally improved somewhat in the second half of 2017 and continued through the beginning of 2019, oil prices dropped precipitously in the first quarter of 2020. Continued unusually low or significant further reduction in commodity prices could cause the cancellation or curtailment of additional drilling programs and the lowering of production spending on existing wells in the future. Lower oil and natural gas prices could also cause our customers to seek to terminate, renegotiate, or fail to honor our service contracts.\nA continued and prolonged reduction in the overall level of exploration and development activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and natural gas prices or otherwise, could materially and adversely affect us by negatively impacting:\n\u2022\nour revenues, cash flows and profitability;\n\u2022\nthe fair market value of our equipment fleet;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional capital to finance our business and make acquisitions, and the cost of that capital;\n\u2022\nthe collectability of our receivables; and\n\u2022\nour ability to retain skilled personnel whom we would need in the event of an upturn in the demand for our services.\nThe ongoing decrease in utilization, demand for our services and pricing has had, and if it continues will continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nManagement has determined that certain factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and our continued existence is dependent upon our ability to successfully execute our business plan.\nThe financial statements included with this report are presented under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business over a reasonable length of time. Management has determined that certain factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, such as incurring substantial net losses and losses from operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $5.2 million. While the Company has access to a working capital facility that is based on the Company\u2019s accounts receivable, as of December 31, 2019, $4.1 million was available to borrow under such facility. The Company\u2019s Revolving Loan is due January 2021, which is within the 12-month going concern evaluation period. Current negotiations to extend the maturity date have not been successful and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to negotiate an extension on the current Revolving Loan or have sufficient funds to repay such obligations when they come due. As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding balance on the Revolving Loan is $4.0 million. An additional uncertainty for the Company relates to the possibility, absent the approval by the Company\u2019s stockholders of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, that there will not be sufficient authorized common shares to fully convert the $58.6 million accrued amount of PIK notes. In addition, the Company may not have access to other sources of external capital on reasonable terms or at all. We also expect to continue to experience volatility in market demand which create normal oil and gas price fluctuations as well as external market pressures due to effects of global health concerns such as COVID-19 and the recent oil price war triggered by Russia and Saudi Arabia, that are not within our control. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainties.\nOur business may be adversely affected by a deterioration in general economic conditions or a weakening of the broader energy industry.\nA prolonged economic slowdown or recession in the United States, adverse events relating to the energy industry or regional, national and global economic conditions and factors, particularly a further or renewed slowdown in the oil and gas industry, could negatively impact our operations and therefore adversely affect our results. The risks associated with our business are more acute during periods of economic slowdown or recession because such periods may be accompanied by decreased exploration and development spending by our customers, decreased demand for oil and gas and decreased prices for oil and gas. The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has also resulted in increased volatility in financial and commodity markets, as well as decreased prices for oil and gas as a result of suspension of certain travel and industrial activity.\nWe extend credit to our customers which presents a risk of non-payment.\nA substantial portion of our accounts receivable are with customers involved in the oil and natural gas industry, whose revenues are also affected by fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices, including the substantial decline in oil prices in recent periods. Collection of some of these receivables will be more difficult, and due to economic factors affecting this industry, we may experience an increase in uncollectible accounts. Failure to collect a significant level of receivables from one or more customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe market for oil and natural gas may be adversely affected by global demands to curtail use of such fuels.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas and technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce the demand for oil and other liquid hydrocarbons. We cannot predict the effect of changing demand for oil and natural gas products, and any major changes may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to maintain or increase pricing on our core services.\nWe may periodically seek to increase the prices on our services to offset rising costs or to generate higher returns for our stockholders. However, we operate in a very competitive industry and, as a result, we are not always successful in raising or maintaining our existing prices. Additionally, during periods of increased market demand, a significant amount of new service capacity may enter the market, which also puts pressure on the pricing of our services and limits our ability to increase prices.\nEven when we are able to increase our prices, we may not be able to do so at a rate that is sufficient to offset such rising costs. In periods of high demand for oilfield services, a tighter labor market may result in higher labor costs. During such periods, our labor costs could increase at a greater rate than our ability to raise prices for our services. Also, we may not be able to successfully increase prices without adversely affecting our activity levels. The inability to maintain or increase our pricing as costs increase could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations.\nOur customer base is concentrated within the oil and natural gas production industry and loss one or more significant customers could cause our revenue to decline substantially.\nWe served 504 customers for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our largest customer Chesapeake Energy comprised approximately 10% of our total revenues; our five largest customers comprised approximately 36% of our total revenues; and our ten largest customers comprised approximately 45% of our total revenues, respectively. Our top 100 customers amounted to approximately 92% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. The loss of our top customer or of several of our top customers would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. We may be able to replace customers lost with other customers, but there can be no assurance that lost revenues could be replaced in a timely manner with the same margins or, perhaps, at all.\nOur Term Loans, PIK Notes, and operating lease commitments could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our long-term debt, including current portions, net of debt discount, was $134.7 million and our commitment for operating leases was $6.2 million. In the event a decline in activity is encountered, our level of indebtedness and lease payment obligations may adversely affect operations and limit our growth. Our level of indebtedness and lease payment obligations may affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u2022\nby increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\ndue to the fact that the covenants that are contained in the Term Loan Agreement limit our ability to borrow funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments;\n\u2022\ndue to the fact that any failure to comply with the covenants of the Term Loan Agreement (including failure to make the required interest payments) could result and has in the past resulted in an event of default under the Term Loan Agreement,\nwhich, if not remedied, would result in all outstanding indebtedness due under the Term Loan Agreement becoming immediately due and payable;\n\u2022\ndue to the fact that our level of debt may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to make payments with respect to our indebtedness and lease commitments as they become due. If we fail to generate sufficient cash flow from future operations to meet any such obligations, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any debt that we have incurred or may incur in the future on attractive terms, commercially reasonably terms, or at all. Our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance any indebtedness will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt and leasing obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, we would be in default, which could result in an acceleration of any such indebtedness, the termination of lenders\u2019 commitments to loan money and, in the case of secured indebtedness, allow the applicable lenders to foreclose against the assets securing such indebtedness.\nThese restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows, and the ability to satisfy the obligations under the Term Loan Agreement. Accordingly, an event of default could result in all or a portion of our outstanding debt under our debt agreements becoming immediately due and payable. If this occurred, we might not be able to obtain waivers or secure alternative financing to satisfy all of our obligations simultaneously, which would adversely affect our business and operations.\nImpairment of our long-term assets may adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.\nWe have recorded asset impairment charges in the past, as well as during the year ended December 31, 2019. We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, including our property and equipment, and intangible assets. In performing these assessments, we project future cash flows on an undiscounted basis for long-lived assets and compare these cash flows to the carrying amount of the related assets. These cash flow projections are based on our current operating plans, estimates and judgmental assumptions. We perform the assessment of potential impairment for our property and equipment and intangibles whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable due to various external or internal factors. In such event, if we determine that our estimates of future cash flows were inaccurate or our actual results are materially different from what we have predicted, we could record additional impairment charges in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive.\nThe oilfield services industry is highly competitive and we compete with a substantial number of companies, some of which have greater technical and financial resources than we have. Examples of our larger competitors performing both well servicing and fluid logistics are Basic Energy Services, Inc., Superior Energy Services, Inc., Key Energy Services, Inc., and C&J Energy Services, Inc. Our largest competitor that competes with our fluid logistics segment is Stallion Oilfield Services, Ltd. Our ability to generate revenues and earnings depends primarily upon our ability to win bids in competitive bidding processes and to perform awarded projects within estimated times and costs. There can be no assurance that competitors will not substantially increase the resources devoted to the development and marketing of products and services that compete with ours or that new or existing competitors will not enter the various markets in which we are active. In certain aspects of our business, we also compete with a number of small and medium-sized companies that, like us, have certain competitive advantages such as low overhead costs and specialized regional strengths. Although activity increased in 2018 and 2019, before declining significantly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and recent substantial decline in oil prices, it is presently at reduced levels compared to prior years. These levels continue to result in pricing pressure in certain markets and lines of business and may result in lower revenues or margins to us.\nThe Term Loan Agreement imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us that may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and restrict or limit our ability to operate our business.\nThe Term Loan Agreement contains covenants that restrict or limit our ability to take various actions, such as:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate or suffer to exist liens;\n\u2022\nenter into leases for equipment or real property;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nmerge, consolidate, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions on our capital stock;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nengage or enter into any new lines of business;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem, retire or repurchase certain of our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nform a subsidiary; and\n\u2022\namend, modify or waive certain provisions of our (and our subsidiaries\u2019) organizational documents.\nIn addition, our Term Loan Agreement requires us to satisfy certain financial conditions, some of which become more restrictive over time, and may require us to reduce our debt or take some other action in order to comply with them. The failure to comply with any of these financial conditions, including the covenants, would cause a default under our Term Loan Agreement. A default under any of our indebtedness, if not waived, could result in the acceleration of such indebtedness or other indebtedness, in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable. In the event of any acceleration of our indebtedness, we may not be able to pay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it, and any holders of secured indebtedness may seek to foreclose on the assets securing such indebtedness. Even if new financing is available, it may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us. These restrictions could also limit our ability to obtain future financings, make needed capital expenditures, withstand a downturn in our business or the economy in general, or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We also may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under our Term Loan Agreement or existing limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, including in connection with acquisitions. See Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for a discussion of our Term Loan Agreement.\nWe are subject to the risk of technological obsolescence.\nWe anticipate that our ability to maintain our current business and win new business will depend upon continuous improvements in operating equipment, among other things. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts in this regard or that we will have the resources available to continue to support this need to have our equipment remain technologically up to date and competitive. Our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. No assurances can be given that competitors will not achieve technological advantages over us.\nWe are highly dependent on certain of our officers, management and key employees.\nOur success is dependent upon our key management, technical and field personnel, especially John E. Crisp, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Steve Macek, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of FES, LLC. Any loss of the services of any of these officers, or managers with strong relationships with customers or suppliers, or a sufficient number of other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. Our ability to expand our services is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain additional qualified employees.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of being obligated to comply with Securities Exchange Act reporting requirements, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the Term Loan Agreement covenants and that our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance matters.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We also have incurred and will incur costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules implemented by the SEC. We will incur ongoing periodic expenses in connection with the administration of our organizational structure. The expenses incurred by public companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly, although we are currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. In estimating these costs, we took into account expenses related to insurance, legal, accounting, and compliance activities, as well as other expenses not currently incurred. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board, our Board committees or as our executive officers. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.\nWe engage in transactions with related parties and such transactions present possible conflicts of interest that could have an adverse effect on us.\nWe have historically entered into a significant number of transactions with related parties. The details of certain of these transactions are set forth in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Related party transactions create the possibility of conflicts of interest with regard to our management. Such a conflict could cause an individual in our management to seek to advance his or her economic interests above ours. Further, the appearance of conflicts of interest created by related party transactions could impair the confidence of our investors. Our Board has adopted a Related Persons Transaction Policy that requires the Audit Committee to approve or ratify related party transactions that involve consideration in excess of $120,000. Notwithstanding this, it is possible that a conflict of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nActivity in the oilfield services industry is affected by seasonal and cyclical factors that may impact our revenues during certain periods.\nOur operations are impacted by seasonal factors. Historically, our business has been negatively impacted during the winter months due to inclement weather, fewer daylight hours, and holidays. Our well servicing rigs are mobile and we operate a significant number of oilfield vehicles. During periods of heavy snow, ice or rain, we may not be able to move our equipment between locations, thereby reducing our ability to generate rig or truck hours. In addition, the majority of our well servicing rigs work only during daylight hours. In the winter months as daylight time becomes shorter, the amount of time that the well servicing rigs work is shortened, which has a negative impact on total hours worked. Finally, we historically have experienced significant slowdown during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday seasons.\nIn addition, the oil and natural gas industry has traditionally been volatile and is influenced by a combination of long-term, short-term and cyclical trends, including the domestic and international supply and demand for oil and natural gas, current and expected future prices for oil and natural gas and the perceived stability and sustainability of those prices. Such cyclical trends also include the resultant levels of cash flows generated and allocated by exploration and production companies to their drilling, completion and workover budget. The volatility of the oil and natural gas industry and the precipitous decline in oil and natural gas prices have negatively impacted the level of exploration and production activity and capital expenditures by our customers. This has adversely affected, and in the future may adversely affect, the demand for our services, which has had, and if it continues, will continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe rely heavily on our suppliers and do not maintain written agreements with any suppliers.\nOur ability to compete and grow will be dependent on our access to equipment, including well servicing rigs, parts, and components, among other things, at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. We do not maintain written agreements with any of our suppliers (other than leases for certain equipment), and we are, therefore, dependent on the relationships we maintain with them. Failure of suppliers to deliver such equipment, parts and components at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner would be detrimental to our ability to maintain existing customers and obtain new customers. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in maintaining our required supply of such items.\nThe source and supply of materials has been consistent in the past, however, in periods of high industry activity, periodic shortages of certain materials have been experienced and costs have been affected. If current or future suppliers are unable to provide the necessary raw materials, or otherwise fail to deliver products in the quantities required, any resulting delays in the provision of services to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe do not maintain current written agreements with respect to some of our salt water disposal wells.\nOur ability to continue to provide well maintenance services depends on our continued access to salt water disposal wells. Many of our currently active salt water disposal wells are not subject to written operating agreements or are located on the premises of third parties with whom we do not have a current written lease. We do not maintain current written surface leases or right of way agreements with these third parties and we are, therefore, dependent on the relationships we maintain with them. Failure to maintain relationships with these third parties could impair our ability to access and maintain the applicable salt water disposal wells and any well servicing equipment located on their property. If that occurred, we would increase the levels of fluid injection at our remaining salt water disposal wells and would need to use additional third party disposal wells at substantial additional cost. Additionally, our permits to inject fluid into the salt water disposal wells are subject to maximum pressure limitations and if multiple salt water disposal wells became unavailable, this might adversely impact our operations.\nDue to the nature of our business, we may be subject to environmental liability.\nOur business operations and ownership of real property are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, including those relating to emissions to air, discharges to water, treatment, storage and disposal of regulated materials, and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. The nature of our business, including operations at our current and former facilities by prior owners, lessors or operators, exposes us to risks of liability under these laws\nand regulations due to the production, generation, storage, use, transportation, and disposal of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment or if certain types of exposures occur. Environmental laws and regulations may have a significant effect on the costs of transportation and storage of raw materials as well as the costs of the transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal of wastes. We believe we are in material compliance with applicable environmental and worker health and safety requirements. However, we may incur substantial costs, including fines, penalties, damages, criminal or civil sanctions, remediation costs, or experience interruptions in our operations for violations or liabilities arising under these laws and regulations. Although we may have the benefit of insurance maintained by our customers, by other third parties or by us, such insurances may not cover every expense. Further, we may become liable for damages against which we cannot adequately insure, or against which we may elect not to insure, because of high costs or other reasons.\nOur customers are subject to similar environmental laws and regulations, as well as limits on emissions to the air and discharges into surface and sub-surface waters. Although regulatory developments that may occur in subsequent years could have the effect of reducing industry activity, we cannot predict the nature of any new restrictions or regulations that may be imposed. We may be required to increase operating expenses or capital expenditures in order to comply with any new restrictions or regulations.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our services.\nContinued political attention to issues concerning climate change, the role of human activity in it, and potential mitigation through regulation could have a material impact on our operations and financial results. International agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation. These and other greenhouse gas emissions-related laws, policies, and regulations may result in substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs. Material price increases or incentives to conserve or use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for services that we currently provide and adversely affect our operations and financial results. The ultimate financial impact associated with compliance with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction, our activities in those jurisdictions and market conditions.\nSignificant physical effects of climatic change, if they should occur, have the potential to damage oil and natural gas facilities, disrupt production activities and could cause us or our customers to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nIn an interpretative guidance on climate change disclosures, the SEC indicated that climate change could have an effect on the severity of weather (including hurricanes and floods), sea levels, the arability of farmland, and water availability and quality. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations or the assets and operations of our customers. We may not be able to recover through insurance some or any of the damages, losses, or costs that may result should the potential physical effects of climate change occur. Unrecovered damages and losses incurred by our customers could result in decreased demand for our services.\nIncreasing trucking regulations may increase our costs and negatively affect our results of operations.\nIn connection with the services we provide, we operate as a motor carrier and, therefore, are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation, or U.S. DOT, and by various state agencies. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations and regulatory safety. There are additional regulations specifically relating to the trucking industry, including testing and specification of equipment and product handling requirements. The trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services. Some of these possible changes include increasingly stringent environmental regulations and changes in the regulations that govern the amount of time a driver may drive in any specific period, onboard black box recorder devices, or limits on vehicle weight and size.\nInterstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the U.S. DOT. To a large degree, intrastate motor carrier operations are subject to state safety regulations that mirror federal regulations. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations.\nFrom time to time, various legislative proposals are introduced, including proposals to increase federal, state, or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, which may increase our costs or adversely affect the recruitment of drivers. Management cannot predict whether, or in what form, any increase in such taxes applicable to us will be enacted. We may be required to increase operating expenses or capital expenditures in order to comply with any new restrictions or regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulation.\nIn addition to environmental and trucking regulations, our operations are subject to a variety of other federal, state, and local laws, regulations and guidelines, including laws and regulations relating to health and safety, the conduct of operations, and the manufacture, management, transportation, storage and disposal of certain materials used in our operations. Also, we may become\nsubject to such regulation in any new jurisdiction in which we may operate. We believe that we are in material compliance with such laws, regulations and guidelines.\nWe have invested financial and managerial resources to comply with applicable laws, regulations and guidelines and expect to continue to do so in the future. Although regulatory expenditures have not historically been material to us, such laws, regulations and guidelines are subject to change. Accordingly, it is impossible for us to predict the cost or effect of such laws, regulations, or guidelines on our future operations.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nIn general, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) and certain tax credits, to offset future taxable income and tax. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders changes by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders\u2019 lowest percentage of ownership during the testing period (generally three years).\nIn connection with our emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in 2017, we experienced an ownership change for the purposes of Sec. 382 of the Code. At December 31, 2019, we estimate that we have $106.6 million gross NOLs. Any subsequent ownership changes under the provisions of Section 382 could further adversely affect the use of our NOLs in future periods.\nOur operations are inherently risky, and insurance may not always be available at commercially justifiable rates or in amounts sufficient to fully protect us.\nWe have an insurance and risk management program in place to protect our assets, operations, and employees. We also have programs in place to address compliance with current safety and regulatory standards. However, our operations are subject to risks inherent in the oilfield services industry, such as equipment defects, malfunctions, failures, accidents, and natural disasters. In addition, hazards such as unusual or unexpected geological formations, pressures, blow-outs, fires, or other conditions may be encountered in drilling and servicing wells, as well as the transportation of fluids and company assets between locations. These risks and hazards could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, property damage or destruction, pollution, and other environmental damages.\nAlthough we have obtained insurance against certain of these risks, such insurance is subject to coverage limits and exclusions and may not be available for the risks and hazards to which we are exposed. In addition, no assurance can be given that such insurance will be adequate to cover our liabilities or will be generally available in the future or, if available, that premiums will be commercially justifiable or that such coverage may not require us to accept additional deductibles. If we were to incur substantial liability and such damages were not covered by insurance or were in excess of policy limits, or if we were to incur such liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents that may discourage a change of control.\nOur organizational documents contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our Board. These provisions provide for the following:\n\u2022\nrequirements that our Board be divided into three classes, serving in staggered three year terms, which may not be altered or repealed without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the shares entitled to vote in an election of directors;\n\u2022\nrequirements that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of such stockholders and may not be effected by consent in writing by such stockholders;\n\u2022\nrequirements that special meetings of stockholders may be called only by our Chief Executive Officer, our Chairman of the Board, or our Board;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the ability of a person who would be an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (as defined in our Certificate of Incorporation) to effect various business combinations with us for a three-year period;\n\u2022\nrequirements that if notice is provided for a stockholders meeting, other than an annual meeting, the business transacted at such meeting shall be limited to the matters so stated in our notice of meeting;\n\u2022\nrenouncement of the \u201ccorporate opportunity\u201d doctrine as it applies to certain stockholders and the affiliates of such stockholders; and\n\u2022\nrights to issue authorized but unissued shares of our common stock and/or any preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nIn addition, our organizational documents do not provide for cumulative voting with respect to the election of directors or any other matters, and cumulative voting is not otherwise provided under state law. All of the foregoing provisions could make it more\ndifficult for a third party to acquire, or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of us, even if the third party\u2019s offer was considered beneficial by many stockholders. As a result, these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of the Company that would otherwise be beneficial to investors.\nFuture legal proceedings could adversely affect us and our operations.\nGiven the nature of our business, we are involved in litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business. While we are not presently a party to any material legal proceedings, legal proceedings could be filed against us in the future. No assurance can be given as to the final outcome of any legal proceedings or that the ultimate resolution of any legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe may not be able to fully integrate future acquisitions.\nWe may undertake future acquisitions of businesses and assets in the ordinary course of business. Achieving the benefits of acquisitions depends in part on having the acquired assets perform as expected, successfully consolidating functions, retaining key employees and customer relationships, and integrating operations and procedures in a timely and efficient manner. Such integration may require substantial management effort, time, and resources and may divert management\u2019s focus from other strategic opportunities and operational matters, and ultimately we may fail to realize anticipated benefits of acquisitions.\nIn particular, the benefits that are expected to result from the Cretic Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the growth opportunities we anticipate from the Cretic Acquisition.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased cost and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand, and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Various governmental entities (within and outside the United States) are in the process of studying, restricting, regulating, or preparing to regulate hydraulic fracturing, directly and indirectly. Hydraulic fracturing operations are regulated through the underground injection control programs under the Safe Drinking Water Act and other environmental statutes. The EPA has adopted air emissions standards that apply to well completion activities. In June 2016, the EPA developed new standards for wastewater discharges associated with hydraulic fracturing and, in December 2016, completed a study on the impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater. In 2015, the Bureau of Land Management also enacted regulations for hydraulic fracturing activities that would be unique to federal lands. These rules were, however, struck down by a federal court in June 2016 that determined that BLM did not have authority over fracking operations pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Since then, legislation has been proposed that would provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. The legislation remains in committee and has not passed either house. In addition, many state governments now require the disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process and some jurisdictions have imposed an express or de facto ban on hydraulic fracturing. A law enacted by the Texas legislature and a rule enacted by The Railroad Commission of Texas in 2011 require disclosure regarding the composition of hydraulic fracturing products to certain parties, including The Railroad Commission of Texas. Furthermore, local groundwater districts may regulate the amount of groundwater that can be withdrawn and used for hydraulic fracturing operations. This could be a material issue due to the water-intensive nature of these operations. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for producers to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is regulated at the federal level, fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting requirements, and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Increased consumer activism against hydraulic fracturing or the prohibition or restriction of hydraulic fracturing on the part of our customers could potentially result in materially reduced demand for the Company\u2019s services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nCybersecurity breaches, hostile cyber intrusions, or business system disruptions may adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are highly dependent on digital technologies and services. Digital technologies and services are increasingly subject to cybersecurity threats such as unauthorized access to data and systems, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), computer viruses, and phishing and cyberattacks. Moreover, sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors now engage in intrusions and attacks and add to the risks to our internal data and systems.\nAlthough we seek to implement security measures to protect against such cybersecurity risks, there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent or detect every type of attempt or attack. In addition, a cyberattack or security breach could go undetected for an extended period of time. If our measures for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove insufficient, we could be adversely affected by, among other things: unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information, unauthorized release of customer or employee data, violation of privacy or other laws, and exposure to litigation. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, and financial condition.\nBusiness or economic disruptions or global health concerns beyond our control could seriously harm our business and results of operations.\nBroad-based business or economic disruptions could adversely affect our ongoing or planned business activities. For example, beginning in December 2019 an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China, and has since spread to a number of other countries, including the United States. The outbreak has prompted precautionary government-imposed closures of certain travel and businesses. We cannot presently predict the scope and severity of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions, but if we or any of the third parties with whom we engage were to experience shutdowns or other business disruptions, our ability to conduct our business in the manner and on the timelines presently planned could be materially and negatively impacted. The Company has not yet experienced any known business disruptions as a result of the coronavirus.", "PERMNO": 12963, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "FLSS"}
