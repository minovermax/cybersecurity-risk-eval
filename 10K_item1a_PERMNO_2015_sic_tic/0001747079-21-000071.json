RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following Risk Factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business.\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of our securities, including our common stock, could decline significantly, and investors could lose all or part of their investment.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Risks and General Economic Conditions\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has materially impacted our business, financial results and liquidity, and such impact could worsen and last for an unknown period of time.\nThe global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has been, and continues to be, complex and rapidly evolving, with governments, public institutions and other organizations imposing or recommending, and businesses and individuals implementing restrictions on various activities or other actions to combat its spread, such as restrictions and bans on travel or transportation, stay-at-home directives, requirements that individuals wear masks or other face coverings, limitations on the size of gatherings, closures of work facilities, schools, public buildings and businesses, cancellation of events, including sporting events, concerts, conferences and meetings, and quarantines and lock-downs. The pandemic and its consequences have dramatically reduced travel and demand for hotel rooms and other casino resort amenities, which has had a negative impact on our results for the 2020 fiscal year and continuing into 2021. In particular, all of our properties had previously been required to close and are currently operating under various reduced capacities and other operating restraints and will continue to do so for an undetermined period of time pursuant to various state and local government regulations, orders or directives.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, operations, and financial results, including the duration and magnitude of such effects, will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess, including the duration and scope of the pandemic (and whether there is a continued resurgence in new cases, hospitalizations or deaths in the future or when the vaccine or other therapeutics become widely available); the negative impact it has on global and regional economies and economic activity, including the duration and magnitude of its impact on unemployment rates and consumer discretionary spending; its short and longer-term impact on the demand for travel, transient and group business, and levels of consumer confidence even after travel advisories and restrictions are lifted; the ability of us and our business partners to successfully navigate the impacts of the pandemic; actions governments, businesses and individuals take in response to the pandemic, including limiting or banning travel and limiting or banning leisure, casino and entertainment activities; and how quickly economies, travel activity, and demand for gaming, entertainment and leisure activities recovers after the pandemic subsides. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of exacerbating many of the other risks described in this filing. As a result of the foregoing, we cannot predict the ultimate scope, duration and impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our results of operations, but we expect that it will continue to have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) and stock price.\nAll of the properties that we currently own, as well as those we have agreed to acquire, are currently operating at less than full capacity and without all available amenities, and we are unable to predict when all, or any of, such properties will return to pre-pandemic operating level, or the period of time required for the ramp-up of operations.\nAll of our properties and those we have agreed to acquire are currently operating under reduced capacity and other restrictions and without all available amenities pursuant to state and local government requirements as a result of the unprecedented public health crisis from the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, these properties are predominately generating less than pre-pandemic levels of revenue.\nWhile we have engaged in cost reduction efforts in connection with the restrictions, we still have significant fixed and variable expenses, which will adversely affect our profitability. Furthermore, while we are working closely with government officials on plans to fully re-open our properties when the government restrictions are lifted, we cannot predict the duration or any additional limitations the government or we may impose on our operations. Currently our operations include some combination of screening of employees and guests upon entrance of the properties, thermal imaging cameras, enforcement of social distancing guidelines, including spacing between VLTs and limited or no table games, frequent cleaning and sanitizing protocols for all areas, mask protection and public awareness signage. In addition, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, weakened demand at our properties in light of continued travel restrictions or warnings, consumer fears and reduced consumer discretionary spending and general economic uncertainty. In light of the foregoing, we are unable to determine when all our properties will return to pre-pandemic demand, but we expect that the impact may have a material\nimpact on our consolidated results of operations during 2021, particularly if new cases, hospitalizations and deaths in our markets continue to rise.\nWe have undertaken actions to reduce costs and improve efficiencies to mitigate losses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could negatively impact guest loyalty and our ability to attract and retain employees.\nAs a result of the closures we experienced in the second quarter of 2020, the current restrictions on operations at all of our properties and the continued uncertainty regarding the duration and severity of this pandemic, we have taken steps to reduce operating costs and improve efficiencies, including furloughing employees. Such steps, and further changes we may make in the future to reduce costs, may negatively impact guest loyalty or our ability to attract and retain employees, and our reputation may suffer as a result. For example, if all of our furloughed employees do not return to work with us when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, including because they find new employment during the furlough, we may experience operational challenges that may impact our ability to resume operations in full. We may also face demands or requests from labor unions that represent our employees, whether in the course of our periodic renegotiation of our collective bargaining agreements, through effects bargaining relating to the shut down and/or reopening of our operations, or otherwise, for additional compensation, healthcare benefits or other terms as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that could increase costs, and we could experience labor disputes or disruptions as we continue to implement our COVID-19 mitigation plans. These properties we have agreed to acquire face similar challenges.\nOur business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending.\nOur business is particularly sensitive to reductions from time to time in discretionary consumer spending. Demand for entertainment and leisure activities, including gaming, can be affected by changes in the economy and consumer tastes, both of which are difficult to predict and beyond our control. Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, including recessions, economic slowdowns, sustained high levels of unemployment, and rising prices or the perception by consumers of weak or weakening economic conditions, may reduce our users\u2019 disposable income or result in fewer individuals engaging in entertainment and leisure activities, such as visiting casinos and casino hotel properties, daily fantasy sports, sports betting and iGaming. Moreover, we rely on the strength of regional and local economies for the performance of each of our properties. As a result, we cannot ensure that demand for our offerings will remain constant. Adverse developments affecting economies throughout the world including a general tightening of the availability of credit, increasing energy costs, rising prices, inflation, acts of war or terrorism, natural disasters, declining consumer confidence, significant declines in the stock market or epidemics, pandemics or other health-related events or widespread illnesses, like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could lead to a reduction in visitors to our properties, including those that stay in our hotels, or discretionary spending by our customers on entertainment and leisure activities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition\nThe gaming industry is very competitive and increased competition, including through legislative legalization or expansion of gaming by states in or near where we own facilities or through Native American gaming facilities and internet gaming, could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe face significant competition in all of the areas in which we conduct our business. Increased competitive pressures may adversely affect our ability to continue to attract customers or affect our ability to compete efficiently.\nSeveral of the facilities where we conduct our business are located in jurisdictions that restrict gaming to certain areas and/or may be affected by state laws that currently prohibit or restrict gaming operations. We also face the risk that existing casino licensees will expand their operations and the risk that Native American gaming will continue to grow. Budgetary and other political pressures faced by state governments could lead to intensified efforts directed at the legalization of gaming in jurisdictions where it is currently prohibited. The legalization of gaming in such jurisdictions could be an expansion opportunity for our business, or create competitive pressures, depending on where the legalization occurs and our ability to capitalize on it. Our ability to attract customers to the existing casinos which we own could be significantly and adversely affected by the legalization or expansion of gaming in certain jurisdictions and by the development or expansion of Native American casinos in areas where our customers may visit.\nIn addition, our competitors may refurbish, rebrand or expand their casino offerings, which could result in increased competition. Furthermore, changes in ownership may result in improved quality of our competitors\u2019 facilities, which may make such facilities more competitive. Certain of our competitors are large gaming companies with greater name recognition and marketing and financial resources. In some instances, particularly in the case of Native American casinos, our competitors pay lower taxes or no taxes. These factors create additional challenges for us in competing for customers and accessing cash flow or financing to fund improvements for our casino and entertainment products that enable us to remain competitive.\nWe also compete with other forms of legalized gaming and entertainment such as bingo, pull-tab games, card parlors, sports books, pari-mutuel or simulcast betting on horse and dog racing, state-sponsored lotteries, instant racing machines, VLTs (including racetracks that offer VLTs), and video poker terminals and, in the future, we may compete with gaming or entertainment at other venues. Further competition from internet lotteries and other internet wagering gaming services, which allow their customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play Las Vegas-style casino games from home, could divert customers from the facilities we own and thus adversely affect our business. Such internet wagering services are likely to expand in future years and become more accessible to domestic gamblers as a result of U.S. Department of Justice positions related to the application of federal laws to intrastate internet gaming and initiatives in some states to consider legislation to legalize intrastate internet wagering. The law in this area has been rapidly evolving, and additional legislative developments may occur at the federal and state levels that would accelerate the proliferation of certain forms of internet gaming in the United States.\nIn addition, in May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992, a federal statute enacted to stop the spread of state-sponsored sports gambling. This decision has the effect of lifting federal restrictions on sports wagering and thus allows states to determine by themselves the legality of sports wagering. While new federal online gaming legislation has been introduced in Congress from time to time, there has been no federal legislative response to the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\nAs a result, numerous states, including states we operate in currently in Rhode Island, Delaware, Mississippi, Colorado and Indiana have passed legislation authorizing fixed-odds sports betting. Our Rhode Island, Delaware, Mississippi and Indiana properties now offer sports wagering pursuant to state law in each case and the properties we have recently acquired in Black Hawk, Colorado will also offer sports wagering.\nWe may also face competition from other gaming facilities which are able to offer sports wagering services (including mobile sports wagering) following the enactment of applicable legislation. Numerous states that border the states in which we operate have pending or proposed legislation which would allow for sports betting, each of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nCompliance, Regulatory and Legal Risks\nWe are subject to extensive state and local regulation and licensing, and gaming authorities have significant control over our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur ownership and operation of casino gaming, horse racing facilities, sports betting, VLTs and online offerings are subject to extensive state and local regulation, and regulatory authorities at the state and local levels have broad powers with respect to the licensing of these businesses, and may revoke, suspend, condition, fail to renew or limit our gaming or other licenses, impose substantial fines and take other actions, each of which poses a significant risk to our business, results of operations and financial condition. We currently hold all state and local licenses and related approvals necessary to conduct our present operations, but must periodically apply to renew many of these licenses and registrations and have the suitability of certain of our directors, officers and employees renewed. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such renewals or that we will be able to obtain future approvals that would allow us to expand our gaming operations. Any failure to maintain or renew existing licenses, registrations, permits or approvals would have a material adverse effect on us. As we expand our gaming operations in our existing jurisdictions or to new areas, we may have to meet additional suitability requirements and obtain additional licenses, registrations, permits and approvals from gaming authorities in these jurisdictions. The approval process can be time-consuming and costly, and we cannot be sure that we will be successful. In addition, the loss of a license in one jurisdiction could trigger the loss of a license or affect our eligibility for a license in another jurisdiction. Furthermore, if additional gaming laws or regulations are adopted in jurisdictions where we operate, these regulations could impose additional restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us.\nGaming authorities in the U.S. generally can require that any beneficial owner of our securities file an application for a finding of suitability. If a gaming authority requires a record or beneficial owner of our securities to file a suitability application, the owner must generally apply for a finding of suitability within 30 days or at an earlier time prescribed by the gaming authority. The gaming authority has the power to investigate such an owner\u2019s suitability and the owner must pay all costs of the investigation. If the owner is found unsuitable, then the owner may be required by law to dispose of our securities.\nOur officers, directors and key employees are also subject to a variety of regulatory requirements and various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we manage gaming facilities. If any applicable gaming authority were to find any of our officers, directors, or key employees unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would have to sever all relationships with that person. Furthermore, the applicable gaming authority may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Either result could adversely affect our gaming operations.\nApplicable gaming laws and regulations may restrict our ability to issue certain securities, incur debt and undertake other financing activities. Such transactions would generally require notice and/or approval of applicable gaming authorities, and our financing counterparties, including lenders, might be subject to various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we manage gaming facilities. Applicable gaming laws further limit our ability to engage in certain competitive activities and impose requirements relating to the composition of our board of directors and senior management personnel. If state regulatory authorities were to find any person unsuitable with regard to his, her or its relationship to us or any of our subsidiaries, we would be required to sever our relationship with that person, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws that may expose us to liabilities or have a significant adverse impact on our operations. Changes to any such laws could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Changes to any of the laws, rules, regulations or ordinances to which we are subject, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nMany of our employees, especially those that interact with our customers, receive a base salary or wage that is established by applicable state and federal laws that establish a minimum hourly wage that is, in turn, supplemented through tips and gratuities from customers. From time to time, state and federal lawmakers have increased the minimum wage. It is difficult to predict when such increases may take place. Any such change to the minimum wage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe sale of alcoholic beverages is a highly regulated and taxed business. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the production and distribution of alcoholic beverages, including permitting, licensing, trade practices, labeling, advertising, marketing, distributor relationships and related matters. Federal, state and local governmental entities also levy various taxes, license fees, and other similar charges and may require bonds to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable federal, state or local laws and regulations could result in higher taxes, penalties, fees, and suspension or revocation of permits, licenses or approvals and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. From time to time, local and state lawmakers, as well as special interest groups, have proposed legislation that would increase the federal and/or state excise tax on alcoholic beverages or certain types of alcoholic beverages. If federal or state excise taxes are increased, we may have to raise prices to maintain our current profit margins. Higher taxes may reduce overall demand for alcoholic beverages, thus negatively impacting sales of our alcoholic beverages at our properties. Further federal or state regulation may be forthcoming that could further restrict the distribution and sale of alcohol products. Any material increases in taxes or fees, or the adoption of additional taxes, fees or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nLegislation in various forms to ban or substantially curtail indoor tobacco smoking in public places has been enacted or introduced in many states and local jurisdictions, including some of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We believe the smoking restrictions can significantly impact business volumes. If additional smoking restrictions are enacted within jurisdictions where we operate or seek to do business, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, each restaurant we operate must obtain a food service license from local authorities. Failure to comply with such regulations could cause our licenses to be revoked or our related restaurant business or businesses to be forced to cease operations. Moreover, state liquor laws may prevent the expansion of restaurant operations into certain markets.\nWe handle significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Recently, U.S. governmental authorities have evidenced an increased focus on compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations in the gaming industry. Any violation of anti-money laundering laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Internal control policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs that we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in prohibiting our employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing our policies and the law. If we or our employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws or our policies governing our operations, we may face investigations, prosecutions and other legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administrative remedies and criminal sanctions. Any such government investigations, prosecutions or other legal\nproceedings or actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFailure to comply with the terms of the Regulatory Agreement could result in a breach and could harm our business.\nWe are currently a party to the Regulatory Agreement with Rhode Island regulatory agencies. The Regulatory Agreement imposes certain affirmative and negative covenants on us. For more detail on the Regulatory Agreement see the section entitled \u201cGovernmental Regulation\u201d in \u201cItem I. Business.\u201d A failure to comply with the provisions in the Regulatory Agreement could subject us to injunctive or monetary relief, payments to the Rhode Island regulatory agencies and ultimately the revocation or suspension of our licenses to operate in Rhode Island. Any such remedy could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Among other things, the Regulatory Agreement prohibits us and our subsidiaries from owning, operating, managing or providing gaming specific goods and services to any gaming facilities in Rhode Island (other than Twin River Casino Hotel and Tiverton Casino Hotel), Massachusetts, Connecticut or New Hampshire, which may adversely affect our growth and market opportunity in those states.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental regulation, which creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern activities that may have adverse environmental effects, such as discharges to air and water, as well as the management and disposal of solid, animal and hazardous wastes and exposure to hazardous materials. These laws and regulations, which are complex and subject to change, include United States Environmental Protection Agency regulations. In addition, our horse racing facility in Colorado is subject to state laws and regulations that address the impacts of manure and wastewater generated by Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (\u201cCAFO\u201d) on water quality, including, but not limited to, storm water discharges. CAFO regulations include permit requirements and water quality discharge standards. Enforcement of CAFO regulations has been receiving increased governmental attention. Compliance with these and other environmental laws can, in some circumstances, require significant capital expenditures. For example, we may incur future costs under existing and new laws and regulations pertaining to storm water and wastewater management at our racetracks. Moreover, violations can result in significant penalties and, in some instances, interruption or cessation of operations.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations that create liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of regulated materials into the environment. Certain of these laws and regulations impose strict, and under certain circumstances joint and several, liability on a current or previous owner or operator of property for the costs of remediating regulated materials on or emanating from our property. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of those substances may be substantial. The presence of, or failure to remediate properly, such materials may adversely affect the ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow funds using such property as collateral. Additionally, as an owner or manager of real property, we could be subject to claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination at or emanating from third party sites. These laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or manager knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants and the liability under those laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of the responsibility. In addition, environmental requirements address the impacts of development on wetlands.\nThe possibility exists that contamination, as yet unknown, may exist on our properties. There can be no assurance that we will not incur expenditures for environmental investigations or remediation in the future.\nWe are or may become involved in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could impact our business and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we are named in lawsuits or other legal proceedings relating to our businesses. In particular, the nature of our business subjects us to the risk of lawsuits filed by customers, past and present employees, shareholders, competitors, business partners and others in the ordinary course of business. As with all legal proceedings, no assurances can be given as to the outcome of these matters. Moreover, legal proceedings can be expensive and time consuming, and we may not be successful in defending or prosecuting these lawsuits, which could result in settlements or damages that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBusiness Operational Risks\nWe have a new business model, which makes it difficult for us to forecast our financial results, creates uncertainty as to how investors will evaluate our prospects, and increases the risk that we will not be successful.\nWe are in the process of expanding our product offering to include sportsbook and iGaming product offerings in 2021. In November 2020, we announced our agreement to acquire Bet.Works Corp, a U.S. based sports betting platform provider, and a long-term strategic partnership with Sinclair Broadcast Group that combines our sports betting technology with their local broadcast television stations and regional sports networks. We also announced our pending acquisition of MKF and SportCaller. These acquisitions represent a new business model and new offerings. Accordingly, it will be difficult for us to forecast our future financial results, and it will be uncertain how our new business model will affect investors\u2019 perceptions and expectations, which can be idiosyncratic and vary widely, with respect to our prospects. It may be difficult for investors to evaluate our business due to the lack of similarly situated competitors. Furthermore, our new business model may not be successful. Consequently, you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of our future financial performance, and our financial results and stock price may be negatively affected.\nOur VLTs and table games hold percentages may fluctuate.\nThe gaming industry is characterized by an element of chance and our casino guests\u2019 winnings depend on a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the element of chance, hold percentages are affected by other factors, including players\u2019 skill and experience, the mix of games played, the financial resources of players, the volume of bets placed and the amount of time played. The variability of our hold percentages has the potential to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success, including win or hold rates, of existing or future sports betting and iGaming products depends on a variety of factors and is not completely controlled by us.\nThe sports betting and iGaming industries are characterized by an element of chance. Accordingly, we employ theoretical win rates to estimate what a certain type of sports bet or iGame, on average, will win or lose in the long run. Net win is impacted by variations in the hold percentage (the ratio of net win to total amount wagered), or actual outcome, on our iGames and sports betting we offer to our users. We use the hold percentage as an indicator of an iGame\u2019s or sports bet\u2019s performance against its expected outcome. Although each iGame or sports bet generally performs within a defined statistical range of outcomes, actual outcomes may vary for any given period. In addition to the element of chance, win rates (hold percentages) may also (depending on the game involved) be affected by the spread of limits and factors that are beyond our control, such as a user\u2019s skill, experience and behavior, the mix of games played, the financial resources of users, the volume of bets placed and the amount of time spent gambling. As a result of the variability in these factors, the actual win rates on our online iGames and sports bets may differ from the theoretical win rates we have estimated and could result in the winnings of our iGame\u2019s or sports bet\u2019s users exceeding those anticipated. The variability of win rates (hold rates) also have the potential to negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur success also depends in part on our ability to anticipate and satisfy user preferences in a timely manner. As we will operate in a dynamic environment characterized by rapidly changing industry and legal standards, our products will be subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. We will need to continually introduce new offerings and identify future product offerings that complement our existing platforms, respond to our users\u2019 needs and improve and enhance our existing platforms to maintain or increase our user engagement and growth of our business. We may not be able to compete effectively unless our product selection keeps up with trends in the digital sports entertainment and gaming industries in which we compete, or trends in new gaming products.\nThe casino, hotel and hospitality industry is capital intensive and we may not be able to finance development, expansion and renovation projects, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOur casino and hotel properties have an ongoing need for renovations and other capital improvements to remain competitive, including room refurbishments, amenity upgrades, and replacement, from time to time, of furniture, fixtures and equipment. We may also need to make capital expenditures to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Construction projects entail significant risks, which can substantially increase costs or delay completion of a project. Such risks include shortages of materials or skilled labor, unforeseen engineering, environmental or geological problems, work stoppages, weather interference and unanticipated cost increases. Most of these factors are beyond our control. In addition, difficulties or delays in obtaining any of the requisite licenses, permits or authorizations from regulatory authorities can increase the cost or delay the completion of an expansion or development. Significant budget overruns or delays with respect to expansion and development projects could adversely affect our business, and our results of operations.\nRenovations and other capital improvements of casino properties in particular require significant capital expenditures. In addition, any such renovations and capital improvements usually generate little or no cash flow until the projects are completed. We may not be able to fund such projects solely from cash provided from operating activities. Consequently, we may have to rely upon the availability of debt or equity capital to fund renovations and capital improvements, and our ability to carry them out will be limited if we cannot obtain satisfactory debt or equity financing, which will depend on, among other things, market conditions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to renovate and maintain gaming and entertainment venues from time to time may put us at a competitive disadvantage to gaming and entertainment venues offering more modern and better maintained facilities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may invest in or acquire other businesses, and our business may suffer if we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our company or otherwise manage the growth associated with multiple acquisitions.\nWe cannot assure you that our recently completed, pending or any future acquisitions, will enhance our financial performance. Our ability to achieve the expected benefits of any acquisitions will depend on, among other things, our ability to effectively translate our strategies into revenue, our ability to retain and assimilate the acquired businesses\u2019 employees, our ability to retain existing customers and suppliers on terms similar to, or better than, those in place with the acquired businesses, our ability to attract new customers, the adequacy of our implementation plans, our ability to maintain our financial and internal controls and systems as we expand our operations, the ability of our management to oversee and operate effectively the combined operations and our ability to achieve desired operating efficiencies and revenue goals. The integration of the businesses that we acquire might also cause us to incur costs that are unforeseen or that exceed our estimates, which would lower our future earnings and would prevent us from realizing the expected benefits of such acquisitions. Our recent acquisition of two properties from Eldorado Resorts will require the provision of transition services from the seller for a period of time as we work to separate the properties from their parent companies. In some cases, the services provided by the sellers are critical to the ongoing efficient operation of the properties and may involve costly payments from us to the provider of the services. If the provision of these services by the sellers is disrupted or given insufficient attention by the sellers, our ability to operate the properties may be negatively impacted until such time as we are able to take full control over the services. Moreover, we must pay the sellers for these services and the costs to us for these services may exceed our estimates and these expenses will negatively impact the results of operations of these properties during these transition periods. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions could result in decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results including, ultimately, a reduction in our stock price.\nWe face risks associated with growth and acquisitions.\nAs part of our business strategy, we regularly evaluate opportunities for growth through development of gaming operations in existing or new markets, through acquiring other gaming entertainment facilities or through redeveloping our existing gaming facilities. In the future, we may also pursue expansion opportunities, including joint ventures or partnerships, in jurisdictions where casino gaming is not currently permitted in order to be prepared to develop projects upon approval of casino gaming.\nAlthough we only intend to engage in acquisitions that, if consummated, will be accretive to us and our shareholders, acquisitions require significant management attention and resources to integrate new properties, businesses and operations. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the acquired businesses with our businesses. The combination of two independent companies is a complex, costly, and time-consuming process. This process may disrupt the business of either or both of the companies and may not result in the full benefits expected. Potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process that may negatively impact our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results include, among other things, the following:\n\u2022the inability to successfully incorporate the assets in a manner that permits us to achieve the full revenue increases, cost reductions and other benefits anticipated to result from any acquisitions;\n\u2022complexities associated with managing the combined business, including difficulty addressing possible differences in cultures and management philosophies and the challenge of integrating complex systems, technology, networks and other assets of each of the companies in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies;\n\u2022the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, each of our ongoing businesses;\n\u2022inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies; and\n\u2022potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses associated with acquisitions.\nAdditionally, even if integration is successful, the overall integration of acquired assets and businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer and other business relationships and diversion of management attention. There is also no guarantee that the acquired assets or businesses will generate any of the projected synergies and earnings growth, and the failure to realize such projected synergies and earnings growth may adversely affect our operating and financial results and derail any growth plans.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to identify, acquire, develop or profitably manage additional companies or operations or successfully integrate such companies or operations into our existing operations without substantial costs, delays or other problems. Additionally, there can be no assurance that we will receive gaming or other necessary licenses or approvals for new projects that we may pursue or that gaming will be approved in jurisdictions where it is not currently approved.\nBallot measures or other voter-approved initiatives to allow gaming in jurisdictions where gaming, or certain types of gaming (such as slots and sports wagering), was not previously permitted could be challenged, and, if such challenges are successful, these ballot measures or initiatives could be invalidated. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that there will not be similar or other challenges to legalized gaming in existing or current markets in which we may operate or have development plans, and successful challenges to legalized gaming could require us to abandon or substantially curtail our operations or development plans in those locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that we will not face similar challenges and difficulties with respect to new development projects or expansion efforts that we may undertake, which could result in significant sunk costs that we may not be able to fully recoup or that otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all. To the extent that we seek to acquire other businesses in exchange for our common stock, fluctuations in our stock price could adversely affect our ability to complete acquisitions.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of existing or pending strategic alliances, joint ventures, acquisitions, divestitures, or new business strategies.\nWe have invested in, formed strategic alliances with, and announced proposed joint ventures with other companies, a proposed joint venture with IGT in Rhode Island (the \u201cJoint Venture\u201d), and we may expand those relationships or enter into similar relationships with additional companies which may require various state approvals which may or may not be granted. These initiatives are typically complex and we may not be able to complete anticipated alliance or joint venture transactions, the anticipated benefits of these transactions may not be realized, or the benefits may be delayed. For example, we may not successfully integrate an alliance or joint venture with our operations, including the implementation of our controls, systems, procedures, and policies, or unforeseen expenses or liabilities may arise that were not discovered during due diligence prior to an investment or entry into a strategic alliance, or a misalignment of interests may develop between us and the other party. Further, to the extent we share ownership, control, or management with another party in a joint venture, our ability to influence the joint venture may be limited, and we may be unable to prevent misconduct or implement our compliance or internal control systems. In addition, implementation of a new business strategy may lead to the disruption of our existing business operations, including distracting management from current operations. Results of operations from new activities may be lower than our existing activities, and, if a strategy is unsuccessful, we may not recoup our investments in that strategy. Failure to successfully and timely realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions or strategies could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWith respect to the proposed Joint Venture, any material unanticipated issues arising from the integration process could negatively impact our stock price, future business and financial results. Moreover, uncertainty about the effect of the proposed transaction on employees, customers, suppliers, distributors and other business partners may have an adverse effect on us and the Joint Venture. These uncertainties may impair our and/or the Joint Venture\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel to execute the Joint Venture\u2019s strategy, and could cause customers, suppliers, distributors and others who deal with us and/or the Joint Venture to seek to change or cancel existing business relationships with us and/or the Joint Venture or fail to renew existing relationships.\nThe Joint Venture will be subject to the risks associated with the Company\u2019s gaming business, approvals by the state of Rhode Island, in addition to the risks associated with IGT\u2019s machine gaming business, and the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Joint Venture may be affected by factors that are different from or in addition to those currently affecting the independent business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company\u2019s gaming business. Many of these factors are outside of our and the Joint Venture\u2019s control, and could materially impact the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Joint Venture. Moreover, although we will have certain consent, board representation and other governance rights with respect to the joint venture, the Company will be a minority owner of the Joint Venture. As a result, we will not have control over the Joint Venture, its management or its policies and we may have business interests, strategies and goals that differ in certain respects from those of IGT or the Joint Venture.\nOur growth will depend, in part, on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties. Overreliance on certain third parties, or our inability to extend existing relationships or agree to new relationships may cause unanticipated costs for us and impact our financial performance in the future.\nWe have entered into strategic partnership with Sinclair Broadcast Group and with the National Hockey League and may enter into relationships with advertisers, casinos and other third parties in order to attract users to our platform. These relationships along with providers of online services, search engines, social media, directories and other websites and e-commerce businesses direct consumers to our platform. In addition, many of the parties with whom we have advertising arrangements provide advertising services to other companies, including other fantasy sports and gaming platforms with whom we compete. While we believe there are other third parties that could drive users to our platform, adding or transitioning to them may disrupt our business and increase our costs. In the event that any of our existing relationships or our future relationships fails to provide services to us in accordance with the terms of our arrangement, or at all, and we are not able to find suitable alternatives, this could impact our ability to attract consumers cost effectively and harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe conduct our business in an industry that is subject to high taxes and may be subject to higher taxes in the future.\nIn gaming jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, with the exception of Rhode Island, state and local governments raise considerable revenues from taxes based on casino revenues and operations. In Rhode Island, the state takes all of the gaming win that comes into our Rhode Island operations and then pays us a percentage of the gaming win. We also pay property taxes, occupancy taxes, sales and use taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and income taxes. Our profitability will depend on generating enough revenues to cover variable expenses, such as payroll and marketing, as well as largely fixed expenses, such as property taxes and interest expense. From time to time, state and local governments have increased gaming taxes and such increases could significantly impact the profitability of our gaming operations.\nOur operations in other states are generally subject to significant revenue-based taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state and local income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. In addition, from time to time, federal, state and local legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. Further, worsening economic conditions could intensify the efforts of Delaware, Colorado and Mississippi and applicable local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes and/or property taxes. It is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws in these jurisdictions or in the administration of such laws. Such changes, if adopted, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The large number of state and local governments with significant current or projected budget deficits makes it more likely that those governments that currently permit gaming will seek to fund such deficits with new or increased gaming taxes and/or property taxes and worsening economic conditions could intensify those efforts. Any material increase, or the adoption of additional taxes or fees, could adversely affect our future financial results.\nThere can be no assurance that governments in jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, or the federal government, will not enact legislation that increases gaming tax rates. General economic pressures have the potential to reduce revenues of state governments from traditional tax sources, which may cause state legislatures or the federal government to be more inclined to increase gaming tax rates.\nIf we fail to detect fraud or theft, including by our users and employees, our reputation may suffer which could harm our brand and reputation and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations and can subject us to investigations and litigation.\nWe have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from various types of financial fraud, including use of stolen or fraudulent credit card data, claims of unauthorized payments by a user and attempted payments by users with insufficient funds. Bad actors use increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities involving personal information, such as unauthorized use of another person\u2019s identity, account information or payment information and unauthorized acquisition or use of credit or debit card details, bank account information and mobile phone numbers and accounts. Under current credit card practices, we may be liable for use of funds on our platform with fraudulent credit card data, even if the associated financial institution approved the credit card transaction.\nActs of fraud may involve various tactics, including collusion. Successful exploitation of our systems could have negative effects on our product offerings, services and user experience and could harm our reputation. Failure to discover such acts or schemes in a timely manner could result in harm to our operations. In addition, negative publicity related to such schemes could have an adverse effect on our reputation, potentially causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In the event of the occurrence of any such issues with our existing platform or product offerings, substantial engineering and marketing resources and management attention, may be diverted from other projects to correct these issues, which may delay other projects and the achievement of our strategic objectives.\nIn addition, any misappropriation of, or access to, users\u2019 or other proprietary information or other breach of our information security could result in legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, or liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws, including for failure to protect personal information or for misusing personal information, which could disrupt our operations, force us to modify our business practices, damage our reputation and expose us to claims from our users, regulators, employees and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nDespite measures we have taken to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent or other malicious activity on our platform, we cannot guarantee that any of our measures will be effective or will scale efficiently with our business. Our failure to adequately detect or prevent fraudulent transactions could harm our reputation or brand, result in litigation or regulatory action and lead to expenses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are largely dependent on the skill and experience of management and key personnel.\nWe expect to experience strong competition in hiring and retaining qualified property and corporate management personnel, including competition from Native American gaming facilities that are not subject to the same taxation regimes as we are and therefore may be willing and able to pay higher rates of compensation. From time to time, a number of vacancies in key corporate and property management positions can be expected. If we are unable to successfully recruit and retain qualified management personnel at our facilities or at the corporate level, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, our officers, directors and key employees are required to file applications with the gaming authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business and are required to be licensed or found suitable by these gaming authorities. If the gaming authorities were to find an officer, director or key employee unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would have to sever all relationships with that person. Furthermore, the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Either result could significantly impair our operations. The time and effort needed to successfully complete the application process could impact our ability to attract, hire and retain top talent.\nWe are subject to risks associated with labor relations, labor costs and labor disruptions.\nWe are subject to the costs and risks generally associated with labor disputes and organizing activities related to unionized labor. From time to time, our operations may be disrupted by strikes, public demonstrations or other coordinated actions and publicity. We may incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs as a result of contractual disputes, negotiations or other labor-related disruptions. We have collective bargaining agreements applicable to approximately 36% of our employees as of December 31, 2019. We have 13 collective bargaining agreements with terms ranging between three to five years generally. These agreements are based solely in Rhode Island. We may also face organizing activities that could result in additional employees becoming unionized. Furthermore, collective bargaining agreements may limit our ability to reduce the size of our workforce during an economic downturn, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOur obligation to fund multi-employer defined benefit to which we are a party may adversely affect us.\nWe must contribute to a number of multi-employer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover certain union-represented employees. The risks of participating in these multi-employer plans are different from single-employer plans in the following aspects:\n\u2022assets contributed to the multi-employer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers;\n\u2022if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers; and\n\u2022if we choose to stop participating in some of our multi-employer plans, we may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.\nIn addition, the funding obligations for our pension plans will be impacted by the performance of the financial markets, particularly the equity markets, and interest rates. Funding obligations are determined by government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date. If the financial markets do not provide the long-term returns that are expected, we could be required to make larger contributions. The equity markets can be very volatile, and in the first quarter of 2020 have displayed meaningful volatility and, therefore, our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time. Similarly, changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements. An adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase our required contributions in the future and adversely impact our liquidity.\nWe may incur impairments to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or long-lived assets.\nWe monitor the recoverability of our long-lived assets, such as buildings, and evaluate their carrying value for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. We annually review goodwill to determine if impairment has occurred. Additionally, interim reviews are performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the long-lived assets or the carrying value and fair value of the reporting unit, in the period the determination is made. The testing of long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment requires us to make estimates that are subject to significant assumptions about our future revenue, profitability, cash flows, fair value of assets and liabilities, weighted average cost of capital, as well as other assumptions. Changes in these estimates, or changes in actual performance compared with these estimates, may affect the fair value of long-lived assets or reporting unit, which may result in an impairment charge.\nWe cannot accurately predict the amount or timing of any impairment of assets. Should the value of long-lived assets or goodwill become impaired, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur operations have historically been subject to seasonal variations and quarterly fluctuations in operating results, and we can expect to experience such variations and fluctuations in the future.\nHistorically, our gaming facilities have typically been subject to seasonal variations. In the Rhode Island market, excessive snowfall during the winter months can make travel to Rhode Island casinos more difficult. This often results in significant declines in traffic on major highways and causes a decline in customer volume. Furthermore, management believes that substantially all visitors to the Rhode Island casinos arrive by some form of ground transportation. Therefore, even normal winter weather may cause revenues and cash flows for our Rhode Island and Delaware operations to be adversely affected. Our recently acquired Black Hawk Casinos are subject to similar risks.\nOur insurance and self-insurance programs may not be adequate to cover future claims.\nAlthough we maintain insurance that we believe is customary and appropriate for our business, we cannot assure you that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all losses and damage to which our business or our assets might be subjected. We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liabilities, including employee healthcare benefits, up to certain stop-loss amounts which limit our exposure above the amounts we have self-insured. We estimate the liabilities and required reserves associated with the risks we retain. Any such estimates and actuarial projection of losses is subject to a considerable degree of variability. A considerable increase in claims as a result of a pandemic including COVID-19, should they occur, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If actual losses incurred are greater than those anticipated, our reserves may be insufficient and additional costs could be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. If we suffer a substantial loss that exceeds our self-insurance reserves, and any excess insurance coverage, the loss and attendant expenses could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations. The lack of adequate insurance for certain types or levels of risk could expose us to significant losses in the event that a catastrophe occurred for which we are uninsured or under insured. Any losses we incur that are not adequately covered by insurance may decrease our future operating income, require us to find replacements or repairs for destroyed property and reduce the funds available for payments of our obligations. We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits, further increase our deductibles, or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by the occurrence of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, or other catastrophic events, including war and terrorism.\nNatural disasters, such as major hurricanes, typhoons, floods, fires and earthquakes, could adversely affect our business and operating results. Hurricanes are common in the areas in which our Mississippi property is located, and the severity of such natural disasters is unpredictable.\nCatastrophic events, such as terrorist attacks in the United States and elsewhere, have had a negative effect on travel and leisure expenditures, including lodging, gaming (in some jurisdictions) and tourism. We cannot accurately predict the extent to which such events may affect us, directly or indirectly, in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or choose to purchase any insurance coverage with respect to occurrences of terrorist acts and any losses that could result from these acts. If there is a prolonged disruption at our facilities due to natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to obtain business interruption coverage for casualties resulting from severe weather such as hurricanes, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain casualty insurance coverage at affordable rates, if at all, for casualties resulting from severe weather.\nCybersecurity and Technology Risks\nWe rely on information technology and other systems and platforms, and any failures, errors, defects or disruptions in our systems or platforms could diminish our brand and reputation, subject us to liability, disrupt our business, affect our ability to scale our technical infrastructure and adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects.\nWe, or one of our state regulatory bodies, engage a number of third parties to provide gaming operating systems for the facilities we own. As a result, we rely on such third parties to provide uninterrupted services in order to run our business efficiently and effectively. In the event one of these third parties experiences a disruption in its ability to provide such services (whether due to technological or financial difficulties or power problems), this may result in a material disruption to the wagering activity at the casinos which we own and have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf our user base and engagement continue to grow, and the amount and types of offerings continue to grow and evolve, we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, to continue to satisfy our users\u2019 needs. Such infrastructure expansion may be complex, and unanticipated delays in completing these projects or availability of components may lead to increased project costs, operational inefficiencies, or interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality of our offerings. In addition, there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation, which may only become evident after we have started to fully use the underlying equipment or software, that could further degrade the user experience or increase our costs. As such, we could fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate increased demands. In addition, our business may be subject to interruptions, delays or failures resulting from adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, power loss, terrorism, cyber-attacks, public health emergencies (such as the coronavirus) or other catastrophic events. Any unscheduled interruption in our technology services is likely to result in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenues due to a shutdown of our gaming operations, cloud computing and lottery systems.\nWe believe that if our users have a negative experience with our offerings, or if our brand or reputation is negatively affected, users may be less inclined to continue or resume utilizing our products or recommend our platform to other potential users. As such, a failure or significant interruption in our service would harm our reputation, business and operating results.\nOur business may be harmed from cyber security incidents and we may be subject to legal claims if there is loss, disclosure or misappropriation of or access to our customers\u2019, business partners\u2019 or our own information or other breaches of information security.\nWe make extensive use of online services and centralized data processing, including through third party service providers. We have experienced cyber-attacks, attempts to breach our systems and other similar incidents. The secure maintenance and transmission of customer information is a critical element of our operations. Our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit customer information, or those of service providers, business partners or employee information may be compromised by a malicious third party penetration of our network security, or that of a third party service provider or business partner, or impacted by intentional or unintentional actions or inactions by our employees, or those of a third party service provider or business partner. As a result, our customers\u2019 information may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without our customers\u2019 consent.\nIn addition, third party service providers and other business partners process and maintain proprietary business information and data related to our employees, customers, suppliers and other business partners. Our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit this information, or those of service providers or business partners, may also be compromised by a malicious third party penetration of our network security or that of a third party service provider or business partner, or impacted by intentional or unintentional actions or inactions by our employees or those of a third party-service provider or business partner. As a result, our business information, customer, supplier and other business partner data may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without consent.\nAny such loss, disclosure or misappropriation of, or access to, customers\u2019 or business partners\u2019 information or other breach of our information security can result in legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, may have a serious impact on our reputation and may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, the loss, disclosure or misappropriation of our business information may adversely affect our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition.\nFinancing Risks\nOur debt agreements and regulatory agreement contain restrictive covenants that may limit our operating flexibility.\nOur current credit facility and regulatory agreement includes, and our future debt agreements and regulatory agreements will likely include, numerous financial and other covenants, imposing financial and operating restrictions on our business. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by general economic conditions, industry conditions and other events beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with these covenants. The failure to comply with a financial covenant or other restrictions contained in the agreements governing such indebtedness or our regulatory agreement, may result in an event of default under the credit agreement or sanctions or fines under the regulatory agreement. An event of default under our credit facility could result in acceleration of some or all of the applicable indebtedness as well as other indebtedness of ours and the inability to borrow additional funds. We do not have, and cannot be certain we would be able to obtain, sufficient funds to repay any such indebtedness if it is accelerated. Restrictions in our debt agreements or our regulatory agreements might affect our ability to operate our business, might limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise and might adversely affect the conduct of our current business, including by restricting our ability to finance future operations and capital needs and limiting our ability to engage in other business activities.\nOur existing and future indebtedness may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $1.13 billion of total indebtedness outstanding consisting of $569.1 million outstanding under our term loan facility (the \u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d or \u201cTerm Loan\u201d) pursuant to the terms of a credit agreement the Company entered into on May 10, 2019 (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with Citizens Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the \u201cAgent\u201d), and the lenders party thereto, and $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 6.75% senior notes due 2027 (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d). As of December 31, 2020, we also were a party to a $250.0 million revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d or \u201cRevolver\u201d and together with the Term Loan, the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d), of which there were no borrowings as of that date. This indebtedness may have important negative consequences for us, including:\n\u2022limiting our ability to satisfy obligations;\n\u2022increasing vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022limiting flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the markets in which we conduct business;\n\u2022increasing vulnerability to, and limiting our ability to react to, changing market conditions, changes in industry and economic downturns;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service, general corporate or other obligations;\n\u2022subjecting us to a number of restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to pay dividends and distributions, make acquisitions and dispositions, borrow additional funds and make capital expenditures and other investments;\n\u2022limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a significant portion of these funds to make principal and/or interest payments on outstanding debt;\n\u2022exposing us to interest rate risk due to the variable interest rate on borrowings under our Credit Facility;\n\u2022causing our failure to comply with the financial and restrictive covenants contained in our current or future indebtedness, which could cause a default under that indebtedness (and other indebtedness of ours) and which, if not cured or waived, could adversely affect us; and\n\u2022affecting our ability to renew gaming and other licenses necessary to conduct our business.\nThough we have significant amounts of indebtedness outstanding, we have the ability to borrow the entire $250.0 million under our Revolving Credit Facility and may issue or incur additional indebtedness to fund our operations, including as necessary to execute on our growth strategy. Further, we may incur other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness. The risks that we face based on our outstanding indebtedness may intensify if we incur additional indebtedness or financing obligations in the future.\nServicing our indebtedness and funding our other obligations requires a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which will be beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and refinance our indebtedness and to fund our operations and capital expenditures depends upon our ability to generate cash flow and secure financing in the future. Our ability to generate future cash flow depends, among other things, upon:\n\u2022our future operating performance;\n\u2022general economic conditions;\n\u2022competition;\n\u2022legislative and regulatory factors affecting our operations and businesses; and\n\u2022our future operating performance.\nSome of these factors will be beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financings will be available to us to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other needs. If our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. The inability to generate cash flow could result in us needing to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, including through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities. If needed, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could adversely affect our financial condition.\nA market downturn may negatively impact our access to financing.\nSince emergence from a recession over ten years ago, the U.S. economy has been expanding at various growth rates. Such growth could slow, or reverse, and another economic downturn could occur, including as a result of the ongoing outbreak of the COVID-19 virus. A downturn in the financial markets or market volatility (like those now being experienced) could negatively impact our ability to access capital and financing (including financing necessary for acquisitions or to refinance our existing indebtedness) on acceptable terms and prices, that we would otherwise need in connection with the operation of our business.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly.\nThere have been and are periods of time when the U.S. securities markets have experienced significant price fluctuations. These price fluctuations may be day-to-day or they may last for extended periods of time. Significant price fluctuations in the securities markets as a whole have caused, and may continue to cause, the market price of our common stock to be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. The trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Additional factors that could cause fluctuations in, or adversely affect, our stock price or trading volume include:\n\u2022general market and economic conditions, including market conditions in the gaming and hotel industries;\n\u2022actual or expected variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022differences between actual operating results and those expected by investors and analysts;\n\u2022sales of our common stock by current shareholders seeking liquidity in the public market;\n\u2022changes in recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022operations and stock performance of competitors;\n\u2022accounting charges, including charges relating to the impairment of goodwill;\n\u2022significant acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or by competitors;\n\u2022sales of our common stock by our directors and officers or significant investors; and\n\u2022recruitment or departure of key personnel.\nThere can be no assurance that the stock price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. In addition, the stock market in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to our performance.\nOur largest shareholder owns a meaningful percentage of our outstanding common stock, which could limit the ability of other shareholders to influence corporate matters.\nOur largest shareholder beneficially owned 36.4% of our outstanding common stock as of February 19, 2021. As a result, this shareholder, who is also our chairman, may be able to exert influence over our affairs and policies. This concentrated ownership could limit the ability of the remaining shareholders to influence corporate matters, and the interests of the large shareholder may not coincide with our interests or the interests of the remaining shareholders. The concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control.\nWe are not paying dividends and any decision to do so in the future will be at the discretion of our Board.\nThe timing, declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our earnings, cash requirements, financial condition, requirements to comply with the covenants under our debt instruments and the Regulatory Agreement, legal considerations, and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. If we do not pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future, then the return on an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon our future stock price. There is no guarantee that our common stock will maintain its value or appreciate in value.\nWe are a holding company and will depend on our subsidiaries for dividends, distributions and other payments.\nWe are structured as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries. Our only significant asset is the capital stock or other equity interests of our operating subsidiaries. As a holding company, we will conduct all of our business through our subsidiaries. Consequently, our principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends, will be dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries. If our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments or distributions to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available, we may not be able to pay dividends. In addition, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors.\nAs a public company we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting and any failure to do so may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe are required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to furnish an annual report by management on, among other things, our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. We also are required to disclose significant changes made in our internal control procedures on a quarterly basis. The process of designing, implementing and testing internal controls over financial reporting is time consuming, costly and complicated. However, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of the exemption permitting us to avoid the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement.\nIf we are unable to successfully remediate any future deficiencies or weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, or if we identify any additional deficiencies or weaknesses, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting could be adversely affected, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition to applicable stock exchange listing requirements, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and/or our stock price may decline as a result.", "PERMNO": 18425, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "TRWH"}
