{"cik": "1374535", "company": "Altra Industrial Motion Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\tRisk Factors\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nWe operate in the highly competitive power transmission and motion control industries and if we are not able to compete successfully our business may be significantly harmed.\nWe operate in highly fragmented and very competitive markets in the power transmission and motion control industries. Some of our competitors have achieved substantially more market penetration in certain of the markets in which we operate, and some of our competitors are larger than us and have greater financial and other resources. With respect to certain of our products, we compete with divisions of our original equipment manufacturer customers. Competition in our business lines is based on a number of considerations, including quality, reliability, pricing, availability, and design and application engineering support. Our customers increasingly demand a broad product range and we must continue to develop our expertise in order to manufacture and market these products successfully. To remain competitive, regular investment in manufacturing, customer service and support, marketing, sales, research and development and intellectual property protection is required. In the future, we may not have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments and may not be able to maintain a competitive position within each of the markets we serve. We may have to adjust the prices of some of our products to stay competitive.\nAdditionally, some of our larger, more sophisticated customers are attempting to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase in order to increase their efficiency. If we are not selected to become one of these preferred providers, we may lose market share in some of the markets in which we compete.\nThere is substantial and continuing pressure on major original equipment manufacturers and larger distributors to reduce costs, including the cost of products purchased from outside suppliers. As a result of cost pressures from customers, our ability to compete depends in part on their ability to generate production cost savings and, in turn, to find reliable, cost effective outside suppliers to source components or manufacture their products. If we are unable to generate sufficient cost savings in the future to offset price reductions, then our gross margin could be materially adversely affected.\nOur growth could suffer if the markets in which we sell our products and services experience cyclicality.\nOur growth will depend in part on the growth of the markets which we serve and on the U.S. and global economies in general. Some of the markets Altra serves are highly cyclical, such as the class eight heavy duty truck, metals, mining and energy markets, including oil, gas and renewable energy. In such an environment, expected cyclical activity or sales may not occur or may be delayed and may result in significant quarter-to-quarter variability in our performance. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in any given period.\nWe must continue to invest in new technologies and manufacturing techniques; however, our ability to develop or adapt to changing technology and manufacturing techniques is uncertain and our failure to do so could place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe successful implementation of our business strategy requires us to invest continuously in new technologies and manufacturing techniques to evolve our existing products and introduce new products to meet our customers\u2019 needs in the industries we serve and want to serve.\nOur products are characterized by performance and specification requirements that mandate a high degree of manufacturing and engineering expertise. We believe that our customers rigorously evaluate their suppliers on the basis of a number of factors, including:\n\u2022product quality and availability;\n\u2022price competitiveness;\n\u2022technical expertise and development capability;\n\u2022reliability and timeliness of delivery;\n\u2022product design capability;\n\u2022manufacturing expertise; and\n\u2022sales support and customer service.\nOur success depends on our ability to invest in new technologies and manufacturing techniques to continue to meet our customers\u2019 changing demands with respect to the above factors. We may not be able to make required capital expenditures and, even if we do so, we may be unsuccessful in addressing technological advances or introducing new products necessary to remain competitive within our markets. Furthermore, our own technological developments may not be able to produce a sustainable competitive advantage. If we fail to invest successfully in improvements to our technology and manufacturing techniques, our business may be materially adversely affected.\nOur operations are subject to international risks including global commercial activities and production facilities, many of which may be located in jurisdictions that are subject to increased risks of disrupted production that could affect our operating results.\nWe operate businesses with manufacturing and other facilities worldwide, many of which are located outside the United States, including in Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, India, Mexico, Peru, Russia, Slovakia, St. Kitts, Sweden, Turkey and the United Kingdom. Our net sales to customers outside North America represented approximately 49% of our total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, we sell products to domestic customers for use in their products sold overseas. We also source a significant portion of our products and materials from overseas. As a result, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, and our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022capital or currency exchange rate controls;\n\u2022tariffs or other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;\n\u2022interest rates;\n\u2022low or negative economic growth rates;\n\u2022unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022changes in foreign intellectual property law;\n\u2022differing labor regulations;\n\u2022natural disaster, labor strike, military activity or war, political unrest, or terrorist activity;\n\u2022pandemic or other public health concerns;\n\u2022requirements relating to withholding taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n\u2022restrictions on our ability to own or operate subsidiaries, make investments or acquire new businesses in various jurisdictions;\n\u2022potential political instability and the actions of foreign governments; and\n\u2022restrictions on our ability to repatriate dividends from our subsidiaries.\nIn addition, our international operations are governed by various U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar laws that prohibit us and our business partners from making improper payments or offers of payment to foreign governments and their officials and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Any alleged or actual violations of these regulations may subject us to government scrutiny, severe criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities.\nAs we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. However, any of these factors could materially adversely affect our international operations and, consequently, our operating results.\nWe rely on distributors and the loss of these distributors could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition to our direct sales force and manufacturer sales representatives, we depend on the services of distributors to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our customers. We support an extensive distribution network, with over 3,000 distributor locations worldwide. During the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 25% of our net sales from operations were generated through distributors. Almost all of the distributors with whom we transact business offer competitive products and services to our customers. In addition, the distribution agreements we have are typically non-exclusive and cancelable by the distributor after a short notice period. The loss of any major distributor or a substantial number of smaller distributors or an increase in the distributors\u2019 sales of our competitors\u2019 products to our customers could materially reduce our sales and profits.\nWe rely on estimated forecasts of our OEM customers\u2019 needs, and inaccuracies in such forecasts could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe generally sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders instead of under long-term purchase commitments. Therefore, we rely on estimated demand forecasts, based upon input from our customers, to determine how much material to purchase and product to manufacture. Because our sales are based on purchase orders, our customers may cancel, delay or otherwise modify their purchase commitments with little or no consequence to them and with little or no notice to us. For these reasons, we generally have limited visibility regarding our customers\u2019 actual product needs. The quantities or timing required by our customers for our products could vary significantly. Whether in response to changes affecting the industry or a customer\u2019s specific business pressures, any cancellation, delay or other modification in our customers\u2019 orders could significantly reduce our revenue, impact our working capital, cause our operating results to fluctuate from period to period and make it more difficult for us to predict our revenue. In the event of a cancellation or reduction of an order, we may not have enough time to reduce operating expenses to minimize the effect of the lost revenue on our business and we may purchase too much inventory and spend more capital than expected, which may materially adversely affect our business.\nFrom time to time, our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses. In addition, during periods of economic difficulty, our customers may not be able to accurately estimate demand forecasts and may scale back orders in an abundance of caution. As a result, existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion. Such cancellations, reductions or inability to fulfill obligations could significantly reduce our revenue, impact our working capital, cause our operating results to fluctuate adversely from period to period and make it more difficult for us to predict our revenue.\nDisruption of our supply chain and COVID-19 related shutdowns of our suppliers\u2019 operations and our operations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability, including manufacturing or distribution capabilities, and that of our suppliers, business partners and contract manufacturers, to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our or their manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics, strikes, repairs or enhancements at our facilities, excessive demand, raw material shortages, semiconductor chip shortages, or other reasons could impair our ability, and that of our suppliers, to manufacture or sell our products. To the extent the current semiconductor chip shortage or other shortages continue, the production of our products may be impacted. If the Company or our suppliers are unable to obtain components from third parties in the quantities and of the quality that we require, on a timely basis and at acceptable prices, we may not be able to deliver our products on a timely or cost-effective basis to our customers. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.\nCOVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 12, 2020. Many countries where we do business, including the United States, many E.U. countries, the United Kingdom, Canada, China, Australia and India, have imposed restrictions on travel and business operations resulting in a substantial reduction of economic activity. Additionally, these restrictions have had and may continue to have a negative effect on the capacity of ports and terminals to process and accommodate commercial activity. The duration of the production and supply chain disruptions, and related financial impact, cannot be estimated at this time. In an effort to contain the spread of the virus and maintain the wellbeing of our employees, and in accordance with governmental requirements, we have experienced temporary closures at certain production facilities, and we have been required to operate some production facilities at reduced capacity. In addition, our suppliers, business partners and customers are also experiencing similar negative impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. Should the production and distribution delays and closures continue for an extended period, of time they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe materials used to produce our products are subject to price fluctuations and our ability to obtain those products and negotiate profitable agreements with our suppliers could increase costs of production and adversely affect our profitability.\nThe materials used to produce our products, especially aluminum, copper and steel, are sourced on a global or regional basis and the prices of those materials are susceptible to price fluctuations due to supply and demand trends, transportation costs, government regulations and tariffs, changes in currency exchange rates, price controls, the economic climate and other unforeseen circumstances. If we are unable to continue to pass a substantial portion of such price increases on to our customers on a timely basis, our future\nprofitability may be materially adversely affected. In addition, passing through these costs to our customers may also limit our ability to increase our prices in the future.\nOur ability to maintain and expand our business depends, in part, on our ability to continue to obtain raw materials and component parts on favorable terms from various suppliers. If we are required to purchase raw materials or component parts subject to agreements that provide less favorable terms, the costs of providing our products may increase, which could decrease our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to work stoppages at our facilities, or our customers may be subjected to work stoppages, which could seriously impact our operations and the profitability of our business.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 9,600 people on a full-time basis, of whom approximately 4,600 were employed in the United States and approximately 5,000 were employed outside of the United States. Of our United States employees, approximately 500 were hourly-rated, unionized employees. Outside the United States, we have government-mandated collective bargaining arrangements and union contracts in certain countries, particularly in Europe where certain of our employees are represented by unions and/or works councils.\nThe Company believes that its relationship with employees is good. However, we are party to several U.S. and international collective bargaining arrangements and union contracts, and we may be unable to renew these agreements on terms that are satisfactory to us, if at all.\t\nIf our unionized workers or those represented by a works council were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown in the future, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations. Such disruption could interfere with our ability to deliver products on a timely basis and could have other negative effects, including decreased productivity and increased labor costs. In addition, if a greater percentage of our work force becomes unionized, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. Moreover, many of our direct and indirect customers have unionized work forces. Strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by these customers or their suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures of assembly plants where our products are used and could cause cancellation of purchase orders with us or otherwise result in reduced revenues from these customers.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, we may continue to experience reduced capacity operations and work stoppages at certain facilities resulting from employee absenteeism due to illness and compliance with quarantine requirements imposed by governmental authorities and Company policy. In addition, customers may experience similar negative impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. Reduced capacity operations, work stoppages and decreased customer operations resulting from these events could impact the Company\u2019s operations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend on the services of key executives, the loss of whom could materially harm our business.\nOur senior executives are important to our success because they are instrumental in setting our strategic direction, operating our business, maintaining and expanding relationships with distributors, identifying, recruiting and training key personnel, identifying expansion opportunities and arranging necessary financing. Losing the services of any of these individuals could adversely affect our business until a suitable replacement could be found. We believe that our senior executives could not easily be replaced with executives of equal experience and capabilities, but we cannot prevent our key executives from terminating their employment with us. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our executives.\nIf we lose certain of our key sales, marketing, skilled machinist, or engineering personnel, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to recruit, retain and motivate highly skilled sales, marketing, skilled machinist and engineering personnel. Competition for these persons in our industry is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit, train or retain qualified personnel in the event scarcity continues or increases. If we fail to recruit and retain the necessary personnel, our business and our ability to obtain new customers, develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer. If certain of these key personnel were to terminate their employment with us, we may experience difficulty replacing them, and our business could be harmed.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights, brands or technology effectively, which could allow competitors to duplicate or replicate our technology and could adversely affect our ability to compete.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as on license, non-disclosure, employee and consultant assignment and other agreements and domain name registrations in order to protect our proprietary technology and rights. Applications for protection of our intellectual property rights may not be allowed, and the rights, if granted, may not be maintained. In addition, third parties may infringe or challenge our intellectual property rights. In some cases, we rely on unpatented proprietary technology. It is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology. Further, in the ordinary course of our operations, we pursue potential claims from time to time relating to the protection of certain products and intellectual property rights, including with respect to some of our more profitable products. Such claims could be time-consuming, expensive and divert resources. If we are unable to\nmaintain the proprietary nature of our technologies or proprietary protection of our brands, our ability to market or be competitive with respect to some or all of our products may be affected, which could reduce our sales and profitability. See \u201cBusiness- Intellectual Property\u201d.\nUnplanned repairs or equipment outages could interrupt production and reduce income or cash flow.\nUnplanned repairs or equipment outages, including those due to natural disasters, could result in the disruption of our manufacturing processes. Any interruption in our manufacturing processes would interrupt our production of products, reduce our income and cash flow and could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur operations are highly dependent on information technology infrastructure, including Enterprise Resource Planning systems, and failures in such infrastructure and failure to comply with data privacy laws or regulations could significantly affect our business.\nWe depend heavily on our information technology, or IT, infrastructure in order to achieve our business objectives both in our everyday business operations and during our integration efforts related to acquisitions. If we experience a problem that impairs this infrastructure, such as a computer virus, ransomware, natural disaster, act of terrorism, cyber-attack, electrical/telecommunications outage, malware, phishing, other intentional disruption, tampering or manipulation of our IT systems by an employee or unauthorized third party, or failure or other problem with the functioning of an important IT application, or if our third party software vendors discontinue further development, integration or long-term software maintenance support for our information systems, the resulting disruptions could impede our ability to record or process orders, manufacture and ship in a timely manner, or otherwise carry on our business in the ordinary course. Any such events could cause us to lose revenue, could harm our relationships with or cause us to lose customers or suppliers, and could require us to incur significant expense to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns. Information security risks also exist with respect to the use of portable electronic devices, such as smartphones and laptops, which are particularly vulnerable to loss and theft.\nCyber-attacks from computer hackers and cyber criminals, social engineering attacks and other malicious Internet-based activity continue to increase generally, and perpetrators of cyber-attacks may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, ransomware, malware, DNS attacks, wireless network attacks, baiting attempts, phishing attempts, spear phishing attempts, distributed denial of service attacks and other malicious software programs that target our IT infrastructure and our networks, and those of our suppliers. These cyber-attacks may expose us to a variety of risks, including a risk of theft of substantial assets, including cash. In addition, a cyber-attack may cause additional costs, such as investigative and remediation costs, the costs of providing our suppliers, customers or other potentially affected parties with notice of the breach, legal fees and the costs of any additional fraud detection activities required by law, a court or a third party.\nTechniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems, to impersonate, or to otherwise seek to perpetrate fraudulent acts against commercial parties change frequently, are increasingly sophisticated and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. We cannot be certain that advances in cyber-capabilities or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting our IT infrastructure and networks or our industrial machinery, software or hardware, and we can make no assurance that we will be able to detect, prevent, timely and adequately address or mitigate the negative effects of cyber-attacks or other security breaches. If such events affect our systems or products, our reputation and brand names could be materially damaged and use of our products may decrease. Additionally, a portion of our workforce is working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may increase these risks. The measures we have taken to maintain adequate cyber security and address these risks and uncertainties may be inadequate.\nWe are also subject to an increasing number of evolving data privacy and security laws and regulations that impose requirements on us and our technology prior to certain transfer, storage, use, processing, or disclosure of data and prior to sale or use of certain technologies. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines, penalties and other costs. For example, the European Union\u2019s implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation in 2018, the European Union\u2019s pending ePrivacy Regulation, the implementation of the ePrivacy Directive by the various European Union member states, and California\u2019s implementation of its Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and Connected Device Privacy Act of 2018, as well as data privacy statutes implemented by other states, or international authorities, could all disrupt our ability to sell products and solutions or use and transfer data because such activities may not be in compliance with applicable law in certain jurisdictions.\nWe are regularly in the process of implementing enhancements to our Enterprise Resource Planning systems and other business systems (collectively referred to as \u201cERP\u201d), with the aim of enabling management to achieve better control across our business operations. If these critical enhancements are delayed, in whole or in part, our current ERP systems may not be sufficient to support our planned operations and certain ERP systems may become obsolete. There can be no assurance that the enhancements to our ERP systems will be successfully implemented and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operations. The occurrence of any of these events or other unanticipated problems with our ERP systems could disrupt the management of, and have a material adverse effect on, our business operations.\nIf any one of these risks materializes, our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nCertain of our businesses are exposed to renewable energy markets which depend significantly on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives.\nCertain of our businesses sell products to customers within the renewable energy market, which among other energy sources includes wind energy and solar energy. This market is inherently cyclical and can be impacted by governmental policy, the comparative cost differential between various forms of energy, and the general macroeconomic climate.\nAt present, the cost of many forms of renewable energy may exceed the cost of conventional power generation in locations around the world. Various governments have used different policy initiatives to encourage or accelerate the development and adoption of renewable energy sources such as wind energy and solar energy. Renewable energy policies are in place in China and the United States. Examples of government sponsored financial incentives include capital cost rebates, feed-in tariffs, tax credits, net metering and other incentives to end-users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of renewable energy products to promote the use of renewable energy and to reduce dependency on other forms of energy. Governments may decide to reduce or eliminate these economic incentives for political, financial or other reasons. Reductions in, or eliminations of, government subsidies and economic incentives could reduce demand for our products and, as our customers attempt to compete on a levelized playing field with other forms of nonrenewable energy, also increase pressure to reduce cost throughout the supply chain. Lower demand or increased pricing pressure could adversely affect our business prospects and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to achieve the efficiencies, savings and other benefits anticipated from our cost reduction, margin improvement and other business optimization initiatives.\nWe have in the past undertaken and expect to continue to undertake various restructuring activities and cost reduction initiatives in an effort to better align our organizational structure and costs with our strategy. We cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve all of the cost savings that we expect to realize from current or future activities and initiatives. Furthermore, in connection with these activities, we may experience a disruption in our ability to perform functions important to our strategy. Unexpected delays, increased costs, challenges with adapting our internal control environment to a new organizational structure, inability to retain and motivate employees or other challenges arising from these initiatives could adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated savings or other intended benefits of these activities and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nFinancial Risks\nAdverse conditions in the credit and capital markets may limit or prevent our and our customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 ability to borrow or raise capital, which could harm our operations and financial performance.\nAdverse conditions in the credit and financial markets could prevent us from obtaining financing, if the need arises. Our ability to invest in our global business and refinance or repay maturing debt obligations could require access to the credit and capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support cash requirements. If we are unable to access the credit and capital markets on commercially reasonable terms, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.\nDeterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies could impair our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations. In addition, a tight credit market may adversely affect the ability of our customers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services as well as impact the ability of our customers to make payments. Similarly, a tight credit market may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy. These conditions would harm our business by adversely affecting our sales, results of operations, profitability, cash flows, financial condition and long-term anticipated growth rate, which could result in potential impairment of certain long-term assets including goodwill.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles comprise a significant portion of our total assets, and if we determine that goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles become impaired in the future, net income in such years may be materially and adversely affected.\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Due to the acquisitions we have completed historically, goodwill comprises a significant portion of our total assets. In addition, indefinite-lived intangibles, primarily tradenames and trademarks, comprise a significant portion of our total assets. We review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles annually for impairment, and any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to the results of operations. Future reviews of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles could result in future reductions. Any reduction in net\nincome resulting from the write down or impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles could adversely affect our financial results. If economic conditions deteriorate we may be required to impair goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles in future periods.\nOur leverage could adversely affect our financial health and make us vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $1,005.0 million outstanding and $395.0 million available under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein). In addition, as of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $400.0 million outstanding under the Notes (as defined herein). Our indebtedness has important consequences; for example, it could:\n\u2022make it more challenging for us to obtain additional financing to fund our business strategy and acquisitions, debt service requirements, capital expenditures and working capital;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to interest rate changes and general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to finance acquisitions and to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other general corporate activities;\n\u2022make it difficult for us to fulfill our obligations under our credit and other debt agreements;\n\u2022require us to dispose of significant assets in order to satisfy our debt service and other obligations if we are not able to satisfy these obligations from cash from operations or other sources;\n\u2022limit our ability to buy back our common stock or pay cash dividends;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our markets; and\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that have less debt.\nSubstantially all of the domestic personal property of Altra and our domestic subsidiaries and certain shares of certain non-domestic subsidiaries have been pledged as collateral against any outstanding borrowings under the Altra Credit Agreement dated November 17, 2021 (as amended from time to time, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d or the \"Altra Credit Agreement\"), governing the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, the Altra Credit Agreement requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests, which may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives.\nOur ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt will depend on a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside our control. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make these payments. If we are unable to meet our expenses and debt obligations, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity, sell assets or issue additional equity. In the future, the then-current economic and credit market conditions may limit our access to additional capital, to the extent that the Altra Credit Agreement would otherwise permit additional financing, or may preclude our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness. There can be no assurance that there will not be a deterioration in the credit markets, a deterioration in the financial condition of our lenders or their ability to fund their commitments or, if necessary, that we will be able to find replacement financing, if need be, on similar or acceptable terms. An inability to access sufficient financing or capital could have an adverse impact on our operations and thus on our operating results and financial position.\nThe Altra Credit Agreement imposes significant operating and financial restrictions, which may prevent us from pursuing our business strategies or favorable business opportunities.\nSubject to a number of important exceptions, under the Altra Credit Agreement we are subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants, such as limitations on:\n\u2022debt and preferred stock;\n\u2022liens;\n\u2022mergers, consolidations, liquidations, dissolutions and asset sales;\n\u2022investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions;\n\u2022speculative swaps and hedging arrangements;\n\u2022dividends or other distributions on capital stock, redemptions and repurchases of capital stock and prepayments, redemptions and repurchases of junior lien secured and subordinated debt;\n\u2022transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022restrictions on liens and other restrictive agreements;\n\u2022amendments of the operative documents related to junior debt agreements and organizational documents; and\n\u2022changes in fiscal year.\nThe restrictions contained in the Altra Credit Agreement may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. A breach of any of these covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under the Altra Credit Agreement. If any such default occurs, the lenders under the Altra Credit\nAgreement may elect to declare all of the outstanding debt under the Altra Credit Agreement, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders under the Altra Credit Agreement also have the right in those circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. In addition, following an event of default under the Altra Credit Agreement, the lenders under the Altra Credit Agreement will have the right to proceed against the collateral that secures the debt. If the debt under the Altra Credit Agreement were to be accelerated, we may not have the ability to refinance that debt, and if we can, the terms of such refinancing may be less favorable than the current financing terms under the Altra Credit Agreement. In the event that the indebtedness is accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full all of our debt.\nThe Credit Agreement contains usual and customary representations and warranties, usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants and restrictions, which among other things, will require the Borrowers to provide certain financial reports to the Lenders, require the Company to maintain certain financial covenants relating to consolidated leverage and interest coverage, and limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other equity distributions, purchase or redeem capital stock or debt, make certain investments, sell assets, engage in certain transactions, and effect a consolidation or merger. There can be no assurance that we will be able to remain in compliance with these covenants. If we fail to comply with either of these covenants in a future period and are not able to obtain waivers from the lenders thereunder, we would need to refinance the Revolving Credit Facility. However, there can be no assurance that such refinancing would be available on terms that would be acceptable to us or at all.\nOur exposure to variable interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and swap counter party credit risk could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business, including the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Some of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates, generally linked to market benchmarks such as LIBOR. Any increase in interest rates would increase our finance expenses relating to our variable rate indebtedness and increase the costs of refinancing our existing indebtedness and issuing new debt. In addition, in July 2017, the U.K.\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, announced its intent to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative: (a) immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar settings; and (b) immediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of the remaining U.S. dollar settings. The United States Federal Reserve has also advised banks to cease entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate. The Alternative Reference Rate Committee, a committee convened by the Federal Reserve that includes major market participants, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities, as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. At this time, it is not possible to predict how markets will respond to SOFR or other alternative reference rates as the transition away from the LIBOR benchmarks is anticipated in coming years. Accordingly, the outcome of these reforms is uncertain, and any changes in the methods by which LIBOR is determined or regulatory activity related to LIBOR\u2019s phaseout could cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or cause LIBOR to cease to exist. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could cause potential increases in interest rates on our floating debt rate. These uncertainties or their resolution also could negatively impact our funding costs, loan and other asset values, asset-liability management strategies and other aspects of our business and financial results. In addition, we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of the countries in which we operate. As we continue expanding our business into markets such as Europe, China, Australia, India and Brazil, we expect that an increasing amount of our revenue and cost of sales will be denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, our reporting currency. As a result, we are subject to currency translation risk, whereby changes in exchange rates between the dollar and the other currencies in which we borrow and do business could result in foreign exchange losses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we rely on interest rate swap contracts and cross-currency swap contracts and hedging arrangements to effectively manage our interest rate and currency risk. Failure to perform under derivatives contracts by one or more of our counterparties could disrupt our hedging operations, particularly if we were entitled to a termination payment under the terms of the contract that we did not receive, if we had to make a termination payment upon default of the counterparty, or if we were unable to reposition the swap with a new counterparty.\nChanges in accounting standards could affect our financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s accounting and financial reporting policies conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), which are periodically revised and/or expanded. The application of accounting principles is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, the Company is required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time to time by various parties, including accounting standard setters and those who interpret the standards, such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such new financial accounting standards may change the financial accounting or reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Implementing changes required by new standards, requirements or laws require interpretation of rules and development of new accounting policies and internal controls that, if not appropriately applied, could result in financial statement errors and, deficiencies in internal control as well as significant costs to implement.\nLegal and Compliance Risks\nChanges to U.S. trade policy, tariff and import/export regulations and foreign government regulations could adversely affect our business, operating results, foreign operations, sourcing and financial condition.\nChanges in U.S. or international social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business, as well as any negative sentiment toward the U.S. as a result of such changes, could adversely affect our business. Changes to tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof, our industry and the global demand for our products, and as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, we cannot predict what changes to trade policy will be made in the future, including whether existing trade policies will be maintained or modified or whether the entry into new bilateral or multilateral trade agreements will occur, nor can we predict the effects that any conceivable changes would have on our business.\nOur businesses are subject to risks generally associated with doing business abroad, including foreign governmental regulation in the countries in which several of our manufacturing sources and facilities are located, such as Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, India, Mexico, Slovakia, St. Kitts, Sweden, Turkey and the United Kingdom (the \u201cU.K.\u201d). We believe that the issue of foreign governmental regulations that would impact our arrangements with our foreign manufacturing sources is of particular concern with regard to countries such as China due to the less mature nature of the Chinese market economy and the historical involvement of the Chinese government in industry. Additionally, we are subject to risks due to uncertainties related to the potential impact of the U.K.\u2019s exit from the E.U. (Brexit) on the Company\u2019s business operations in the U.K. and Europe. If regulations were to render the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impracticable, if our current foreign manufacturing sources were for any other reason to cease doing business with us, or if we were in a position where we needed to relocate our manufacturing facilities due to regulations or other similar circumstances, such a development could have a material adverse effect on our product sales and on our supply, manufacturing, and distribution channels.\nOur business is also subject to risks associated with U.S. and foreign legislation and regulations relating to imports, including quotas, duties, tariffs or taxes, and other charges or restrictions on imports, which could adversely affect our operations and our ability to import products at current or increased levels, and substantially all of our import operations are subject to customs duties on imported products imposed by the governments where our production facilities are located, including raw materials. We cannot predict whether additional U.S. and foreign customs quotas, duties (including antidumping or countervailing duties), tariffs, taxes or other charges or restrictions, requirements as to where raw materials must be purchased, reporting obligations pertaining to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d mined from certain countries, additional workplace regulations, or other restrictions on our imports will be imposed upon the importation of our products in the future or adversely modified, or what effect such actions would have on our costs of operations. For example, our products that are imported to the United States are subject to U.S. customs duties and, in the ordinary course of our business, we may from time to time be subject to claims by the U.S. Customs Service for duties and other charges. Factors that may influence the modification or imposition of these restrictions include the determination by the U.S. Trade Representative that a country has denied adequate intellectual property rights or fair and equitable market access to U.S. firms that rely on intellectual property, trade disputes between the United States and a country that leads to withdrawal of \"most favored nation\" status for that country, and economic and political changes within a country that are viewed unfavorably by the U.S. government. Future quotas, duties, or tariffs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Future trade agreements could also provide our competitors with an advantage over us, or increase our costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nProduct defects, quality issues, inadequate disclosures, misuse and potential product liability claims in relation to the products we manufacture or distribute could result in reputational harm and our having to expend significant time and expense to defend these claims and to pay material damages or settlement amounts.\nDefects in, quality issues with respect to, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to our products or the misuse of our products could lead to lost profits and other economic damage, property damage, personal injury or other liability resulting in third-party claims, criminal liability, significant costs, damage to our reputation and loss of business. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face a business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other adverse effects. We currently have several product liability claims against us with respect to our products. We may not be able to obtain product liability insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, or obtain insurance that will provide adequate coverage against potential claims. Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. An unsuccessful product liability defense could exceed any insurance that we maintain and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or our ability to make payments under our debt obligations when due. In addition, we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed. In the event that our reputation is damaged, we may face difficulty in maintaining our pricing positions with respect to some of our products, which would reduce our sales and profitability.\nWe also risk exposure to product liability claims in connection with products sold by businesses that we acquire. We cannot assure you that third parties that have retained responsibility for product liabilities relating to products manufactured or sold prior to our acquisition of the relevant business, or persons from whom we have acquired a business that are required to indemnify us for certain product liability claims subject to certain caps or limitations on indemnification, will in fact satisfy their obligations to us with respect to liabilities retained by them or their indemnification obligations. If those third parties become unable to or otherwise do not\ncomply with their respective obligations including indemnity obligations, or if certain product liability claims for which we are obligated were not retained by third parties or are not subject to these indemnities, we could become subject to significant liabilities or other adverse consequences. Moreover, even in cases where third parties retain responsibility for product liabilities or are required to indemnify us, significant claims arising from products that we have acquired could have a material adverse effect on our ability to realize the benefits from an acquisition, could result in our reducing the value of goodwill that we have recorded in connection with an acquisition, or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe may be subject to litigation for a variety of claims, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition to product liability claims and securities class action litigation, which has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities, we and our directors and officers may be subject to claims arising from our normal business activities. These may include claims, suits, and proceedings involving stockholder and fiduciary matters, intellectual property, labor and employment, wage and hour, commercial and other matters. The outcome of any litigation, regardless of its merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention and resources, and lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims. Any adverse determination related to litigation or settlement or other resolution of a legal matter could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, harm our reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business.\nChanges in labor or employment laws could increase our costs and may adversely affect our business.\nVarious federal, state and international labor and employment laws govern our relationship with employees and affect operating costs. These laws include minimum wage requirements, overtime, unemployment tax rates, workers\u2019 compensation rates paid, leaves of absence, mandated health and other benefits, and citizenship requirements. Significant additional government-imposed increases or new requirements in these areas could materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flow.\nIn the event our employee-related costs rise significantly, we may have to curtail the number of our employees or shut down certain manufacturing facilities. Any such actions would not only be costly but could also materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to environmental laws that could impose significant costs on us and the failure to comply with such laws could subject us to sanctions and material fines and expenses.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, foreign and provincial environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air or water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the responsibility to investigate and clean up contaminated sites that are or were owned, leased, operated or used by us or our predecessors. Some of these laws and regulations require us to obtain permits, which contain terms and conditions that impose limitations on our ability to emit and discharge hazardous materials into the environment and periodically may be subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities. Fines and penalties may be imposed for non-compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and the failure to have or to comply with the terms and conditions of required permits. From time to time, our operations may not be in full compliance with the terms and conditions of our permits. The operation of manufacturing plants entails risks related to compliance with environmental laws, requirements and permits, and a failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws, regulations, or permits could result in civil or criminal fines, penalties, enforcement actions, third-party claims for property damage and personal injury, requirements to clean up property or to pay for the costs of cleanup, or regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures, including the installation of pollution control equipment or remedial actions. Moreover, if applicable environmental laws and regulations, or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, become more stringent in the future, we could incur capital or operating costs beyond those currently anticipated.\nCertain environmental laws in the United States, such as the federal Superfund law and similar state laws, impose liability for the cost of investigation or remediation of contaminated sites upon the current or, in some cases, the former site owners or operators and upon parties who arranged for the disposal of wastes or transported or sent those wastes to an off-site facility for treatment or disposal, regardless of when the release of hazardous substances occurred or the lawfulness of the activities giving rise to the release. Such liability can be imposed without regard to fault and, under certain circumstances, can be joint and several, resulting in one party being held responsible for the entire obligation. As a practical matter, however, the costs of investigation and remediation generally are allocated among the viable responsible parties on some form of equitable basis. Liability also may include damages to natural resources. In addition, from time to time, we are notified that we are a potentially responsible party and may have liability in connection with off-site disposal facilities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to resolve pending and future matters relating to off-site disposal facilities at all or for nominal sums.\nThere is contamination at some of our current facilities, primarily related to historical operations at those sites, for which we could be liable for the investigation and remediation under certain environmental laws. The potential for contamination also exists at other of our current or former sites, based on historical uses of those sites. Our costs or liability in connection with potential contamination conditions at our facilities cannot be predicted at this time because the potential existence of contamination has not been investigated or not enough is known about the environmental conditions or likely remedial requirements. Currently, with respect to certain of our facilities, other parties with contractual liability are addressing or have plans or obligations to address those contamination conditions that may pose a material risk to human health, safety or the environment. In addition, there may be environmental conditions currently unknown to us relating to our prior, existing or future sites or operations or those of predecessor companies whose liabilities we may have assumed or acquired which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are being indemnified, or expect to be indemnified by third parties, subject to certain caps or limitations on the indemnification, for certain environmental costs and liabilities associated with certain owned or operated sites. We cannot assure you that third parties who indemnify or who are expected to indemnify us for certain environmental costs and liabilities associated with certain owned or operated sites will in fact satisfy their indemnification obligations. If those third parties become unable to, or otherwise do not, comply with their respective indemnity obligations, or if certain contamination or other liability for which we are obligated is not subject to these indemnities, we could become subject to significant liabilities.\nWe or our products could infringe on the intellectual property of others, which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and, if we are not successful, could cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products.\nThird parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us based on their patents or other intellectual property claims, and we may have to pay substantial damages, possibly including treble damages, if it is ultimately determined that our products infringe. We may have to obtain a license to sell our products if it is determined that our products infringe upon another party\u2019s intellectual property. We might be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license, which, if available at all, may require us to pay substantial royalties. Even if infringement claims against us are without merit, defending these types of lawsuits takes significant time, may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns.\nChanges in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could significantly affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nDue to the potential for changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof, the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, the complexity of our intercompany arrangements, uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period, and other factors, our estimates of effective tax rate and income tax assets and liabilities may be incorrect and our financial statements could be adversely affected. The impact of these factors referenced in the first sentence of this paragraph may be substantially different from period to period.\nIn addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. If audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected. Any further significant changes to the tax system in the United States or in other jurisdictions (including changes in the taxation of international income as further described below) could adversely affect our financial statements.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate with market volatility.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. The stock market in general, and the market prices of stocks of industrial companies in particular, have experienced significant price volatility that has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business or operating results. Broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, which in turn could cause impairment of goodwill that could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nIt is not uncommon when the market price of a stock has been volatile for holders of that stock to institute securities class action litigation against the company that issues that stock. If any of our stockholders brought such a lawsuit against us, even if the lawsuit is without merit, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit beyond any insurance coverage which we may have for such risks. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management. Any of these events, as well as other circumstances discussed in these Risk Factors, may cause the market price of our common stock to fall.\nRisks Related to Strategic Transactions\nOur acquisition of businesses and strategic relationships, or our failure to successfully integrate such transactions into our business, could adversely affect our future results and the market price of our common stock.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have made and expect to continue to make, acquisitions. Our continued growth may depend on our ability to identify and acquire companies that complement or enhance our business on acceptable terms. We may not be able to identify or complete future acquisitions. We may not be able to integrate successfully our recent and past acquisitions, including the acquisition of Nook and the Fortive Transaction, or any future acquisitions, operate any acquired companies profitably or realize the potential benefits from these acquisitions.\nThese acquisitions and strategic relationships involve a number of financial, accounting, managerial, operational, legal, compliance and other risks and challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our future results and the market price of our common stock:\n\u2022any acquired business, technology, service or product could under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid for it, or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable;\n\u2022we have in the past, and may in the future incur or assume significant debt in connection with our acquisitions or strategic relationships;\n\u2022acquisitions or strategic relationships could cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community\u2019s expectations in any given period, or over the long-term;\n\u2022pre-closing and post-closing earnings charges could adversely impact operating results in any given period, and the impact may be substantially different from period to period;\n\u2022acquisitions or strategic relationships could create demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are unable to effectively address;\n\u2022we could experience difficulty in integrating personnel, operations and financial and other controls and systems and retaining key employees and customers;\n\u2022we may be unable to achieve cost savings or other synergies anticipated in connection with an acquisition or strategic relationship;\n\u2022we may assume by acquisition or strategic relationship unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the acquired company\u2019s activities. The realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations;\n\u2022in connection with acquisitions, we may enter into post-closing financial arrangements such as purchase price adjustments, earn-out obligations and indemnification obligations, which may have unpredictable financial results;\n\u2022in connection with acquisitions, we have recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet. If we are not able to realize the value of these assets, we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment of these assets; and\n\u2022we may have interests that diverge from those of strategic partners and we may not be able to direct the management and operations of the strategic relationship in the manner we believe is most appropriate, exposing us to additional risk.\nWe continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment, and we cannot be certain that our business, operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected.\nA successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to any purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to retain, reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business, and collect the proceeds from any divestitures. In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other products offered by us. All of these efforts require varying levels of management focus and resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits of any divestiture transaction, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, divestitures of businesses involve a number of risks, including significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships, and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business. Furthermore, divestitures potentially involve significant post-closing separation activities, which could involve the expenditure of material financial resources and significant employee resources. In addition, we may in some cases agree to hold the other party harmless against certain losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, including specified environmental matters and certain income taxes arising prior to the date of acquisition, which also could involve the expenditure of material financial resources. Any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of\nrevenue associated with the divestiture, as well as significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are required to abide by potentially significant restrictions under the Fortive Transaction Tax Matters Agreement which could limit our ability to undertake certain corporate actions (such as the issuance of Altra common stock or the undertaking of a merger or consolidation) that otherwise could be advantageous.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment to Fortive and/or its stockholders of the Distribution and certain related transactions, under the Tax Matters Agreement, we are restricted from taking certain actions that could prevent such transactions from being tax-free. These restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or engage in other transactions, including using Altra common stock to make acquisitions and in connection with equity capital market transactions that might increase the value of our business.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe are subject to tax laws and regulations in many jurisdictions and the inability to successfully defend claims from taxing authorities related to our current or acquired businesses could adversely affect our operating results and financial position.\nWe conduct business in many countries, which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions. Due to the subjectivity of tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. Claims from taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial position. Moreover, changes to tax laws and regulations in the U.S. or other countries where we do business could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.\nGlobal economic changes or continued volatility and disruption in global financial markets could significantly impact our customers and suppliers, weaken the markets we serve and harm our operations and financial performance.\nGlobal economic and financial market conditions have been weak and/or volatile in recent years, and those conditions have adversely affected our business operations and are expected to continue to adversely affect our business. The continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy as a whole will depend on future events. A weakening of current conditions or a future downturn may adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition. Weak, challenging or volatile economic conditions in the end markets, businesses or geographic areas in which we sell our products could reduce demand for products and result in a decrease in sales volume for a prolonged period of time, which would have a negative impact on our future results of operations. The recent surges in COVID-19 cases due to new variants of the virus and the resurgence of inflation brought on by labor and supply shortages may have an adverse impact upon our business. Should these conditions persist for a prolonged period, this could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nNew or more stringent government regulations or standards designed to address climate change could increase our operational costs and severe weather associated with a changing climate could negatively impact our operations and those of our customers and suppliers.\nWe are subject to domestic and foreign regulations and standards governing emissions controls which are, in part, designed to address climate change. Due to increasing global concern over the effects of climate change, new or more stringent regulations and standards may be mandated. In addition, various stakeholders may demand additional controls beyond what is required by such regulations or standards. Tighter emissions controls as a result of these actions could increase our operational costs and could lead to disruptions in our operations as compliance is attained. Severe weather associated with a changing climate could also negatively impact the operation of our facilities, as well as those of our customers and suppliers.", "PERMNO": 91658, "SIC": 3560, "TIC": "AIMC"}
