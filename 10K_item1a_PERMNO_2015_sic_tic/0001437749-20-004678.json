{"cik": "884269", "company": "ALPHA PRO TECH LTD", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nMaking or continuing an investment in common stock issued by the Company involves certain risks that you should carefully consider. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks that may have a material adverse effect on the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties also could adversely affect our business and our results. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or a part of your investment. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors set forth below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.\nGlobal economic conditions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and financial results.\nUnfavorable economic conditions, including the impact of recessions and general economic downturns in the United States and throughout the world, may negatively affect the Company\u2019s business and financial results. These economic conditions could negatively impact (i) demand for our products, (ii) the number and types of products sold, (iii) our ability to collect accounts receivable on a timely basis from certain customers and (iv) the ability of certain suppliers to fill our orders for raw materials or other goods and services. A prolonged recession could result in decreased revenue, margins and earnings.\nThe loss of any large customer or a reduction in orders from any large customer could reduce our net sales and harm our operating results.\nOur operating results could be negatively affected by the loss of revenue from one or more large customers. Our customers are not contractually obligated to purchase any fixed quantities of products, and they may stop placing orders with us at any time. We are subject to the risk of losing large customers or incurring significant reductions in sales to these customers.\nWe rely on suppliers and contractors, and our business could be seriously harmed if these suppliers and contractors are not able to meet our requirements.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers and contractors for the manufacture of our products. If we lose the services of these key suppliers and contractors, or if they are not willing or able to satisfy our requirements, finding substitute suppliers or contractors may be time-consuming and would affect our results of operations in the near term.\nThere are risks associated with international manufacturing that could have a significant effect on our business.\nWe subcontract the manufacturing of some of our goods to Asia and Mexico. These goods are manufactured pursuant to our specifications and quality assurance guidelines. Certain proprietary products are being made in Asia using materials supplied by us.\nWe expect that a significant portion of our product sales will be derived from the sale of products for which we subcontract the manufacturing to Asia, but we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain such subcontracting at current levels. If our ability to subcontract some of our manufacturing to Asia were to decline significantly, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. International manufacturing is subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u25cf\nchanges in foreign government regulations and technical standards;\n\u25cf\ndifficulty of protecting intellectual property;\n\u25cf\nrequirements or preferences of foreign nations for the manufacture of domestic products;\n\u25cf\nthe imposition of duties, border adjustment taxes or tariffs and other barriers to trade;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar; and\n\u25cf\npolitical and economic instability.\nIn particular, if the current novel coronavirus outbreak continues and results in a prolonged period of travel, commercial and other similar restrictions, we could experience global supply disruptions. These restrictions could disrupt our ability to receive manufactured products from China and may disrupt our suppliers located elsewhere who rely on products from China. If we experience supply disruptions, we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly. Any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of supplies even for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter production schedules or suspend production entirely, which could cause a loss of revenues, which would adversely affect our operations\nOur joint venture may present risks that are only present when third parties are involved.\nWe currently participate in a joint venture in India and may in the future enter into joint ventures with other companies or enterprises in international markets, including joint ventures in which we may have a lesser degree of control over the business operations, which may expose us to additional operational, financial, legal or compliance risks. We may be dependent on a joint venture counterparty for product distribution, local market knowledge or other resources. If we are unable to effectively cooperate with joint venture partners, or any joint venture partner fails to meets its obligations under the joint venture arrangement, encounters financial difficulty, or elects to alter, modify or terminate the relationship, we may be unable to achieve our objectives and our results of operations may be negatively impacted thereby.\nOur success depends in part on protection of our intellectual property, and our failure to protect our intellectual propery could adversely affect our competitive advantage, our brand recognition and our business.\nThe success and competitiveness of our products depend in part upon our ability to protect our current and future technology, manufacturing processes and brand names, including Alpha Pro Tech, through a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and unfair competition laws.\nWe enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure of intellectual property agreements with certain of our employees, consultants and vendors and generally control access to and distribution of our proprietary information. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without authorization or to develop similar information independently.\nPolicing unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult. The laws of other countries may afford little or no effective protection of our technology. We cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology or that agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable. In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur industry is highly competitive, which may negatively affect our ability to grow our customer base and generate sales.\nThe markets for our products are intensely competitive. We currently experience competition from numerous companies in each of the markets in which we participate.\nMany of our competitors are more established, benefit from greater market recognition and have substantially greater financial, development, manufacturing and marketing resources than we have.\nIf we do not compete successfully with respect to these or other companies, it could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences.\nDemand for the Company\u2019s products, which impacts revenue and profit margins, is affected by (i) the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii) the Company\u2019s response to downward pricing to stay competitive; (iii) changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases; and (iv) changes in customers\u2019 preferences for our products, including the success of products offered by our competitors and changes in customer designs for our competitors\u2019 products that can affect the demand for the Company\u2019s products.\nThe Company\u2019s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of our new product offerings, including our ability to continually renew our pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market.\nThis ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property protection or gain market acceptance of new products. There are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions to the Company\u2019s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the Company\u2019s operations, compromise information belonging to the Company and our customers and suppliers and expose the Company to liability, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company relies on information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Additionally, the Company collects and stores sensitive data, including proprietary business information. Despite security measures and business continuity plans, the Company\u2019s information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers, breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. While we have not experienced any material losses related to cyber-attacks or information security breaches to date, any such event could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks.\nFrom time to time, the Company is subject to certain legal and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of business and otherwise. The outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the Company\u2019s expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to reliably predict. Various factors or developments could lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, settlement, regulatory development or change in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period.\nOur common stock price is volatile, which could result in substantial losses for individual shareholders.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile, and we expect that it will continue to be volatile. In particular, our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic and business conditions;\n\u25cf\nchanging market conditions in the industries that we serve;\n\u25cf\nmonetary and fiscal policies, laws and regulations and other activities of government agencies and similar organizations;\n\u25cf\nconditions in U.S. and global securities markets and other capital markets;\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf\nfailure to meet analyst predictions and projections;\n\u25cf\ncosts and other effects of legal and administrative proceedings, claims, settlements and judgments;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of innovations or new services by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\ndomestic and international health crises and pandemics;\n\u25cf\nour sales of common stock or other securities in the future; and\n\u25cf\nother events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn addition, our common stock price has recently experienced significant fluctuations due to speculation surrounding the effects of the novel coronavirus outbreak on our operations. Such fluctuations may create conditions in which the market price of our common stock does not reflect an accurate measure of the long-term value of our common stock.\nDue to these factors, you may not be able to sell your stock at or above the price you paid for it, which could result in substantial losses.\nWe invest in a publicly traded entity with a common stock price that is volatile, which could result in substantial losses for the Company.\nThe market price of the entity\u2019s common stock has been volatile, and we expect that it will continue to be volatile as it is a publicly traded stock. In particular, the entity\u2019s common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic and business conditions;\n\u25cf\nchanging market conditions in the industries that it serves;\n\u25cf\nmonetary and fiscal policies, laws and regulations and other activities of government agencies and similar organizations;\n\u25cf\nconditions in U.S. and global securities markets and other capital markets;\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf\nfailure to meet analyst predictions and projections;\n\u25cf\ncosts and other effects of legal and administrative proceedings, claims, settlements and judgments;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of innovations or new services by the entity or its competitors;\n\u25cf\ndomestic and international health crises and pandemics;\n\u25cf\nits sales of common stock or other securities in the future; and\n\u25cf\nother events or factors, many of which are beyond its control.\nDue to these factors, we may not be able to sell the investment in the publicly traded entity at or above the price we paid for it, which could result in substantial losses.", "PERMNO": 87832, "SIC": 3089, "TIC": "APT"}
