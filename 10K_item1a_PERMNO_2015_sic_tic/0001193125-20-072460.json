{"cik": "1260968", "company": "MARLIN BUSINESS SERVICES CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nSet forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission are risks and uncertainties, not limited to the risks set forth below, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report and other periodic statements we make.\nRegulations\nGovernment regulation significantly affects our business. Further changes in regulations that impact our business may have a significant impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe banking industry is heavily regulated, and such regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the federal deposit insurance funds, not shareholders. Since becoming a bank holding company on January 13, 2009, we have been subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and subject to the Bank Holding Company Act. Our bank subsidiary, MBB, is also subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Reserve Board of San Francisco, and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions. Such regulation affects lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth.\nThe financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 resulted in U.S. government and regulatory agencies placing increased focus and scrutiny on the financial services industry, which have subjected financial institutions to additional restrictions, oversight and costs. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act substantially increased regulation of the financial services industry, changed deposit insurance provisions, and impacted the ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices, including in the areas of compensation, interest rates, financial product offerings and disclosures, among other things. New proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in Congress that could further substantially increase regulation of the financial services industry and impose restrictions on the operations and general ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices, including in the areas of compensation, interest rates and financial product\nofferings and disclosures, among other things. Federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. Such proposed changes in laws, regulations and regulatory practices affecting the banking industry or affecting the equipment financing, telemarketing and collecting processes, may limit the manner in which we conduct our business. Such changes may adversely affect us, including our ability to execute our strategies, and originate loans and leases, and may also result in the imposition of additional costs on us.\nWe, like other finance companies, face the risk of litigation, including class action litigation, and regulatory investigations and actions in connection with our business activities. These matters may be difficult to assess or quantify, and their magnitude may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. A substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against us could cause us to suffer significant costs and expenses and could require us to alter our business strategy and the manner in which we operate our business.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve Board. An important function of the Federal Reserve Board is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of bank holding companies in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted.\nFurther increase in the FDIC deposit insurance premium or required reserves may have a significant financial impact on us.\nThe FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured financial institutions up to certain limits and charges insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the deposit insurance fund (DIF). In the event of a bank failure, the FDIC takes control of a failed bank and ensures payment of deposits up to insured limits using the resources of the DIF. The FDIC is required by law to maintain adequate funding of the DIF, and the FDIC may increase premium assessments to maintain such funding.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to increase the DIF\u2019s reserves against future losses, which will necessitate increased deposit insurance premiums that are to be borne primarily by institutions with assets of greater than $10 billion. Future increases in insurance premiums may decrease our earnings and could require us to alter our business strategy and the manner in which we operate our business.\nThe total risk-based capital ratio that MBB is required to maintain is currently set forth in the FDIC Agreement entered into in conjunction with the opening of the bank, as discussed further in -Item 7, Liquidity and Capital Resources-Bank Capital and Regulatory Oversight. We could become subject to more stringent capital requirements, and such requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, could limit our ability to make distributions to shareholders, require the raising of additional capital, require us to significantly change our funding strategies or operations, and could result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe are reliant on debt financing to operate our business. If we cannot issue deposits or obtain other suitable sources of financing, we may be unable to fund our operations. Furthermore, if the cost of debt financing\nincreases, we may not be able to increase the associated pricing of our leases and loans, which could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position\nOur business requires a substantial amount of cash to operate. Our cash requirements will increase as our lease and loan originations increase. We obtain a substantial amount of the cash required for operations through a variety of external funding sources, such as deposits raised by MBB, long-term note securitizations and capital markets activities including sales and syndications of leases and loans. A failure to access the deposits market or to add new funding facilities could affect our ability to fund and originate new leases and loans.\nOur ability to obtain continued access to the deposits market or to obtain a renewal of our lender\u2019s commitment and new funding facilities is affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nconditions in the market for FDIC-insured deposits;\n\u2022\nrestrictions and costs associated with banking industry regulation which could negatively impact MBB;\n\u2022\nconditions in the long-term lending markets; and\n\u2022\nour ability to service the leases and loans.\nWe are and will continue to be dependent upon these funding sources to continue to originate leases and loans and to satisfy our other working capital needs. We may be unable to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all, as a result of prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time, including the presence of covenants or other restrictions under existing financing arrangements. If any or all of our funding sources become unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, we may not have access to the financing necessary to conduct our business, which would limit our ability to fund our operations. In the event we seek to obtain equity financing, our shareholders may experience dilution as a result of the issuance of additional equity securities. This dilution may be significant depending upon the amount of equity securities that we issue and the prices at which we issue such securities.\nWe rely on the sale of finance receivables to third parties in the capital markets as an important source of our liquidity. If such arrangements become unavailable to us, we may be unable to find replacement financing on economically viable terms, if at all.\nOur capital markets sale and syndication activities provide a source of liquidity and have enabled us to manage the size and composition of leases and loans on our balance sheet. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold $310.4 million of assets that generated a net pre-tax gain on sale of $22.2 million. In comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold $139.0 million of assets for pre-tax gain on sale of $8.4 million.\nOur ability to continue to execute syndications is affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to originate assets with characteristics that meet market demand;\n\u2022\nthe interest and ability of counterparties to purchase our contracts, and our ability to maintain relationships with such counterparties;\n\u2022\ncurrent market conditions, including interest rate levels; and\n\u2022\nour ability to negotiate terms acceptable to us.\nIf we fail to originate assets with suitable characteristics to satisfy market requirements, or if our counterparties\u2019 underwriting criteria or interest in acquiring our contracts declines, we may be unable to find replacement funding sources for these assets. Further, any disruption in our ability to access the syndication market could negatively affect our revenues, and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe execution of syndications that are accounted for as sales result in the derecognition of the assets, and the recognition of a gain (or loss) on the sale date, to the extent the proceeds received are in excess of the value of the transferred assets and/or any liability incurred. We may have continuing involvement in the contracts sold to syndication through servicing the contracts sold, and/or through any recourse obligations that may include customary representations and warranties or specific recourse provisions. We generally do not retain credit risk on loans sold, but we are exposed to risk to the extent that we violate such representations and warranties, we may be required to repurchase loans and leases, which could impact our cashflows and ability to fund our operations.\nWe are subject to regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and if we fail to meet these guidelines, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. We may be required to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed.\nUnder regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and other regulatory requirements, we must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators regarding components, risk weightings and other factors. If we fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, if we fail to maintain \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d status under the regulatory framework, if we are deemed to be not well-managed under regulatory exam procedures or if we experience certain regulatory violations, our status as a financial holding company, our related eligibility for a streamlined review process for acquisition proposals and our ability to offer certain financial products may be compromised or impaired.\nWe may require additional capital to fund our operations, driven by changes in required regulatory capital levels, changes in the availability of our funding sources, changes in our business strategies, and changes in market conditions, among other factors. As a result, we may need to suspend or discontinue our share repurchase program or our practice of declaring regular quarterly dividends in order to retain more capital on our Balance sheets. In addition, we may at some point need to raise additional capital to support our operations. Our ability to raise additional capital will depend, in part, on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we may be unable to raise additional capital, if and when needed, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, we may become subject to adverse regulatory actions or restrictions, and limitations on growth of our operations. In addition, if we decide to raise additional equity capital, our shareholders\u2019 interests in us could be diluted.\nFor further information on our required capital levels, see \u201c-Item 1. Business. Supervision and Regulation\u201d and see \u201c-Item 7. Liquidity and Capital Resources. Bank Capital and Regulatory Oversight\u201d-in this Form 10-K.\nIf interest rates change significantly, we may be subject to higher interest costs with respect to our funding sources, which may cause us to suffer material losses.\nBecause we use FDIC insured deposits to fund our leases, our margins could be reduced by an increase in interest rates. Each of our leases is structured so that the sum of all scheduled lease payments will equal the cost of the equipment to us, less the residual, plus a return on the amount of our investment. Generally our leases and loans are fixed-rate in nature. When we originate or acquire leases, we base our pricing in part on the spread we expect to achieve between the yield on each lease and the effective interest rate we expect to pay when we finance the lease. To the extent that a lease is financed with variable-rate funding from deposits or borrowings, increases in interest rates during the term of a lease could narrow or eliminate the spread, or result in a negative spread. A negative spread is an interest cost greater than the yield on the lease. If interest rates increase faster than we are able to adjust the pricing under our new leases or loans, our net interest margin would be reduced. In addition, with respect to our fixed-rate deposits and borrowings, increases in interest rates could have the effect of increasing our costs on future transactions.\nCredit and Portfolio Risk\nIf we inaccurately assess the creditworthiness of our small business customers, we may experience a higher number of lease and loan defaults, which may restrict our access to funding and reduce our earnings.\nWe specialize in leasing and financing equipment and providing working capital to small and mid-sized businesses. Small and mid-sized businesses may be more vulnerable than large businesses to economic downturns, as they typically depend on the management talents and efforts of one person or a small group of persons and often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete. Small and mid-sized business leases and loans, therefore, may entail a greater risk of delinquencies and defaults than leases and loans entered into with larger leasing customers. In addition, there is typically only limited publicly available financial and other information about small and mid-sized businesses and they often do not have audited financial statements. Accordingly, in making credit decisions, our underwriting guidelines rely upon the accuracy of information about these small and mid-sized businesses obtained from the small and mid-sized business owner and/or third-party sources, such as credit reporting agencies. If the information we obtain from small and mid-sized business owners and/or third-party sources is incorrect or fraudulent, our ability to make appropriate credit decisions will be impaired. If we inaccurately assess the creditworthiness of our small business customers, we may experience a higher number of lease and loan defaults and related decreases in our earnings.\nWe rely on information provided by our customers and vendors. If the information that we rely upon is not accurate, or if it was provided with fraudulent or malicious intent, we may not make appropriate credit decisions and our financial position, operating results and reputation may be negatively impacted.\nCustomer and vendor fraud have always been risks inherent to the equipment finance business. We have taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud, including the implementation of new antifraud tools, increased vendor surveillance staff and enhancements to procedures, but these measures need to be continually improved and may not be effective against new and continually evolving forms of fraud. If we experience increases in fraudulent activity, or if our anti-fraud measures are not effective, we could experience an increase in the level of our fraud charge-offs, adversely affecting the results of operations. This could also lead to increased regulatory scrutiny, which could adversely affect our brand and reputation. These impacts, as well as the implementation of any necessary measures to reduce fraud risk could increase our costs and adversely impact our results of operations.\nIf we cannot maintain our relationships with origination partners and our existing customers our ability to generate lease and loan transactions and related revenues may be significantly impeded.\nWe have formed relationships with thousands of origination partners, comprised primarily of independent equipment dealers. We rely on these relationships to generate lease and loan applications and originations. Most of these relationships are not formalized in written agreements, and those that are formalized by written agreements are typically terminable at will. Our typical relationship does not commit the origination partner to provide a minimum number of lease and loan transactions to us nor does it require the origination partner to direct all of its lease and loan transactions to us. The decision by a significant number of our origination partners to refer their leasing transactions to another company could impede our ability to generate lease and loan transactions and related revenues.\nCustomer complaints or negative publicity could result in a decline in our customer growth and our business could suffer.\nOur reputation is important to attract new customers as well as to obtain repeat business from existing customers. There can be no assurance that we will continue to maintain a good relationship with our customers or avoid negative publicity. Any damage to our reputation, whether arising from our conduct of business, negative publicity, regulatory, supervisory or enforcement actions, matters affecting our financial reporting or compliance with Securities and Exchange Commission and NASDAQ listing requirements, security breaches or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to our Operations\nIf we are unable to effectively execute our business strategy, we may suffer material operating losses.\nOur financial position, liquidity and results of operations depend on management\u2019s ability to execute our business strategies. Our objective to transition from a micro-ticket equipment lessor into a nationwide provider of capital solutions to small businesses, includes the following priorities: a focus on strategically expanding our target market; better leveraging our capital and fixed cost base through origination and portfolio growth, improving our operating efficiency, and proactively managing our risk profile.\nExecuting the expansion of our target market and growth of our originations and portfolio depends on a number of factors, include achieving the desired volume of leases and loans of suitable yield and credit quality, effectively managing those leases and loans, obtaining appropriate funding, the competitive environment, and changes to our industry, market and general economic conditions. Accomplishing such a result on a cost-effective basis is largely a function of our marketing capabilities, our management of the leasing process, our credit underwriting guidelines, our ability to provide competent, attentive and efficient servicing to our origination partners and our small business customers, our ability to execute effective credit risk management and collection techniques, our access to financing sources on acceptable terms and our ability to attract and retain high quality employees in all areas of our business. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in our growth and expansion strategies, or that such measures will improve our operating efficiency, or that such measures will improve our operating results, cashflows or financial position.\nTo proactively manage our risk profile, we continually monitor and analyze the performance of our portfolio, assess our delinquency and credit loss experience against our underwriting criteria and determine whether our performance is commensurate with our intended risk tolerance. We may make adjustments in response to such analysis to tighten or loosen our underwriting criteria, or to adjust borrower guarantee requirements, among other measures. Any changes to our risk profile may not have the intended outcome on our portfolio\u2019s performance, and our results of operations, cashflows, and financial position. To the extent that we tighten our standards, we risk not being not competitive in the market and losing origination volume. To the extent that we loosen our standards, we risk incurring credit losses in excess of our expectations.\nAs part of our growth and market expansion strategies, we may evaluate opportunities for business combinations from time to time. We completed the acquisitions of Horizon Keystone Financial in January 2017, and Fleet Financing Resources in September 2018, as part of our strategies to grow through acquisitions that extend our business into new and attractive markets. Any such business combinations entail numerous risks, including risks related to: (i) integrating the acquired operations, services and products; (ii) achieving expected synergies, including infrastructure costs; (iii) acquisition-related costs or amortization cost for acquired intangible assets, that could impact our operating results; (iv) retention of customer and supplier relationships of the acquired business; (v) diverting management attention from our ongoing business; and (vi) potentially negatively impacting our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future investments or acquisitions, and integration of acquisitions may disrupt our business and management. There can be no assurances that any business combinations will have the impact that we intend on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. While we assess the potential benefits that could be realized from any acquisition, as well as the potential costs and operating losses that could be incurred, our assessments and estimates may differ materially from actual costs and benefits realized.\nIf we cannot effectively compete within the equipment leasing industry, we may be unable to increase our revenues or maintain our current levels of operations.\nThe business of small-ticket equipment leasing is highly fragmented and competitive. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. A lower cost of funds could enable a competitor to offer leases and loans with yields that\nare lower than those we use to price our leases and loans, potentially forcing us to decrease our yields or lose origination volume. In addition, certain of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to establish more origination partner and small business customer relationships and increase their market share. The barriers to entry are relatively low with respect to our business and, therefore, new competitors could enter the business of small-ticket equipment leasing at any time. The companies that typically provide financing for large-ticket or middle-market transactions could begin competing with us on small-ticket equipment leases. If this occurs, or we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors, we may be unable to sustain our operations at their current levels or generate revenue growth.\nDeteriorated economic or business conditions may lead to greater than anticipated lease or loan defaults and credit losses and lower origination volumes, which could substantially reduce our operating income and limit our ability to obtain additional financing. Furthermore, natural disasters, widespread disease or pandemics (including the recent coronavirus outbreak), acts of war or terrorism, or other external events could significantly impact our business.\nHistorically, the capital and credit markets have experienced periodic volatility and disruption. In many cases, these markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices of, and credit availability to, certain companies without regard to those companies\u2019 underlying financial strength. Concerns over geopolitical issues and the availability and cost of credit, have contributed to increased volatility for the economy and the capital and credit markets. In the event of extreme and prolonged market events, such as a global credit crisis, we could incur significant losses. Even in the absence of a market downturn, we are exposed to substantial risk of loss due to market volatility.\nOur operating income may be reduced by various economic factors and business conditions, including the level of economic activity in the markets in which we operate. In turn, those economic factors and business conditions can be significantly and negatively impacted by natural disasters, widespread disease or pandemics (including the recent coronavirus outbreak), acts of war or terrorism or other adverse external events, all of which can result in economic slowdowns or recessions. Delinquencies and credit losses generally increase during economic slowdowns or recessions. Because we extend credit primarily to small and mid-sized businesses, many of our customers may be particularly susceptible to economic slowdowns or recessions and may be unable to make scheduled lease or loan payments during these periods. Therefore, to the extent that economic activity or business conditions deteriorate, our delinquencies and credit losses may increase. Unfavorable economic conditions may also make it more difficult for us to maintain both our new lease and loan origination volume and the credit quality of new leases and loans at levels previously attained. Unfavorable economic conditions could also increase our funding costs or operating cost structure or limit our access to funding. Any of these events could reduce our operating income.\nIn addition, natural disasters, widespread disease or pandemics (including the recent coronavirus outbreak), acts of war or terrorism or other adverse external events could have not only a significant economic impact as described above, but also a significant impact on our ability to conduct business as a result of business shutdowns, regional quarantines or otherwise. While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nThe termination or interruption of, or a decrease in volume under, our property insurance program would cause us to experience lower revenues and may result in a significant reduction in our net income.\nOur customers are required to obtain all-risk property insurance for the replacement value of financed equipment. Each customer has the option of either delivering a certificate of insurance listing us as loss payee under a commercial property policy issued by a third-party insurer or satisfying such insurance obligation through our insurance program. Under our program, the customer pays for coverage under a master property insurance policy written by a national third-party insurer (our \u201cprimary insurer\u201d) with whom our captive insurance subsidiary, AssuranceOne, has entered into a 100% reinsurance arrangement. Termination or\ninterruption of our program could occur for a variety of reasons, including: (1) adverse changes in laws or regulations affecting our primary insurer or AssuranceOne; (2) a change in the financial condition or financial strength ratings of our primary insurer or AssuranceOne; (3) negative developments in the loss reserves or future loss experience of AssuranceOne, which render it uneconomical for us to continue the program; (4) termination or expiration of the reinsurance agreement with our primary insurer, coupled with an inability by us to identify quickly and negotiate an acceptable arrangement with a replacement carrier; or (5) competitive factors in the property insurance market. If there is a termination or interruption of this program or if fewer small business customers elected to satisfy their insurance obligations through our program, we would experience lower revenues and our net income may be reduced.\nOur financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates made by our management that could vary from actual results.\nPursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we utilize certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including but not limited to, when accounting for income recognition, the allowance for credit losses, the residual values of leased equipment, deferred initial direct costs and fees, late fee receivables, the fair value of financial instruments, estimated losses from insurance program, and income taxes. If the assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience significant losses as the ultimate realization of value may be materially different than the amounts reflected in our consolidated statement of financial position as of any particular date.\nSpecific to our allowance for credit losses, in connection with our financing activities, we record an allowance to provide for estimated losses based on both qualitative and quantitative factors including, among other things, past collection experience, lease and loan delinquency data, industry data, economic conditions and our assessment of collection risks. Significant management judgment is required to determine the appropriate level of the allowance and, therefore, our determination of this allowance may prove to be inadequate to cover losses in connection with our portfolio of leases and loans. Factors that could lead to the inadequacy of our allowance may include our inability to manage collections effectively, unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or discrete events adversely affecting specific leasing customers, industries or geographic areas. Losses in excess of our allowance for credit losses would cause us to increase our provision for credit losses, reducing or eliminating our operating income. On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted the guidance of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (\u201cCECL\u201d) to measure its allowance for credit losses. This standard substantially replaced the prior measurement that was based on probable, incurred losses. Starting in 2020, the recognized allowance estimate will include expected credit losses over the remaining contractual term of the existing portfolio. After the adoption of this standard, our allowance estimate will continue to involve management\u2019s judgment, and assessment of various qualitative and quantitative factors, and such estimate will still be subject to continual update driven by similar factors outlined above.\nSpecific to our estimates of residual value of equipment, we record sales-type financing leases at the aggregate future minimum lease payments plus the estimated residual value less unearned income. Residual values are established on our balance sheet at lease inception based on our estimate of the expected fair value of the equipment at the end of the lease term. Realization of residual values depends on numerous factors including: the general market conditions at the time of expiration of the lease; the customer\u2019s election to enter into a renewal period; the cost of comparable new equipment; the obsolescence of the leased equipment; any unusual or excessive wear and tear on or damage to the equipment; the effect of any additional or amended government regulations; and the foreclosure by a secured party of our interest in a defaulted lease. Our failure to realize our recorded residual values would reduce the residual value of equipment recorded as assets on our balance sheet and may reduce our operating income.\nFor additional information on the key areas for which assumptions and estimates are used in preparing our financial statements, see \u201cPart II-Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d, and see \u201cNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \u201d in our Financial Statements for further discussion of our accounting policies in this Form 10-K.\nTechnology\nIf we experience significant telecommunications or technology downtime, our operations would be disrupted and our ability to generate operating income could be negatively impacted.\nOur business depends in large part on our telecommunications and information management systems. The temporary or permanent loss of our computer systems, telecommunications equipment or software systems, through casualty or operating malfunction, could disrupt our originations and operations and negatively impact our ability to secure new business and to service our customers. This could lead to significant declines in our operating income.\nA failure in or breach of our technology infrastructure or information protection programs, or those of our outsource service providers, could result in the inadvertent disclosure of the confidential information of our customers and affiliates or confidential personal information of personal guarantors of our loans and leases. Any such failure, including as a result of cyber-attacks against us or our outsource partners, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such information, or a violation of the Company\u2019s privacy and security policies with respect to such information, could adversely affect us.\nOur business model and our reputation as a service provider to our clients are dependent upon our ability to safeguard confidential information. Although we have put in place, and require our outsource service providers to follow, a comprehensive information security program that we monitor and update as needed, security breaches could occur through intentional or unintentional acts by individuals having authorized or unauthorized access to confidential information of our customers, employees or stakeholders which could potentially compromise confidential information processed and stored in or transmitted through our technology infrastructure.\nThe legal, regulatory and contractual environment surrounding information security and privacy is constantly evolving and companies that collect and retain such information are under increasing attack by cyber-criminals around the world. A significant actual or potential theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of customer, stockholder, employee or our data by cybercrime or otherwise, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs, fines, litigation or regulatory action against us. Increasingly, our products and services are accessed through the Internet, and security breaches in connection with the delivery of our services via the Internet may affect us and could be detrimental to our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting the networks that access our products and services.\nRisks Related to our Stock\nOur common stock price is volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially depending on many factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. These fluctuations could cause investors to lose part or all of their investment in our shares of common stock. Those factors that could cause fluctuations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022\nsignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of financial services companies or in the trading volume of our common stock in particular;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our earnings or fluctuations in our operating results or in the expectations of market analysts;\n\u2022\ninvestor perceptions of the equipment leasing industry in general and the Company in particular;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock performance of comparable companies;\n\u2022\nlegislative and regulatory changes with respect to the financial or banking industries;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and trends;\n\u2022\nmajor catastrophic events;\n\u2022\nloss of external funding sources;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our stock or sales by insiders; or\n\u2022\ndepartures of key personnel.\nIt is possible that in some future quarter our operating results may be below the expectations of financial market analysts and investors and, as a result of these and other factors, the price of our common stock may decline.\nWe have historically returned capital to shareholders through normal dividends, special dividends and share repurchases. There can be no assurances that these forms of capital returns are the optimal use of our capital or that they will continue into the future.\nDuring 2019, our Board of Directors authorized an updated share repurchase program. These repurchases reduced our market capitalization and public float, which is the number of shares of our common stock that are owned by non-affiliated stockholders and available for trading in the securities markets, which may reduce the volume of trading in our shares and result in reduced liquidity and volatility in our stock price. The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile which may affect your ability to sell our common stock at an advantageous price. For example, the closing market price of our common stock on the NASDAQ fluctuated between $19.88 per share and $24.84 per share during 2019 and may continue to fluctuate. Market price fluctuations in our common stock may be due to factors both within and outside of our control, including our strategic actions, industry and regulatory matters or other material public announcements, as well as a variety of additional factors including, without limitation, those set forth under these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nIn August 2019, our Board of Directors provided a new authorization for up to $10 million of share repurchases, and as of December 31, 2019, we have $8.9 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. We have no obligation to repurchase shares under this authorization, and any share repurchase program may be extended, modified, suspended or discontinued at any time.\nAny repurchases would utilize cash that we will not be able to use in other ways, or to meet other potential demands, and may not prove to be the best use of our capital. There can be no assurance that we will repurchase any, or the full amount authorized under any share repurchase program, or that any past or future repurchases will have a positive impact on our stock price.\nFuture sales of our Common Stock by our significant shareholders may depress our stock price or impair our ability to raise funds in new share offerings. Our existing shareholders may be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval and over our management.\nA small number of shareholders own a substantial amount of our Common Stock. As of December 31, 2019, our top 5 largest shareholders beneficially own 54% of our common stock. The market price of our common stock could be adversely affected as a result of sales of a large number of our common stock shares in the market,\nor the perception that these sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales might occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive.\nThese shareholders, if acting together, would be in a position to significantly influence the election of our directors and the vote on certain corporate transactions, including mergers and other business combinations. This concentrated ownership could limit other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters. This may result in our taking corporate actions that other shareholders may not consider to be in their best interest and may affect the price of our Common Stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions and our right to issue preferred stock could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult.\nWe are a Pennsylvania corporation. Anti-takeover provisions of Pennsylvania law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if such change in control would be beneficial to our shareholders. Our amended and restated articles of incorporation and our bylaws contain certain other provisions that would make it difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, including a provision that our Board of Directors may issue preferred stock without shareholder approval.", "PERMNO": 89913, "SIC": 6172, "TIC": "MRLN"}
