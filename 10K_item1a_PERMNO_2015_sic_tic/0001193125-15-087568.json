{"cik": "1275014", "company": "Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-11", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nThe cyclical and highly volatile nature of the industries we serve could harm our operating results.\nOur business and operating results depend in significant part upon capital expenditures by manufacturers in the semiconductor capital equipment, consumer, medical, energy, industrial, flat panel and research industries, which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for such products. Historically, the industries we serve (in particular the semiconductor industry) have been highly cyclical, with recurring periods of over-supply of products that have had a severe negative effect on the demand for capital equipment used to manufacture such products. We have experienced and anticipate that we will continue to experience significant fluctuations in customer orders for our products through such cycles. Slowdowns in the industries we serve have had, and future slowdowns may also have, a material adverse effect on our operating results. During periods of decreasing demand for our products, we must be able to appropriately align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions, effectively manage our supply chain and motivate and retain employees. During periods of increased demand, we must increase manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demands, effectively manage our supply chain and attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of employees. If the industries we serve experience downturns, or if we are not able to timely and appropriately adapt to the changes in our business environment, our results of operations will be harmed. Also, the cyclical and volatile nature of the industries we serve make future revenues, results of operations and net cash flows difficult to estimate.\nWe rely on a small number of original equipment manufacturing customers for a significant portion of our sales, and any adverse change in our relationships with these customers, including a decision by such customers not to continue to outsource critical subsystems or to give market share to one of our competitors, would adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition. Our customers also exert a significant amount of negotiating leverage over us, which may require us to accept lower operating margins, increased liability risk or changes in our operations in order to retain or expand our market share with them.\nA relatively small number of OEM customers have historically accounted for a significant portion of our sales, and we expect this trend to continue. As a group, the respective year\u2019s top three customers accounted for 76%, 81% and 80% of our sales for fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and we expect that our sales will continue to be concentrated among a small number of customers. In addition, our customer contracts generally do not require customers to place any orders. Accordingly, the success of our business depends on OEMs continuing to outsource the manufacturing of critical subsystems to us. Because of the small number of OEMs in the markets we serve, most of which are already our customers, it would be difficult to replace lost revenue resulting from the loss of, or the reduction, cancellation or delay in purchase orders by, any one of these customers, whether due to their decision to not continue to outsource all or a portion of their critical subsystems for their capital equipment, their giving market share to our competitors or for other reasons, such as customer\u2019s bankruptcy or insolvency or decreased demand for such customer\u2019s products. We have in the past lost business from customers who have taken the manufacturing of our products in-house or given market share to our competitors. For example, we terminated our manufacturing services to FEI at the beginning of our second quarter of fiscal 2012. In addition, we announced in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 that one of our larger semiconductor equipment customers has decided to in-source a portion of their gas panel business and in February 2015 UCT came to an agreement with ISI to transition to insourced manufacturing for their next generation robot. UCT will continue to manufacture previous ISI\u2019s generation robots and also assist with machined components and spare parts for current and future ISI production. Further, since our customers generally own the designs and other intellectual property to the products we manufacture, we cannot prevent them from licensing such designs and other intellectual property to our competitors for the manufacture of such products. If we are unable to replace revenue from customers who determine to take subsystem assembly in-house or give market share to our competitors, such events could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operation.\nIn addition, consolidation among our customers, or a decision by any one or more of our customers to outsource all or most manufacturing and assembly work to a single equipment manufacturer, may further concentrate our business in a limited number of customers and expose us to increased risks relating to dependence on an even smaller number of customers. For example, one of our former largest customers, Novellus Systems, Inc., was acquired by another one of our largest customers, Lam Research Corporation, in June 2012.\nIn addition, by virtue of our largest customers\u2019 size and the significant portion of revenue that we derive from them, as well as the competitive landscape, our customers are able to exert significant influence and pricing pressure in the negotiation of our commercial agreements and individual purchase orders and on the conduct of our business with them. Our customers often require reduced prices or other pricing, quality or delivery commitments as a condition to their awarding of market share to us or the placement of orders with us in any given period, which may, among other things, result in reduced operating margins in order to maintain or expand our market share. Our customers\u2019 negotiating leverage also can result in customer agreements or terms and conditions that may contain significant liability risk to us. For example, some of our customers insist that we provide them indemnification against certain liabilities in our agreements with them, including claims of losses by their customers caused by our products, which may be uncapped. In some cases, we have determined to self-insure against liability risk in our customer agreements, meaning that we may be directly responsible for high magnitude liability claims by our customers without recourse to insurance proceeds from third-party insurers. Our customers may also pressure us to make other concessions in order to preserve or expand our market share with them, which may harm our business. For example, one or more of our customers may require us to move the manufacture of our products from lower-cost geographies or locations such as China to higher-cost geographies or locations that are closer to such customer\u2019s facilities, such as Singapore, which could result in reduced margins and a sub-optimal cost structure . If we are unable to retain and expand our business with our customers on favorable terms, or at all, our business and operating results will be adversely affected, or we may be susceptible to increased liability risk which, if realized, may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, results of operation and financial condition.\nWe have also had to qualify, and are required to maintain our status, as a supplier for each of our customers. This is often a lengthy process that involves the inspection and approval by a customer of our engineering, documentation, manufacturing and quality control procedures before that customer will place volume orders. Our ability to lessen the adverse effect of any loss of, or reduction in sales to, an existing customer through the rapid addition of one or more new customers is limited because of these qualification requirements. Consequently, the risk that our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected by the loss of, or any reduction in orders by, any of our significant customers is increased. Moreover, if we lost our existing status as a qualified supplier to any of our customers, such customer could cancel its orders from us or otherwise terminate its relationship with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with weakness in the global economy.\nWe rely to a significant extent on OEM customers, whose business, in turn, depends largely on consumer spending and capital expenditures by businesses. Continuing uncertainty regarding the global economy continue to pose challenges to our business. Economic uncertainty and related factors, including current unemployment levels, uncertainty in European debt markets, fiscal uncertainty in the U.S. economy, market volatility and the slow rate of recovery of many countries from recent recessions, exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain of our customers to push out, cancel, or refrain from placing orders for products or services, which may reduce sales and materially affect our results of operation and financial condition. Difficulties in obtaining capital, uncertain market conditions, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, leading to customers\u2019 reduced research and development funding and/or capital expenditures and, in turn, lower orders from our customers and/or additional slow moving or obsolete inventory or bad debt expense for us. These conditions may also similarly affect key suppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for our products or require us to either procure products from high-cost suppliers, or if no additional suppliers exist, to reconfigure the design and manufacture of our products, and we may be unable to fulfill some customer orders. For example, on October 6, 2014, one of our new customers GT Advanced Technologies (GTAT), filed for bankruptcy under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Hampshire which impaired the collectability of our outstanding accounts receivable as well as the value of our on-hand inventory related to GTAT and also resulted in a charge for non-cancelable vendor commitments.\nWe have significant existing indebtedness; the restrictive covenants under our credit agreement or other limitations on financing may limit our ability to expand or pursue our business strategy or make capital expenditures; if we are forced to pay some or all of our indebtedness prior to its maturity, our financial position could be severely and adversely affected.\nWe have significant outstanding indebtedness. On July 3, 2012, we refinanced our prior credit facility and entered into our credit agreement as of December 26, 2014 with Silicon Valley Bank, U.S. Bank National Association and HSBC Bank. The current credit agreement provides for a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $40.0 million and a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $40.0 million. On July 3, 2012, we borrowed $40.0 million under the term loan and $39.8 million under the revolving credit facility to finance our acquisition of AIT and repay Silicon Valley Bank as lender under our prior credit facility. As of December 26, 2014, the long-term portion of our outstanding indebtedness, net of debt issuance costs, under our credit facility was $38.6 million, and the short-term portion was $9.5 million.\nOn February 2, 2015, we entered into a new credit agreement by and among us, certain of our subsidiaries, East West Bank and Citi National Bank. This credit agreement provides for a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $40.0 million and a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $40.0 million, a letter of credit facility in the aggregate availability amount of $20.0 million and a swingline sub-facility in the aggregate availability amount of $5.0 million. On February 2, 2015, we borrowed an aggregate of $46.5 million\nunder this new credit agreement from East West Bank and Citi National Bank to repay the remaining outstanding balance from the loan obtained from Silicon Valley Bank, U.S. Bank National Association and HSBC Bank. On February 5, 2015, we borrowed an additional $29.7 million under this new credit agreement from East West Bank and Citi National Bank to finance the acquisition of Marchi.\nOur new credit agreement contains certain covenants that restrict our ability to take certain actions, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt, including guarantees, or create liens;\n\u2022\npay dividends and make distributions in respect of our capital stock;\n\u2022\nrepurchase capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments or other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with stockholders and affiliates;\n\u2022\nsell or otherwise dispose of assets;\n\u2022\nmake payments on subordinated indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nengage in certain mergers and acquisitions, new lines of business or make other fundamental changes.\nThe restrictive covenants in our credit agreement may therefore limit our strategic and financing options and our ability to return capital to our stockholders through dividends or stock buybacks.\nOur new credit agreement also requires us to maintain certain financial and other covenants. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with such financial or other covenants. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness, which would materially adversely affect our financial health if we are unable to access sufficient funds to repay all the outstanding amounts. Moreover, if we are unable to meet our debt obligations as they come due, we could be forced to restructure or refinance such obligations, seek additional equity financing or sell assets, which we may not be able to do on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nIn addition, the credit agreement has certain mandatory prepayment provisions, including annual prepayments of excess cash flow above certain thresholds. As long as our indebtedness remains outstanding, the restrictive covenants and mandatory prepayment provisions could impair our ability to expand or pursue our business strategies or obtain additional funding.\nOur dependence on our suppliers may prevent us from delivering an acceptable product on a timely basis.\nWe rely on both single-source and sole-source suppliers, some of whom are relatively small, for many of the components we use in our products. In addition, our customers often specify components of particular suppliers that we must incorporate into our products. Our suppliers are under no obligation to provide us with components. As a result, the loss of or failure to perform by any of these suppliers could adversely affect our business and operating results. In addition, the manufacturing of certain components and subsystems is a complex process. Therefore, if a supplier were unable to provide the volume of components we require on a timely basis and at acceptable prices and quality, we would have to identify and qualify replacements from alternative sources. However, the process of qualifying new suppliers for complex components is also lengthy and could delay our production, which would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may also experience difficulty in obtaining sufficient supplies of components and raw materials in times of significant growth in our business. For example, we have in the past experienced shortages in supplies of various components, such as mass flow controllers, valves and regulators, and certain prefabricated parts, such as sheet metal enclosures, used in the manufacture of our products. In addition, one of our competitors\nmanufactures mass flow controllers that may be specified by one or more of our customers. If we are unable to obtain these particular mass flow controllers from our competitor or convince a customer to select alternative mass flow controllers, we may be unable to meet that customer\u2019s requirements, which could result in a loss of market share.\nIf we, or our suppliers, are unable to procure sufficient quantities of components or raw materials from suppliers, it could influence decisions by our customers to delay or cancel orders and decisions by our vendors to fulfill our purchase orders and, consequently, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to respond quickly enough to changes in demand for our products.\nDemand shifts in the industries we serve are rapid and difficult to predict, and we may not be able to anticipate or respond quickly enough to changes in demand. Our ability to increase sales of our products in periods of increasing demand depends, in part, upon our ability to:\n\u2022\nmobilize our supply chain in order to maintain component and raw material supply;\n\u2022\noptimize the use of our design, engineering and manufacturing capacity in a timely manner;\n\u2022\ndeliver our products to our customers in a timely fashion;\n\u2022\nexpand, if necessary, our manufacturing capacity; and\n\u2022\nmaintain our product quality as we increase production.\nIf we are unable to respond to rapid increases in demand for our products on a timely basis or to manage any corresponding expansion of our manufacturing capacity effectively, our customers could increase their purchases from our competitors, which would adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to remain profitable and mitigate the impact on our business in periods of decreasing demand depends, in part, upon our ability to:\n\u2022\noptimize our inventory levels and reduce or cancel orders to our suppliers without compromising our relationships with such suppliers;\n\u2022\nreduce our variable costs through a reduction of our manufacturing workforce;\n\u2022\ncontinue to motivate our employees; and\n\u2022\nmaintain the prices, quality and delivery cycles of our products in order to retain our customers\u2019 business.\nWe may not be able to fund our future capital requirements or strategic acquisitions from our operations, and financing from other sources may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nWe made capital expenditures of approximately $5.5 million in fiscal 2014 and $3.0 million in fiscal 2013 related to our manufacturing facilities in the United States, China and Singapore. In February 2015, we paid approximately $30.0 million and issued 1,437,500 shares of our common stock in connection with our acquisition of Marchi. The cash portion of the merger consideration was financed through the new credit facility described above; of which an aggregate of $76.2 million was outstanding as of February 28, 2015. The amount of our future capital requirements or strategic acquisitions will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe cost required to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity;\n\u2022\nthe timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts;\n\u2022\nthe timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products;\n\u2022\nthe cost required to complete AIT and Marchi\u2019s enterprise resource planning implementation and to migrate AIT and its subsidiaries and Marchi to our enterprise resource planning system;\n\u2022\nchanging manufacturing capabilities to meet new customer requirements;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our products; and\n\u2022\nour ability to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities and successfully negotiate the terms of such acquisitions.\nWe had $79.0 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 26, 2014 of which $57.9 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. On February 5, 2015, after consummation of our acquisition of Marchi, the refinancing of our existing credit facility and payment of transaction expenses, we had $77.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and no amounts available under our new revolving credit facility for future borrowings. If the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries is needed for our operations or to fund capital expenditures or other strategic acquisitions in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds.\nGiven our significant existing leverage, limited availability under our new revolving line of credit and the potential tax effects of repatriating foreign cash or other factors, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing if our current domestic cash and cash flow from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities. We may not be able to obtain additional debt financing when and if necessary in a timely manner. Access to capital markets has, in the past, been unavailable to companies such as ours and there can be no assurance that we would be able to complete an equity or other financing with terms satisfactory to us or at all. In addition, equity financings could be dilutive to holders of our common stock, and debt financings would likely involve additional covenants that restrict our business operations. Any potential strategic acquisition or significant capital expenditure may also require the consent of our existing lenders. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, if and when needed, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products, take advantage of future opportunities, including potential acquisitions, grow our business or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur quarterly revenue and operating results fluctuate significantly from period to period, and this may cause volatility in our common stock price.\nOur quarterly revenue and operating results, including our gross margin, have fluctuated significantly in the past, and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future for a variety of reasons which may include:\n\u2022\ndemand for and market acceptance of our products as a result of the cyclical nature of the industries we serve or otherwise, often resulting in reduced sales during industry downturns and increased sales during periods of industry recovery or growth;\n\u2022\noverall economic conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in the timing and size of orders by our customers;\n\u2022\nloss of business from one or more significant customers due to strategic decisions by our customers to terminate their outsourcing relationship with us or give market share to our competitors, or due to decreased demand for our customers\u2019 products by end customers;\n\u2022\nstrategic consolidation by our customers;\n\u2022\ncancellations and postponements of previously placed orders;\n\u2022\npricing pressure from either our competitors or our customers, resulting in the reduction of our product prices, margins or loss of market share;\n\u2022\ndisruptions or delays in the manufacturing of our products or in the supply of components or raw materials that are incorporated into or used to manufacture our products, thereby causing us to delay the shipment of products;\n\u2022\ndecreased margins for several or more quarters following the introduction of new products, especially as we introduce new subsystems;\n\u2022\ndelays in ramp-up in production, low yields or other problems experienced at our manufacturing facilities in China;\n\u2022\nchanges in design-to-delivery cycle times;\n\u2022\ninability to reduce our costs quickly in step with reductions in our prices or in response to decreased demand for our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in our mix of products sold;\n\u2022\nwrite-offs of excess or obsolete inventory due to a customer\u2019s bankruptcy or insolvency;\n\u2022\none-time expenses or charges associated with failed acquisition negotiations or completed acquisitions;\n\u2022\ninability to control our operating costs consistent with target levels;\n\u2022\nannouncements by our competitors of new products, services or technological innovations, which may, among other things, render our products less competitive; and\n\u2022\ngeographic mix of customer orders or worldwide earnings.\nAs a result of the foregoing, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance. Changes in the timing or terms of a small number of transactions could disproportionately affect our operating results in any particular quarter. Moreover, our operating results in one or more future quarters may fail to meet our guidance or the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If this occurs, we would expect to experience an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nWe have established, and as markets will allow, intend to expand our operations in Asia, which exposes us to risks associated with operating in a foreign country.\nWe generated approximately 29.6% and 28.5% of our sales in international markets for fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. Depending on market conditions, we intend to expand our operations in Asia, principally in China and Singapore. In addition, through our acquisition of AIT, we acquired a manufacturing facility in Cebu, Philippines. The carrying amount of our fixed assets in Asia was $5.8 million as of December 26, 2014.\nWe are exposed to political, economic, legal and other risks associated with operating in Asia, including:\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange fluctuations;\n\u2022\npolitical, civil and economic instability;\n\u2022\ntariffs and other barriers;\n\u2022\ntiming and availability of export licenses;\n\u2022\ndisruptions to our and our customers\u2019 operations due to increased risk of outbreak of diseases, such as SARS and avian flu;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in operations due to China\u2019s developing domestic infrastructure, including transportation and energy;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in developing relationships with local suppliers;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in attracting new international customers;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in accounts receivable collections;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing distant international subsidiary and branch operations;\n\u2022\nthe burden of complying with foreign and international laws and treaties;\n\u2022\nlegal systems potentially subject to undue influence or corruption;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in transferring funds to other geographic locations; and\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings to the United States.\nIn addition, due to generally lower labor and materials costs in the Asian markets in which we currently operate, a shift in the mix of orders from our customers away from such Asian markets could adversely affect our operating margins.\nOur operations in Asia are also subject us to U.S. laws governing the export of equipment. These laws are complex and require us to obtain clearances for the export to Asia of certain equipment. We may fail to comply with these laws and regulations, which could require us to cease the export of certain equipment and expose us to fines or penalties.\nOver the past several years, the Chinese government has pursued economic reform policies, including the encouragement of private economic activity and greater economic decentralization. The Chinese government may not continue these policies or may significantly alter them to our detriment from time to time without notice. Changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation, the imposition of confiscatory taxation policies, new restrictions on currency conversion or limitations on sources of supply could materially and adversely affect our Chinese operations, which could result in the partial or total loss of our investment in that country and materially and adversely affect our future operating results.\nWe are subject to order and shipment uncertainties and any significant reductions, cancellations or delays in customer orders could cause our revenue to decline and our operating results to suffer.\nOur revenue is difficult to forecast because we generally do not have a material backlog of unfilled orders and because of the short time frame within which we are often required to design, produce and deliver products to our customers. Most of our revenue in any quarter depends on customer orders for our products that we receive and fulfill in the same quarter. We do not have long-term purchase orders or contracts that contain minimum purchase commitments from our customers. Instead, we receive non-binding forecasts of the future volume of orders from our customers. Occasionally, we order and build component inventory in advance of the receipt of actual customer orders. Customers may cancel order forecasts, change production quantities from forecasted volumes or delay production for reasons beyond our control. Furthermore, reductions, cancellations or delays in customer order forecasts, which may occur for various reasons, including reduced demand for our customer\u2019s products, customer bankruptcies or customer insolvency, usually occur without penalty to, or compensation from, the customer. Reductions, cancellations or delays in forecasted orders could cause us to hold inventory longer than anticipated, which could reduce our gross profit, restrict our ability to fund our operations and cause us to incur unanticipated reductions or delays in revenue. Moreover, most of the products we manufacture are custom built for our customers and are therefore not fungible with products we sell to other customers. If we do not obtain orders as we anticipate, we could have excess component inventory for a specific product that we would not be able to sell to another customer, likely resulting in inventory write-offs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, because many of our costs are fixed in the short term, we could experience deterioration in our gross profit and operating margins when our production volumes decline.\nThe manufacturing of our products is highly complex, and if we are not able to manage our manufacturing and procurement process effectively, our business and operating results will suffer.\nThe manufacturing of our products is a highly complex process that involves the integration of multiple components and requires effective management of our supply chain while meeting our customers\u2019 design-to-delivery cycle time requirements. Through the course of the manufacturing process, our customers may modify design and system configurations in response to changes in their own customers\u2019 requirements. In order to rapidly respond to these modifications and deliver our products to our customers in a timely manner, we must effectively manage our manufacturing and procurement process. If we fail to manage this process effectively, we risk losing customers and damaging our reputation. We may also be subject to liability under our agreements with our customers if we or our suppliers fail to re-configure manufacturing processes or components in response to these modifications, which may lead to product defect claims by our customers. In addition, if we acquire inventory in excess of demand or that does not meet customer specifications, we could incur excess or obsolete inventory charges. These risks are even greater during the current extended period of macroeconomic uncertainty, and as we continue to expand our business beyond gas delivery systems into new subsystems. In the current economic environment, certain of our suppliers may be forced out of business, which could require us to either procure products from higher-cost suppliers or, if no additional suppliers exist, reconfigure the design and manufacture of our products. This could limit our growth and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf our new products are not accepted by OEMs or other customers or if we are unable to obtain historical margins on our new products, our operating results would be adversely impacted.\nWe design, develop and market critical systems and subsystems to OEMs and other customers. The introduction of new products is inherently risky because it is difficult to foresee the adoption of new standards, coordinate our technical personnel and strategic relationships and win acceptance of new products by OEMs and other customers. We may not be able to recoup design and development expenditures if our new products are not accepted by OEMs or other customers. Newly introduced products typically carry lower gross margins than existing products for several or more quarters following their introduction. If any of our new systems or subsystems are not successful in the market, or if we are unable to obtain gross margins on new products that are similar to the gross margins we have historically achieved, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nInterruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could impair our ability to effectively deliver our products, which could cause us to lose customers and harm our results of operations.\nThe manufacture and delivery of our products depends on the continuing operation of our technology infrastructure and systems, particularly our data center located in California. Any damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our ability to manufacture or deliver products on agreed upon lead times, or at all, on a local or worldwide basis. Interruptions could reduce our sales and profits, and our reputation could be damaged if people believe our systems are unreliable. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, break-ins, hardware or software failures, telecommunications failures, computer viruses or other attempts to harm our systems, and similar events. The critical components of the system are not redundant and we currently do not have a backup data center. Accordingly, while we are in the process of creating a backup data center outside California which is estimated to be completed in the second quarter of 2015, the risk associated with earthquakes, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, and other events beyond our control is heightened.\nAny unscheduled interruption in our manufacturing or deliveries would result in an immediate loss of sales and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial position. If we experience frequent or persistent system failures, the attractiveness of our products to customers could be permanently harmed. Any steps we take to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems may be expensive, reduce\nour operating margin and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled interruptions.\nAcquisitions could result in operating and integration difficulties, dilution, margin deterioration and other consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe have made, and may in the future make, acquisitions of, or significant investments in, businesses that offer complementary products, services, technologies or market access. We expect that management will evaluate potential strategic transactions regularly with its advisors and our board of directors in the ordinary course of business. We may not be successful in negotiating the terms of potential acquisitions or financing potential acquisitions, and our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other challenges associated with an acquired business, product or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, product quality or product architecture, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee or customer retention issues. In addition, we may not be successful in effectively integrating the acquired business, product or technology into our existing business and operations. The areas where we face risks include:\n\u2022\nManagement of the larger, more complex, combined business, including integrating supply and distribution channels, computer and accounting systems, and other aspects of operations;\n\u2022\nDeterioration of gross margins due to the acquisition of the same customer base resulting in reduced pricing leverage;\n\u2022\nIntegration of the capabilities of the acquired businesses while maintaining focus on providing consistently high quality products;\n\u2022\nIncorporation of different financial and reporting controls, processes, systems and technologies into our existing business environment;\n\u2022\nUnknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the acquisitions for which we do not have recourse under their respective agreements;\n\u2022\nPerformance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management\u2019s attention from the companies\u2019 operations;\n\u2022\nCultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired business into our organization, and retention of employees from the businesses we acquire;\n\u2022\nRetention of customers and partners of acquired business; and/or\n\u2022\nDifficulties associated with the transition of customers into our existing business.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities and substantial costs, and materially harm our business generally.\nOur acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, impairment charges and restructuring charges, any of which could harm our financial condition or results. Also, the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions or investments may not materialize. Even if an acquisition or other investment is not completed, we may incur significant management time and effort and financial cost in evaluating such acquisition or investment, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Furthermore, due to limited liquidity in the credit market and our existing leverage, the financing of any such acquisition may be difficult to obtain, and the terms of such financing may not be favorable.\nIf we were required to write down all or part of our goodwill, our net income and net worth could be materially adversely affected.\nWe had $55.9 million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 26, 2014. This amount is likely to increase with our acquisition of Marchi in February 2015. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net tangible and finite lived, identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations. If our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet, it could indicate a decline in our value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill has been impaired. During the fourth quarter of each year, we perform an annual review of our goodwill to determine if it has become impaired, in which case we would write down the impaired portion of our goodwill. We also evaluate goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If we were required to write down all or a significant part of our goodwill, our financial results and net worth could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business is largely dependent on the know-how of our employees, and we generally do not have an intellectual property position that is protected by patents.\nOur business is largely dependent upon our design, engineering, manufacturing and testing know-how. We rely on a combination of trade secrets and contractual confidentiality provisions and, to a much lesser extent, patents, copyrights and trademarks to protect our proprietary rights. Accordingly, our intellectual property position is more vulnerable than it would be if it were protected primarily by patents. If we fail to protect our proprietary rights successfully, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our operating results. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our proprietary rights, and, in the event infringement or breach of our proprietary rights occurs, our competitive position in the market may be harmed. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies and know-how. Further, since our customers generally own the designs and other intellectual property to the products we manufacture, we cannot prevent them from licensing such designs and other intellectual property to our competitors for the manufacture of such products.\nThird parties have claimed and may in the future claim we are infringing their intellectual property, which could subject us to litigation or licensing expenses, and we may be prevented from selling our products if any such claims prove successful.\nWe have in the past and may in the future receive claims that our products, processes or technologies infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. In addition, we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may be applicable to our products. Any litigation regarding our patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and divert our management and key personnel from our business operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The complexity of the technology involved in our products and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks. Claims of intellectual property infringement may also require us to enter into costly license agreements. However, we may not be able to obtain licenses on terms acceptable to us, or at all. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against the development, manufacture and sale of certain of our products if any such claims prove successful. We also rely on design specifications and other intellectual property of our customers in the manufacture of products for such customers. While our customer agreements generally provide for indemnification of us by our customers if we are subjected to litigation for third-party claims of infringement of such customer intellectual property, such indemnification provisions may not be sufficient to fully protect us from such claims, or our customers may breach such indemnification obligations to us, which could result in costly litigation to defend against such claims or enforce our contractual rights to such indemnification.\nIf we do not keep pace with developments in the industries we serve and with technological innovation generally, our products may not be competitive.\nRapid technological innovation in the markets we serve requires us to anticipate and respond quickly to evolving customer requirements and could render our current product offerings and technology obsolete. Technological innovations are inherently complex. We must devote resources to technology development in order to keep pace with such rapidly evolving technologies. We believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to design, engineer and manufacture products that meet the changing needs of our customers. This requires that we successfully anticipate and respond to technological changes in design, engineering and manufacturing processes in a cost-effective and timely manner. If we are unable to integrate new technical specifications into competitive product designs, develop the technical capabilities necessary to manufacture new products or make necessary modifications or enhancements to existing products, our business prospects could be harmed.\nThe timely development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process which requires that we:\n\u2022\ndesign innovative and performance-enhancing features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nidentify emerging technological trends in the industries we serve, including new standards for our products;\n\u2022\naccurately identify and design new products to meet market needs;\n\u2022\ncollaborate with OEMs to design and develop products on a timely and cost-effective basis;\n\u2022\nramp-up production of new products, especially new subsystems, in a timely manner and with acceptable yields at acceptable costs;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully manage development production cycles; and\n\u2022\nrespond effectively to technological changes or product announcements by others.\nIf we are unsuccessful in keeping pace with technological developments for the reasons above or other reasons, our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe industries in which we participate are highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our operating results will be harmed.\nWe face intense competition from subsystem and component manufacturers in the industries we serve. Increased competition has in the past resulted, and could in the future result, in price reductions, reduced gross margins or loss of market share, any of which would harm our operating results. We are subject to significant pricing pressure as we attempt to maintain and increase market share with our existing customers. Competitors may offer reduced prices or introduce new products for the markets currently served by our products. These products may have better performance, lower prices and achieve broader market acceptance than our products. Further, OEMs typically own the design rights to their products and may provide these designs to other subsystem manufacturers. If our competitors obtain proprietary rights to these designs such that we are unable to obtain the designs necessary to manufacture products for our OEM customers, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur competitors may have greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products, and reduce prices to increase market share. Moreover, there may be merger and acquisition activity among our\ncompetitors and potential competitors that may provide our competitors and potential competitors an advantage over us by enabling them to expand their product offerings and service capabilities to meet a broader range of customer needs. Further, if one of our customers develops or acquires the internal capability to develop and produce critical systems or subsystems that we produce, the loss of that customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. The introduction of new technologies and new market entrants may also increase competitive pressures.\nWe must achieve design wins to retain our existing customers and to obtain new customers.\nNew capital equipment typically has a lifespan of several years, and OEMs frequently specify which systems, subsystems, components and instruments are to be used in their equipment. Once a specific system, subsystem, component or instrument is incorporated into a piece of capital equipment, it will likely continue to be incorporated into that piece of equipment for at least several months before the OEM would be in a position to switch to the product of another supplier. Accordingly, it is important that our products are designed into the new capital equipment of OEMs, which we refer to as a design win, in order to retain our competitive position with existing customers and to obtain new customers.\nWe incur technology development and sales expenses with no assurance that our products will ultimately be designed into an OEM\u2019s capital equipment. Further, developing new customer relationships, as well as maintaining and increasing our market share at existing customers, requires a substantial investment of our sales, engineering and management resources without any assurance from prospective customers that they will place significant orders. We believe that OEMs often consider long-term relationships in selecting and placing orders with suppliers. Accordingly, we may have difficulty achieving design wins from OEMs that are not currently our customers. Our operating results and potential growth could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve design wins with leading OEMs.\nDefects in our products could damage our reputation, decrease market acceptance of our products, cause the unintended release of hazardous materials and result in potentially costly litigation or indemnification liability.\nA number of factors, including design flaws, material and component failures, workmanship issues, contamination in the manufacturing environment, impurities in the materials used and unknown sensitivities to process conditions, such as temperature and humidity, as well as equipment failures, may cause our products to contain undetected errors or defects. Problems with our products may:\n\u2022\ncause delays in product introductions and shipments for us or our customers;\n\u2022\nresult in increased costs and diversion of development resources;\n\u2022\ncause us to incur increased charges due to unusable inventory;\n\u2022\nrequire design modifications;\n\u2022\nresult in liability for the unintended release of hazardous materials or other damages to our or our customers\u2019 property;\n\u2022\ncreate claims for rework, replacement and/or damages under our contracts with customers, as well as indemnification claims from customers;\n\u2022\ndecrease market acceptance of, or customer satisfaction with, our products, which could result in decreased sales and product returns; or\n\u2022\nresult in lower yields for semiconductor manufacturers.\nIf any of our products contain defects or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation might be damaged and customers might be reluctant to buy our products. We may also face a higher rate of\nproduct defects as we increase our production levels. Product defects could result in warranty and indemnification liability, the loss of existing customers or impair our ability to attract new customers. In addition, we may not find defects or failures in our products until after they are installed in a manufacturer\u2019s fabrication facility. We may have to invest significant capital and other resources to correct these problems. Our current or potential customers also might seek to recover from us any losses resulting from defects or failures in our products. Hazardous materials flow through and are controlled by our products and an unintended release of these materials could result in serious injury or death. Liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or pay significant damages or indemnification claims.\nThe technology labor market is very competitive, and our business will suffer if we are unable to hire and retain key personnel.\nOur future success depends in part on the continued service of our key executive officers, as well as our research, engineering, sales, manufacturing and administrative personnel, most of whom are not subject to employment or non-competition agreements. In addition, competition for qualified personnel in the technology industry is intense, and we operate in geographic locations in which labor markets are particularly competitive.\nOur business is particularly dependent on expertise which only a limited number of engineers possess. The loss of any of our key employees and officers, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), our Chief Financial Officer, any of our Senior Vice Presidents or any of the senior managers, or the failure to attract and retain new qualified employees, could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Further, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Clarence L. Granger retired as our CEO effective January 19, 2015. If our transition of Mr. Granger\u2019s roles and responsibilities to our new CEO, James P Scholhamer is not successful, our business, financial results and financial position could be materially adversely affected.\nThe challenges of employee retention has also increased during the integration process with AIT because of the necessity of combining personnel with varied business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures and objectives, and several AIT employees, including members of AIT\u2019s senior management, have left our company. The process of integrating operations and making such adjustments could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of our businesses and the loss of key personnel. Employee uncertainty, lack of focus or turnover during the integration process may also disrupt our businesses. We may experience similar challenges with the integration of Marchi\u2019s employees and business.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we might not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud; in that case, our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and could negatively impact the price of our stock.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. In addition, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us and our independent registered public accounting firm to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. The process of designing, implementing, maintaining and updating our internal controls and complying with Section 404 is expensive and time consuming, and requires significant attention from management and company resources. In addition, beginning in fiscal year 2013, we were required to evaluate and report on AIT\u2019s internal controls and the attestation report we are required to obtain from our independent registered public accounting firm must include AIT\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Integrating AIT\u2019s internal control framework into the Company and upgrading AIT\u2019s controls to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has required substantial resources, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully or effectively maintain adequate controls over our financial processes at AIT or for our consolidated business. In addition, even though we have concluded, and our independent registered public accounting firm has concurred, that our internal control over financial reporting provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as of December 26, 2014, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect fraud\nor misstatements, and our internal control may not be effective as of future periods. Failure to maintain existing or implement new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we or our independent registered public accounting firm discover a material weakness, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, could reduce the market\u2019s confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur international sales are denominated primarily, though not entirely, in U.S. dollars. Many of the costs and expenses associated with our Chinese subsidiaries and Singapore subsidiary are paid in Chinese Renminbi and Singapore dollars, respectively, and we expect our exposure to Chinese Renminbi and Singapore dollars to increase as we increase production in those facilities. In addition, purchases of some of our components are denominated in Japanese Yen and Euros. Changes in exchange rates among other currencies in which our revenue or costs are denominated and the U.S. dollar may affect our revenue, cost of sales and operating margins. While fluctuations in the value of our revenue, cost of sales and operating margins as measured in U.S. dollars have not materially affected our results of operations historically, we do not currently hedge our foreign exchange exposure, and exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nIf environmental contamination were to occur in one of our manufacturing facilities, we could be subject to substantial liabilities.\nWe use substances regulated under various foreign, domestic, federal, state and local environmental laws in our manufacturing facilities. In addition, we may not be aware of or in compliance with all environmental laws or regulations that could subject us to liability in the U.S. or internationally. Our failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental laws could result in significant remediation liabilities, the imposition of fines or the suspension or termination of the production of our products, and thus a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, power outages, floods, and other catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made disruptions, such as terrorism.\nOur facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by natural disasters, including fires and earthquakes. We have facilities in areas with above average seismic activity, such as our manufacturing facility in South San Francisco, California and our manufacturing and headquarters facilities in Hayward, California. If any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, reduce revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. In addition, we have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, extended power outages at our facilities. We do not carry insurance policies that cover potential losses caused by earthquakes or other natural disasters or power loss.\nIn addition, disruption in supply resulting from natural disasters or other causalities or catastrophic events, such as earthquakes, severe weather such as storms or floods, fires, labor disruptions, power outages, terrorist attacks or political unrest, may result in certain of our suppliers being unable to deliver sufficient quantities of components or raw materials at all or in a timely manner, disruptions in our operations or disruptions in our customers\u2019 operations. For example, in 2011, the northern region of Japan experienced a severe earthquake followed by a tsunami. These geological events caused significant damage in that region and adversely affected Japan\u2019s infrastructure and economy. Some of our suppliers are located in Japan and they have experienced, and may experience in the future, shutdowns or disruptions as a result of these types of events, and their operations may be negatively impacted by these events. Many of our customers and suppliers are also located in California, and may be subject to the same risk of seismic activity as described for us above.\nTo the extent that natural disasters or other calamities or causalities should result in delays or cancellations of customer orders, or the delay in the manufacture or shipment of our products or services, our business, financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected.\nChanges in tax rates or tax assets and liabilities could affect results of operations.\nAs a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Our future annual and quarterly tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the: (1) applicable tax laws; (2) amount and composition of pre-tax income in countries with differing tax rates; or (3) valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nIn addition, we are subject to regular examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and from time to time we initiate amendments to previously filed tax returns. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, which requires estimates and judgments. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates. We may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates, which may be time-consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that we will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are currently enjoying a zero rate tax holiday in Singapore that is scheduled to expire at the end of fiscal year 2015. This tax rate is subject to achieving certain commitments agreed to with the Singapore tax authorities, including investment and employment thresholds, and our tax rate could be significantly affected if we are unable to meet these commitments or if we are unable to favorably renegotiate the commitment requirements.\nThe market for our stock is subject to significant fluctuation.\nThe size of our public market capitalization is relatively small, and the average volume of our shares that are traded is relatively low. The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully introduce new products and manage new product transitions;\n\u2022\nchanges in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports by analysts;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us, our customers or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nannouncements relating to any of our key customers, significant suppliers or the semiconductor manufacturing and capital equipment industry generally;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions;\n\u2022\nthe effects of war and terrorist attacks; and\n\u2022\ndomestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance.\nThe stock markets in general, and the markets for technology stocks in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nNew regulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. As a result, in August 2012 the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. These new requirements will require us to perform on-going due diligence efforts on our supply chain and require public disclosure of the nature and results of these efforts. There will be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. Complying with these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products and result in substantial additional costs. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d conflict minerals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement. In addition, if we are unable to comply with these rules, we could be subject to enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission and liability under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which could result in material adverse consequences to our business, as well as significant fines and penalties.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to declare and pay dividends on our capital stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Additionally, the terms of the credit agreements we entered into in July 2012 and in February 2015 restrict our ability to pay dividends. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 90097, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "UCTT"}
