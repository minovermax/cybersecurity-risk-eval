RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The occurrence of any of the following risks or of unknown risks and uncertainties may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSUMMARY RISK FACTORS\nSome of the factors that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe disruptions in the U.S. and global economy and is expected to continue to impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Poor performance of the funds we manage would cause a decline in our revenue and results of operations, may obligate us to repay performance fees previously paid to us and would adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future funds.\n\u2022We depend on certain key personnel and the loss of their services would have a material adverse effect on us.\n\u2022Changes in the U.S. political environment and the potential for governmental policy changes and regulatory reform could negatively impact our business, and we could be adversely affected by economic, political, fiscal and/or other developments in or affecting other countries.\n\u2022Difficult market or economic conditions may adversely affect our businesses in many ways, including by reducing the value or hampering the performance of the investments made by our funds or reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, each of which could materially reduce our revenue, net income and cash flow and adversely affect our financial prospects and condition.\n\u2022We may not be successful in raising new funds or in raising more capital for certain of our existing funds and may face pressure on performance fees and fee arrangements of our future funds.\n\u2022Our funds\u2019 reported net asset values, rates of return and the performance fees we receive are subject to a number of factors beyond our control and are based in large part upon estimates of the fair value of our funds\u2019 investments, which are based on subjective standards that may prove to be incorrect.\n\u2022We have experienced rapid growth, which may be difficult to sustain and which may place significant demands on our administrative, operational and financial resources.\n\u2022Extensive regulation of our businesses affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties. The possibility of increased regulatory focus could result in additional burdens on our businesses.\n\u2022A portion of our revenues, earnings and cash flow is highly variable, which may make it difficult for us to achieve steady earnings growth on a quarterly basis.\n\u2022The investment management business is intensely competitive, which could have a material adverse impact on us.\n\u2022We may not be successful in expanding into new investment strategies, markets and businesses, each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our businesses.\n\u2022Many of our funds invest in relatively high-risk, illiquid assets and we may fail to realize any profits from these assets for a considerable period of time or lose some or all of the principal amount we invest in these assets.\n\u2022We rely on technology and information systems to conduct our businesses, and any failures or interruptions of these systems could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations. Additionally, we face operational risks in the execution, confirmation or settlement of transactions and our dependence on our third-party providers.\n\u2022We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from funds managed pursuant to management agreements that may be terminated or fund partnership agreements that permit fund investors to request liquidation of investments in our funds.\n\u2022Our use of leverage to finance our businesses exposes us to substantial risks, which are exacerbated by our funds\u2019 use of leverage to finance investments.\n\u2022We are subject to third-party litigation from time to time that could result in significant liabilities and reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\n\u2022Our failure to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest could damage our reputation and adversely affect our businesses.\n\u2022Employee misconduct or misconduct by our advisers or third party-service providers could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain investors and by subjecting us to significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.\n\u2022Underwriting, syndicating and securities placement activities expose us to risks.\n\u2022We have a strategic relationship with Athene and Athora from which we derive a significant contribution to our revenue and that could give rise to real or apparent conflicts of interest.\n\u2022We make investments in companies that are based outside of the U.S., which may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in companies that are based in the U.S.\n\u2022Third-party investors in our funds have the right under certain circumstances to terminate commitment periods or to dissolve the funds, and investors in some of our credit funds may redeem their investments in such funds under certain circumstances at any time, and, under other circumstances, after an initial holding period. These events would lead to a decrease in our revenues, which could be substantial.\n\u2022Our funds\u2019 performance, and our performance, may be adversely affected by the financial performance of our funds\u2019 portfolio companies and the industries in which our funds invest.\n\u2022The market price and trading volume of our Class A shares and our Preferred shares may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders.\n\u2022An investment in Class A shares and our Preferred shares is not an investment in any of our funds, and the assets and revenues of our funds are not directly available to us.\n\u2022We cannot assure you that our intended quarterly dividends will be paid each quarter or at all.\n\u2022Our Class C Stockholder\u2019s significant voting power limits the ability of holders of our Class A shares to influence our business, and control by our Managing Partners of the combined voting power of our shares and holding their economic interests through the Apollo Operating Group may give rise to conflicts of interest.\n\u2022Our board of directors has delegated all of its powers and authority in the management of the business and affairs of the Company to an executive committee currently made up of our Managing Partners, and certain actions by our board of directors require the approval of the Class C Stockholder, which is controlled by our Managing Partners.\n\u2022We qualify for, and rely on, exceptions from certain corporate governance and other requirements under the rules of the NYSE.\n\u2022Our structure involves complex provisions of U.S. federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available. Our structure is also subject to on-going future potential legislative, judicial or administrative change and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.\nRisks Related to Our Businesses\nMacroeconomic Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe disruptions in the U.S. and global economy and is expected to continue to impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted global commercial activity and contributed to significant volatility in financial markets. The impact of the outbreak continues to develop and many countries, including the U.S., have instituted quarantines, restrictions on travel, bans and/or limitations on public events and on public gatherings, closures of a variety of venues (e.g., restaurants, concert halls, museums, theaters, schools and stadiums, non-essential stores, malls and other entertainment facilities, and commercial buildings), shelter-in-place orders or other restrictions on operations and businesses. Businesses have also implemented protective measures, such as work-from-home arrangements, partial or full shutdowns of operations, furlough or termination of employees and cancellation of customer, employee or industry events. Those measures,\nas well as the general uncertainty surrounding the dangers and effects of COVID-19, have created significant disruption in global supply chains, and have adversely impacted a number of industries, such as transportation, hospitality and entertainment. The effects of COVID-19 have led to significant volatility and it is uncertain how long this volatility will continue. As COVID-19 continues to spread, the potential effects, including a global, regional or other economic recession, are uncertain and difficult to assess. The continued spread of the virus globally could lead to a protracted world-wide economic downturn, the effects of which could last for some period after the pandemic is controlled and/or abated. The effect of the COVID-19 outbreak on the economy and the public has been severe and could exacerbate other pre-existing political, social, economic, market and financial risks.\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on us, the funds we manage and their portfolio investments, will depend on many factors, including the duration and scope of the public health emergency, the actions taken by governmental authorities to contain its financial and economic impact, the continued or renewed implementation of travel advisories and restrictions, the efficacy and availability of COVID-19 vaccines, the impact of the public health emergency on overall supply and demand, goods and services, consumer confidence and levels of economic activity and the extent of its disruption to global, regional and local supply chains and economic markets, all of which are uncertain and difficult to assess. If effective vaccines are not widely available to the public, or if vaccines offer only limited protection, including as the result of the development of new strains of COVID-19, we expect to see continued fluctuations in business openings and closures as communities respond to local outbreaks, which could prolong the global economic impact. The extended duration of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business in a number of ways. Some examples include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022Difficult market and economic conditions may adversely impact the valuations of our and our funds\u2019 investments, particularly if the value of an investment is determined in whole or in part by reference to public equity markets. Valuations of our and our funds\u2019 investments are generally correlated to the performance of the relevant equity and debt markets;\n\u2022Limitation on travel and social distancing requirements implemented in response to COVID-19 may challenge our ability to market new or successor funds as anticipated prior to COVID-19, resulting in less or delayed revenues. In addition, fund investors may become restricted by their asset allocation policies in investing in new or successor funds that we manage, because these policies often restrict the amount that they are permitted to invest in alternative assets like the strategies of our investment funds in light of the recent decline in public equity markets;\n\u2022While the market dislocation caused by COVID-19 may present attractive investment opportunities, due to increased volatility in the financial markets, we may not be able to complete those investments;\n\u2022Any asset price inflation driven by COVID-19\u2019s market dislocation may hamper our and our funds\u2019 ability to deploy capital or to deploy capital as profitably as we could if asset prices were not inflated;\n\u2022If the impact of COVID-19 continues, we and our funds may have fewer opportunities to successfully exit existing investments, due to, among other reasons, lower valuations, decreased revenues and earnings, lack of potential buyers with financial resources to pursue an acquisition, or limited or no ability to conduct initial public offerings in equity capital markets, resulting in a reduced ability to realize value from such investments;\n\u2022The pandemic may strain our liquidity. Declines or delays in realized performance revenues and management fees would adversely impact our cash flows and liquidity. While as of December 31, 2020, we had $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury securities, as well as $750 million available capacity under our revolving credit facility, to the extent we incur additional debt relative to our current level of earnings or experience a decrease in our level of earnings as a result of COVID-19 or otherwise, our credit rating could be adversely impacted. Any downgrade in our credit rating would increase our interest expense under our existing credit facility and could limit the availability of future financing;\n\u2022Our funds\u2019 portfolio companies are facing or may face in the future increased credit and liquidity risk due to volatility in financial markets, reduced revenue streams, and limited or higher cost of access to preferred sources of funding, which may result in potential impairment of our or our funds\u2019 equity investments. Changes in the debt financing markets are impacting, or, if the volatility in financial market continues, may in the future impact, the ability of our funds\u2019 portfolio companies to meet their respective financial obligations. Failure to meet any such financial obligations could result in our funds\u2019 portfolio investments being subject to margin calls or being required to repay indebtedness or other financial obligations immediately in whole or in part, together with any attendant costs, and our funds\u2019 portfolio investments could be forced to sell some of their assets to fund such costs. In the event of any such consequences, our funds could lose both invested capital in, and anticipated profits from, the affected investment.\nAdditionally, we and our funds may experience similar difficulties, and certain funds may be subject to margin calls when the value of securities that collateralize their margin loans decrease substantially;\n\u2022Borrowers of loans, notes and other credit instruments in our funds\u2019 portfolios may not meet their principal or interest payment obligations or satisfy financial covenants, and tenants leasing real estate properties owned by our funds may not pay rents in a timely manner or at all, resulting in a decrease in value of our funds\u2019 credit and real estate investments and lower than expected return. In addition, for variable interest instruments, lower reference rates resulting from government stimulus programs in response to COVID-19 could lead to lower interest income for our funds;\n\u2022Many of the portfolio companies of the funds we manage operate in industries that are materially impacted by COVID-19, including but not limited to healthcare, travel, entertainment, hospitality, senior living and retail industries. Many of these companies are facing operational and financial hardships resulting from the spread of COVID-19 and related governmental measures, such as the closure of stores, restrictions on travel, quarantines or stay-at-home orders. If the disruptions caused by COVID-19 continue and the restrictions put in place are not lifted, the businesses of these portfolio companies could continue to suffer materially or become insolvent, which would decrease the value of our funds\u2019 investments;\n\u2022The stimulus package provided by the U.S. government and its various agencies to businesses in the U.S., including some of our funds\u2019 portfolio companies, restricts the recipient business from taking certain decisions, such as dividends and share buybacks. Such limitations may reduce the value of our funds\u2019 investments in such companies;\n\u2022The success of our funds\u2019 investments depends to some extent on our ability to understand, and even foresee, trends and changes in the economy, the political landscape and society, as well as specific industries. However, the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on consumer preferences and behavior; global supply chains; real estate occupancy and usage, among other things, remain to be seen. If we fail to understand or correctly interpret such changes and trends, the performance of our funds\u2019 investments may suffer;\n\u2022A continued extended period of remote working by our employees could strain our technology resources and introduce operational risks, including heightened cybersecurity risk. Remote working environments may be less secure and more susceptible to hacking attacks, including phishing and social engineering attempts that seek to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022COVID-19 presents a significant threat to our employees\u2019 well-being and morale. While we have implemented a business continuity plan to protect the health of our employees and have contingency plans in place for key employees or executive officers who may become sick or otherwise unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time, such plans cannot anticipate all scenarios, and we may experience potential loss of productivity or a delay in the rollout of certain strategic plans. The longer-term effects of COVID-19 on the workplace and workforce remain unclear. An extended period of remote working may hinder our ability to attract, train, and retain talent, and may impact our ability to sustain our firm culture.\nWe are continuing to monitor the impact of COVID-19 and related risks, including risks related to efforts to mitigate the disease\u2019s spread, although the rapid development and fluidity of the situation precludes any prediction as to its ultimate impact on our business, financial performance and operating results. However, if the spread and related mitigation efforts continue, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nChanges in the U.S. political environment and the potential for governmental policy changes and regulatory reform could negatively impact our business, and we could be adversely affected by economic, political, fiscal and/or other developments in or affecting other countries.\nGovernmental policy changes and regulatory reform could have a material impact on our business. Uncertainty with respect to legislation, regulation and government policy at the federal level, as well as the state and local levels have introduced new and difficult-to-quantify macroeconomic and political risks with potentially far-reaching implications. There has been a corresponding meaningful increase in the uncertainty surrounding interest rates, inflation, foreign exchange rates, trade volumes and fiscal and monetary policy. Such uncertainty has been exacerbated by the effects of, and the government\u2019s response to, the COVID-19 pandemic. The potential for changes in policy and regulation is heightened significantly by the change in the U.S. administration. New legislative, regulatory or policy changes could significantly impact our business and the business of portfolio companies of funds we manage, as well as the markets in which we compete. Furthermore, negative public sentiment could lead to heightened scrutiny and criticisms of our business model generally, or our business and investments in particular. For example, in June 2019, certain members of Congress introduced the Stop Wall Street Looting Act of 2019, a\ncomprehensive bill intended to fundamentally reform the private equity industry. In addition, disagreements over the federal budget have led to the shutdown of the U.S. federal government for periods of time and may recur in the future. Each federal shutdown may have a negative impact on the operations and business of certain of our funds\u2019 portfolio companies. To the extent changes in the political environment have a negative impact on us or portfolio companies of funds we manage, or on the markets in which we operate, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in the future.\nDifficult market or economic conditions may adversely affect our businesses in many ways, including by reducing the value or hampering the performance of the investments made by our funds or reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, each of which could materially reduce our revenue, net income and cash flow and adversely affect our financial prospects and condition.\nOur businesses and the businesses of the companies in which our funds invest are materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions throughout the world, such as interest rates, availability of credit, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws (including laws relating to taxation), trade barriers, commodity prices, currency exchange rates and controls, national and international political circumstances (including wars, terrorist acts or security operations), natural disasters, climate change, pandemics or other severe public health crises and other events outside of our control. Recently, markets have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, interest rates in the U.S., imposition of trade barriers, ongoing trade negotiations with major U.S. trading partners and changes in the U.S. tax regulations. Additionally, operating outside the U.S. may also expose us to increased compliance risks, as well as higher compliance costs to comply with U.S. and non-U.S. anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and regulations. These factors are outside our control and may affect the level and volatility of securities prices and the liquidity and the value of investments, and we may not be able to or may choose not to manage our exposure to these conditions.\nVolatility in the financial markets can materially hinder the initiation of new, large-sized transactions for our private equity segment and, together with volatility in valuations of equity and debt securities, may adversely impact our operating results. If market conditions deteriorate, our businesses could be affected in different ways. In addition, volatility and general economic trends are likely to impact the performance of portfolio companies in many industries, particularly industries that are more affected by changes in consumer demand, such as the packaging, manufacturing, chemical and refining industries, as well as travel and leisure, gaming and real estate industries. The performance of our funds and our performance may be adversely affected to the extent our funds\u2019 portfolio companies in these industries experience adverse performance or additional pressure due to downward trends. There is also a risk of both sector-specific and broad-based corrections and/or downturns in the equity and/or credit markets beyond those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our profitability may also be adversely affected by our fixed costs and the possibility that we would be unable to scale back other costs, within a time frame sufficient to match any further decreases in net income or increases in net losses relating to changes in market and economic conditions.\nA financial downturn could adversely affect our operating results in a number of ways, and if the economy was to enter an inflationary period or if the recession caused by COVID-19 were to continue or to get worse, our revenue and results of operations would decline by causing:\n\u2022our AUM to decrease, lowering management fees and other income from our funds;\n\u2022increases in costs of financial instruments;\n\u2022adverse conditions for the portfolio companies of our funds (e.g., decreased revenues, liquidity pressures, limits on interest deductibility, increased difficulty in obtaining access to financing and complying with the terms of existing financings as well as increased financing costs);\n\u2022lower investment returns, reducing performance fees;\n\u2022higher interest rates, which could increase the cost of the debt capital our funds use to make investments; and\n\u2022material reductions in the value of our fund investments, affecting our ability to realize performance fees from these investments.\nLower investment returns and such material reductions in value may result because, among other reasons, during periods of difficult market conditions or slowdowns (which may be across one or more industries, sectors or geographies), companies in which our funds invest may experience decreased revenues, financial losses, difficulty in obtaining access to financing and increased funding costs. During such periods, these companies may also have difficulty in expanding their businesses and operations and be unable to meet their debt service obligations or other expenses as they become due, including\nexpenses payable to us. In addition, during periods of adverse economic conditions, our funds and their portfolio companies may have difficulty accessing financial markets, which could make it more difficult or impossible to obtain funding for additional investments and harm our AUM and operating results. Furthermore, such conditions would also increase the risk of default with respect to debt investments made by our funds, which could have a negative impact on our funds with significant debt investments, such as our credit funds. Our funds may be affected by reduced opportunities to exit and realize value from their investments, by lower than expected returns on investments made prior to the deterioration of the credit markets, and by the fact that we may not be able to find suitable investments for the funds to effectively deploy capital, which could adversely affect our ability to raise new funds and thus adversely impact our prospects for future growth.\nTo the extent the uncertainty in the market prompts sellers to readjust their valuations, attractive investment opportunities may present themselves. On the other hand, the reduction in the availability of debt financing and limits on interest deductibility could impact our funds\u2019 ability to consummate transactions, particularly larger transactions. In the event that our investment pace slows, it could have an adverse impact on our ability to generate future performance fees and fully invest the capital in our funds. Our funds may also be affected by reduced opportunities to exit and realize value from their investments via a sale or merger upon a general slowdown in corporate mergers and acquisitions activity. Additionally, we may not be able to find suitable investments for the funds to effectively deploy capital and these factors could adversely affect the timing of and our ability to raise new funds.\nIn addition, many other economies continue to experience weakness, tighter credit conditions and a decreased availability of foreign capital. Further, there is concern that the favorability of conditions in certain markets may be dependent on continued monetary policy accommodation from central banks, especially the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the \u201cFederal Reserve\u201d) and the European Central Bank (\u201cECB\u201d). In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve and the ECB have taken actions which have resulted in low interest rates prevailing in the marketplace. Higher interest rates generally impact the investment management industry by making it harder to obtain financing for new investments, refinance existing investments or liquidate debt investments, which can lead to reduced investment returns and missed investment opportunities. Consequently, such increases in interest rates may have an adverse impact on our business.\nTariffs imposed by the U.S. and potential for retaliatory actions by affected countries may create uncertainty for our funds and our investment strategies and adversely affect the profitability of our funds and us.\nTariffs imposed by the U.S. on products imported into the U.S. and other changes in U.S. trade policy have resulted in, and may continue to trigger, retaliatory actions by affected countries. Certain foreign governments instituted or considered imposing trade sanctions on certain U.S. goods, and others considered the imposition of sanctions that would deny U.S. companies access to critical raw materials. Additionally, certain countries have imposed trade barriers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A \u201ctrade war\u201d of this nature or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies would have the potential to further increase costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of products and services offered by companies in which our funds have current or future investments and adversely affect the revenues and profitability of our funds\u2019 portfolio companies whose businesses rely on goods imported from outside of the U.S. In addition, tariff increases may have a similar impact on suppliers and certain other customers of companies in which our funds have current or future investments, which could increase the negative impact on our operating results or future cash flows. Although it is likely that the incoming Biden administration will choose a more multilateral approach to trade, it is unclear what trade policies will be pursued by the administration and, in particular, how the administration is likely to engage with China.\nThe withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU single market and customs union could have a range of adverse consequences for us, our funds and the portfolio companies of our funds.\nThe U.K. technically withdrew from the EU on January 31, 2020, triggering a negotiated transition period during which the U.K. remained in the EU single market and customs union and remained subject to EU laws and regulations. The transition period ended on December 31, 2020. Various EU laws, rules and guidance have been on-shored into domestic U.K. legislation and certain transitional regimes and deficiency-correction powers exist to ease the transition.\nThe U.K. and the EU announced, on December 24, 2020, that they have reached agreement on a new Trade and Cooperation Agreement (the \u201cTCA\u201d) which addresses a range of aspects of the future relationship between the parties. The TCA was ratified by the U.K. Parliament on December 31, 2020 and, under certain technical arrangements, applies on an interim basis in the EU until formally ratified. The TCA addresses, for example, trade in goods and the ability of U.K. nationals to travel to the EU on business but defers other issues. While the TCA includes a commitment by the U.K. and the EU to keep their markets open for persons wishing to provide financial services through a permanent establishment, it does not address\nsubstantive future cooperation in the sphere of financial services or reciprocal market access into the EU by U.K. firms under so-called \u201cequivalence\u201d arrangements. The European Commission has indicated that its assessment of the U.K.\u2019s replies to its equivalence enquiries remain ongoing and, at this stage, there is no certainty as to when such assessments will be concluded or whether the U.K. will be deemed equivalent in some or all of the individual assessments.\nWhile the TCA provides clarity in some areas, elements of the uncertainty that has accompanied much of the Brexit process to date will continue. This is driven by the ongoing uncertainty relating to equivalence and the extent to which the EU grants reciprocal access to U.K. firms in the sphere of financial services and that, as a new agreement, the implications and operation of the TCA may evolve during the balance of 2021, and potentially beyond that date. That uncertainty to date has resulted in volatility in the U.K. and EU financial markets; foreign exchange fluctuations of the pound sterling relative to the euro and the U.S. dollar; fluctuations in the market value of U.K. and EU assets; increased illiquidity of investments located in and/or listed in the U.K.; and lower growth rates in the U.K. and in the EU. The outcomes following the implementation of the TCA (and any subsequent discussions between the U.K. and EU in respect of matters not within its scope) are likely to affect, among others, trade in goods and services (including the availability of equivalence regimes for financial services firms); immigration and business travel rules, the ability to move employees across borders, and recognition of professional qualifications; legal and regulatory regimes; and market access rules.\nThe impact of this uncertainty as well as that of (a) the TCA (and any subsequent discussions between the U.K. in relation to equivalence assessments for financial services) and (b) the operation of on-shored EU laws, rules and guidance in the U.K. are difficult to predict, and could adversely affect the portfolio companies of our funds, the availability of credit and liquidity for these businesses and the return on our funds and their investments. It is possible, for example, that certain of our funds\u2019 investments may need to be restructured to enable their objectives fully to be pursued (e.g., because of a loss of passporting rights for U.K. financial institutions or the failure to put equally effective arrangements in place). This may increase costs or make it more difficult for us to pursue our objectives.\nThe outcomes discussed above could also affect the ways in which we are able, following the transition period, to operate in the U.K. as well as from the U.K. into the remainder of the EEA (and, vice versa, in relation to any new entities we establish and license in the EEA). This may have an impact on us, including the cost of, risk to, manner of conducting or location of, our European business and our ability to hire and retain key staff in Europe. This may also impact the markets in which we operate; the funds managed or advised by us; our fund investors or our ability to raise capital from them; and ultimately the returns which may be achieved. In this regard, there can be no guarantee that plans to deal with, or mitigate adverse consequences of, Brexit will perfectly or efficiently replicate arrangements which were available to us through to the end of the transition period.\nWe could be adversely affected by economic, political, fiscal and/or other developments in or affecting Eurozone countries.\nOur operating results could be affected by economic, political, fiscal and/or other developments in the Eurozone. The International Monetary Fund in late November 2020 warned that a second wave of COVID-19 infections and lockdowns poses a considerable risk to the Eurozone economy, requiring support through fiscal policies and monetary policies, including purchases of sovereign debt and liquidity support for lenders, as well as support for businesses, particularly small- and medium-sized enterprises. Additionally, the EU\u2019s \u20ac750 billion recovery fund may not be sufficient to support economic recovery. A prolonged public health crisis could have a significant impact on the economic recovery of Eurozone countries, which in turn could adversely affect financial, credit and foreign exchange markets, the ability to access funding in the capital markets or from banks, levels of business activity, business sentiment and consumer confidence. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect our businesses.\nInvestment Management Risks\nPoor performance of the funds we manage would cause a decline in our revenue and results of operations, may obligate us to repay performance fees previously paid to us and would adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future funds.\nWe derive revenues from:\n\u2022management fees, which are based generally on the amount of capital committed or invested in our funds;\n\u2022in connection with services relating to investments by our funds, fees earned or otherwise collected by one or more services providers affiliated with the Apollo Group;\n\u2022performance fees, based on the performance of our funds; and\n\u2022investment income from our investments as general partner.\nIf a fund performs poorly, we will receive little or no performance fees with regard to the fund and little income or possibly losses from any principal investment in the fund. Furthermore, if, as a result of poor performance of later investments in a fund\u2019s life, the fund does not achieve total investment returns that exceed a specified investment return threshold for the life of the fund, we may be obligated to repay the amount by which performance fees that were previously distributed to us exceeds amounts to which we are ultimately entitled. As a result of market deteriorations early in the COVID-19 crisis, several of our funds went into clawback. Most of those funds have rebounded and if they had been liquidated at their fair value as of December 31, 2020, there would have been no clawback repayment obligation or liability. However, as of December 31, 2020, if certain of our funds had been liquidated at their fair value at that date, there would have been a clawback repayment obligation or liability, see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further details. There can be no assurance that we will not incur a clawback repayment obligation in the future. Our fund investors and potential fund investors continually assess our funds\u2019 performance and our ability to raise capital. Accordingly, poor fund performance may deter future investment in our funds and thereby decrease the capital committed or invested in our funds and ultimately, our management fee income.\nChanges in the debt financing markets may negatively impact the ability of our funds and their portfolio companies to obtain attractive financing for their investments and may increase the cost of such financing if it is obtained, which could lead to lower-yielding investments and potentially decrease our net income.\nIn the event that our funds are unable to obtain committed debt financing for potential acquisitions or can only obtain debt at an increased interest rate or otherwise on unfavorable terms, our funds may have difficulty completing otherwise profitable acquisitions or may generate profits that are lower than would otherwise be the case, either of which could lead to a decrease in the investment income earned by us. Any failure by lenders to provide previously committed financing can also expose us to potential claims by sellers of businesses which our funds may have contracted to purchase. Our funds\u2019 portfolio companies regularly access the corporate debt and securitization markets in order to obtain financing for their operations. To the extent that the current credit markets and/or regulatory changes render financing difficult to obtain or more expensive, this may negatively impact the operating performance of such portfolio companies and funds, and lead to lower-yielding investments with respect to such funds and, therefore, lower the investment returns of our funds. Conversely, certain of the strategies pursued by funds we manage benefit from higher interest rates, and a sustained low interest rate environment may negatively impact expected returns for these funds. In addition, to the extent that the current markets make it difficult or impossible for a portfolio company to refinance debt that is maturing in the near term, it may face substantial doubt as to its status as a going concern (which may result in an event of default under various agreements) or it may be unable to repay such debt at maturity and be forced to sell assets, undergo a recapitalization or seek bankruptcy protection.\nA decline in the pace of investment in our funds, an increase in the pace of sales of investments in our funds or an increase in the amount of transaction and advisory fees we share with our fund investors would result in our receiving less revenue from fees.\nA variety of fees that we earn, such as transaction and advisory fees and financing-related fees, are driven in part by the pace at which our funds make investments. Many factors could cause a decline in the pace of investment, including the inability of our investment professionals to identify attractive investment opportunities, competition for such opportunities, decreased availability of capital on attractive terms and our failure to consummate identified investment opportunities because of business, regulatory or legal complexities and adverse developments in the U.S. or global economy or financial markets. Any decline in the pace at which our funds make investments would reduce our transaction and advisory fees and/or financing-related fees and could make it more difficult for us to raise capital. Likewise, during attractive selling environments, our funds may capitalize on increased opportunities to exit investments. Any increase in the pace at which our funds exit investments would reduce transaction and advisory fees. In addition, some of our fund investors have requested, and we expect to continue to receive requests from fund investors, that we share with them a larger portion, or all, of certain types of fees generated by our funds\u2019 investments, such as management consulting fees and merger and acquisition transaction advisory fees, or that expenses arising from the operation of our funds be borne by us alone, rather than the funds. To the extent we accommodate such requests, it would result in a decrease in the amount of fee revenue we could earn. For example, in Fund VIII and Fund IX we agreed that 100% of management consulting fees and merger and acquisition transaction advisory fees will be shared with the management fee paying investors in the fund through a management fee offset mechanism.\nWe are subject to increasing scrutiny from institutional investors with respect to the social impact of investments made by our funds, which may constrain capital deployment opportunities for our funds and adversely impact our ability to raise capital from such investors.\nIn recent years, certain institutional investors, including public pension funds, have placed increasing importance on the implications and social impact of investments made by the funds to which they commit capital, including with respect to environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters. Certain public pension funds have also demonstrated increased activism with respect to existing investments, including by urging asset managers to take certain actions that could adversely impact the value of an investment, or refrain from taking certain actions that could improve the value of an investment. Similarly, certain of our investors, particularly institutional investors, use third-party benchmarks or scores to measure our ESG practices, and decide whether to invest in our funds. At times, certain investors have conditioned future capital commitments on the taking or refraining from taking of such actions, and we may face reputational challenges if we delay or fail to successfully take such actions. Investors\u2019 increased focus and activism related to ESG and similar matters may constrain our capital deployment opportunities. In addition, institutional investors may decide to withdraw previously committed capital from our funds (where such withdrawal is permitted) or to not commit capital to future fundraises as a result of their assessment of our approach to and consideration of the social impact of investments made by our funds. As public pension funds represent a significant portion of our funds\u2019 investor bases, to the extent our access to capital from such investors is impaired, we may not be able to maintain or increase the size of our funds or raise sufficient capital for new funds, which may adversely impact our revenues.\nIn addition, ESG matters have been the subject of increased focus by certain regulators in the EU. Governmental regulators and other authorities in the EU have proposed or implemented a number of initiatives and additional rules and regulations that could adversely affect our business. For example, in December 2016, the European Commission established a \u201cHigh-Level Expert Group on Sustainable Finance.\u201d In May 2018, the European Commission adopted a package of measures relating to its \u201caction plan on sustainable finance,\u201d which included (i) a proposal for a regulation on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, (ii) a proposal for a regulation on disclosures relating to sustainable investments and sustainability risks and amending the EU pension fund directive, IORP II, to include ESG considerations into the advice provided by investment firms and (iii) a proposal for a regulation amending the benchmark regulation (to create a new category of benchmark relating to low carbon and positive carbon investments). EU legislators are expected to adopt new rules to standardize the definition of environmentally sustainable investing. If regulators disagree with the procedures or standards our funds use for ESG investing, or new regulation or legislation, if adopted, requires a methodology of measuring or disclosing ESG impact that is different from our current practice, our business and reputation could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, the action plan contemplates establishing a \u201ctaxonomy\u201d for sustainable activities, establishing EU labels for green financial products, introducing measures to clarify asset managers\u2019 and institutional investors\u2019 duties regarding sustainability in their investment decision-making processes, strengthening the transparency of companies on their ESG policies and introducing a \u201cgreen supporting factor\u201d in the EU prudential rules for banks and insurance companies to incorporate climate risks into banks\u2019 and insurance companies\u2019 risk management policies. In December 2019, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union approved the Regulation on the Establishment of a Framework to Facilitate Sustainable Investment (the \u201cTaxonomy Regulation\u201d). The Taxonomy Regulation sets forth a general framework for the development of an EU-wide classification system for environmentally sustainable economic activities, with certain provisions scheduled to take effect in 2021 and 2022. Although the specifics of the taxonomy for sustainable activities have yet to be agreed and published, there is a risk that a significant reorientation in the market could be adverse to our investment businesses, at least in the short term, and to our funds\u2019 portfolio companies if they are perceived to be less valuable as a consequence of, for example, their carbon footprint.\nThe action plan further includes the EU\u2019s Regulation on sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services sector (the \u201csustainable finance disclosure regulation\u201d or \u201cSFDR\u201d). SFDR is expected to come into effect on March 10, 2021. The SFDR requires financial market participants falling within its scope to make new disclosures on ESG matters, including both publicly on a website, and in pre-contractual documentation for financial products. The disclosure requirements relate to, amongst other things, the integration of sustainability risks into investment decision-making processes and remuneration policies, the likely impact of sustainability risks on the returns of financial products, and additional anti-\u201cgreenwashing\u201d disclosures for those products which either promote sustainability characteristics or have a sustainable investment objective. If regulators disagree with the disclosures we make for SFDR purposes, or with the categorization of our financial products, we may face regulatory enforcement action, and our business or reputation could be adversely affected. If investors, allocators or intermediaries are dissatisfied with the nature and scope of our SFDR disclosures, relative to our peers, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage, which may adversely affect our ability to retain or raise capital for our funds, which may adversely affect our revenues.\nIn addition, in-scope financial market participants are required to \u201ccomply or explain\u201d whether to adhere to a values-based investing regime codified within SFDR, known as the principal adverse impact (\u201cPAI\u201d) regime. SFDR requires firms adhering to the PAI regime to conduct investment due diligence based on the harm that their investment positions may cause to\na prescribed list of ESG indicators. If we opt to explain non-compliance with the PAI regime, while such an approach is legally permitted, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage relative to firms which choose to comply with the PAI regime, if investors, allocators or intermediaries prefer to invest with financial market participants which adhere to the PAI regime, which may adversely affect our revenues and reputation.\nThe SFDR is intended to be supplemented by further regulatory technical standards (the \u201cRTS\u201d), which will provide further technical details on the disclosure requirements for the PAI regime and for products which either promote sustainability characteristics or have a sustainable investment objective. The RTS will not be in force by March 10, 2021, when SFDR is expected to come into effect, and, in its absence, firms have been instructed by the European Commission to adopt a model of \u201cprinciples based compliance\u201d with SFDR. Principles-based compliance requires us to make individual judgments on how to comply with complex legislation, which carries legal risk given the inherent uncertainties of making individual judgments in the place of technical standards, and exposes us to the risk of regulatory criticism or enforcement, if a relevant regulator objects to our decisions.\nWe may not be successful in raising new funds or in raising more capital for certain of our existing funds and may face pressure on performance fees and fee arrangements of our future funds.\nOur funds may not be successful in consummating their capital-raising efforts, or they may consummate them at investment levels lower than those currently anticipated. Any capital raising that our funds undertake may be on terms that are unfavorable to us or that are otherwise different from the terms that we have been able to obtain in the past. These risks could occur for reasons beyond our control, including general economic or market conditions, regulatory changes or increased competition.\nCertain institutional investors have also publicly criticized certain fund fee and expense structures, including management, transaction and advisory fees. The Institutional Limited Partners Association (\u201cILPA\u201d) maintains and revises from time to time a set of Private Equity Principles (\u201cPrinciples\u201d), which continue to call for enhanced \u201calignment of interests\u201d between general partners and limited partners through modifications of some of the terms of fund arrangements, including guidelines for fees and performance fees structures. We provided ILPA our endorsement of the Principles, representing an indication of our general support for the efforts of ILPA. Although we have no obligation to modify any of our fees or other terms with respect to our funds, we experience pressure to do so.\nIn addition, certain institutional investors, including sovereign wealth funds and public pension funds, continue to demonstrate an increased preference for alternatives to the traditional investment fund structure, such as managed accounts, specialized funds and co-investment vehicles. We also have entered into strategic partnerships with certain institutional investors whereby we manage that investor\u2019s capital across a variety of our products on separately negotiated terms. There can be no assurance that such alternatives will be as profitable to us as traditional investment fund structures, and the impact such a trend could have on our results of operations, if widely implemented, is unclear. Moreover, certain institutional investors continue to demonstrate a preference to in-source their own investment professionals and to make direct investments in alternative assets without the assistance of investment advisers like us. Such institutional investors may become our competitors and could cease to be our clients. Further, certain investors have implemented or may implement restrictions against investing in certain types of asset classes such as fossil fuels, which would affect our ability to raise new funds focused on those asset classes, such as funds focused on energy or natural resources. Finally, the ability of our funds to raise capital from certain investors may also be adversely impacted as a result of countries implementing certain tax avoidance measures as part of the OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (\u201cBEPS\u201d) project if these investors decide to invest on their own or only in funds with similarly situated investors. See \u201c-We make investments in companies that are based outside of the U.S., which may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in companies that are based in the U.S.\u201d\nThe failure of our funds to raise capital in sufficient amounts and on satisfactory terms could result in a decrease in AUM, performance fees and/or fee revenue or could result in us being unable to achieve an increase in AUM, performance fees and/or fee revenue, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, any modification of our existing fee arrangements or the fee structures for new funds could adversely affect our results of operations.\nInvestors in our funds with commitment-based structures may not satisfy their contractual obligation to fund capital calls when requested by us, which could adversely affect a fund\u2019s operations and performance.\nInvestors in all of our private equity and certain of our credit and real assets funds make capital commitments to those funds that we are entitled to call from those investors at any time during prescribed periods. We depend on fund investors\nfulfilling their commitments when we call capital from them in order for those funds to consummate investments and otherwise pay their obligations when due. Any investor that does not fund a capital call would be subject to several possible penalties, including forfeiting a significant amount of its existing investment in that fund. However, the impact of the penalty is directly correlated to the amount of capital previously invested, and if an investor has invested little or no capital, for instance early in the life of the fund, then the forfeiture penalty may not be as meaningful. If investors were to fail to satisfy a significant amount of capital calls for any particular fund or funds, the operation and performance of those funds could be materially and adversely affected.\nPrior to the receipt of capital contributions from the fund\u2019s investors, most of our funds utilize subscription lines of credit to fund investments and operations. Since interest expense and other costs of borrowings under subscription lines of credit are an expense of the fund, the fund\u2019s net multiple of invested capital may be reduced, as well as the amount of carried interest generated by the fund. Any material reduction in the amount of carried interest generated by a fund will adversely affect our revenues.\nWe may not have sufficient cash to satisfy general partner obligations to return performance fees if and when they are triggered under the governing agreements with our fund investors.\nPerformance fees from our private equity funds and certain of our credit and real assets funds are subject to contingent repayment by the general partner if, upon the final distribution, the relevant fund\u2019s general partner has received cumulative performance fees on individual portfolio investments in excess of the amount of performance fees it would be entitled to from the profits calculated for all portfolio investments in the aggregate. Adverse economic conditions may increase the likelihood of triggering these general partner obligations. The Managing Partners, Contributing Partners and certain other investment professionals have personally guaranteed, subject to certain limitations, these general partner obligations. We may choose to satisfy contingent repayment obligations on behalf of other guarantors who are either unwilling or unable to satisfy their repayment obligations in order to preserve our relationships with our funds\u2019 investors. We have agreed to indemnify the Managing Partners and certain Contributing Partners against all amounts that they pay pursuant to any of these personal guarantees in favor of certain funds that we manage (including costs and expenses related to investigating the basis for or objecting to any claims made in respect of the guarantees) for all interests that the Managing Partners and Contributing Partners have contributed or sold to the Apollo Operating Group. To the extent one or more such general partner obligations were to be triggered, we might not have available cash to repay the performance fees and satisfy such obligations, or if applicable, to reimburse the Managing Partners and certain Contributing Partners for the indemnifiable percentage of amounts that they are required to pay under their guarantees. If we were unable to repay such performance fees, we would be in breach of the relevant governing agreements with our fund investors and could be subject to liability.\nThe historical returns attributable to our funds should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our funds or of our future results or of any returns expected on an investment in our Class A shares and our Preferred shares.\nWe have presented in this report the returns relating to the historical performance of our private equity, credit and real assets funds. The returns are relevant to us primarily insofar as they are indicative of performance fees we have earned in the past and may earn in the future, our reputation and our ability to raise new funds. The returns of the funds we manage are not, however, directly linked to returns on our Class A shares, Series A Preferred shares or Series B Preferred shares. Therefore, you should not conclude that any continued positive performance of the funds we manage will necessarily result in positive returns on an investment in Class A shares or Preferred shares. However, poor performance of the funds we manage will cause a decline in our revenue from such funds, and would therefore have a negative effect on our performance and the value of our Class A shares and our Preferred shares. An investment in our Class A shares or our Preferred shares is not an investment in any of the Apollo funds.\nMoreover, the historical returns of our funds should not be considered indicative of the future returns of such funds or any future funds we may raise, in part because:\n\u2022market conditions during previous periods may have been significantly more favorable for generating positive performance, particularly in our private equity business, than current market conditions or the market conditions we may experience in the future;\n\u2022our private equity funds\u2019 and certain other funds\u2019 rates of return, which are calculated on the basis of net asset value of the funds\u2019 investments, reflect unrealized gains, which may never be realized;\n\u2022our funds\u2019 returns have benefited from investment opportunities and general market conditions that may not repeat themselves, including the availability of debt financing on attractive terms and the availability of distressed debt\nopportunities, and we may not be able to achieve the same returns or secure the same profitable investment opportunities or deploy capital as quickly;\n\u2022the historical returns that we present in this report derive largely from the performance of our existing funds, whereas future fund returns will depend increasingly on the performance of our newer funds or funds not yet formed, which may have little or no realized investment track record and may have lower target returns than our existing funds;\n\u2022the attractive returns of certain of our funds have been driven by the rapid return of invested capital, which has not occurred with respect to all of our funds and we believe is less likely to occur in the future;\n\u2022in recent years, there has been increased competition for investment opportunities resulting from, among other things, the increased amount of capital invested in private equity funds and high liquidity in debt markets;\n\u2022our newly established funds may generate lower returns during the period that they take to deploy their capital; and\n\u2022we expect to create new funds in the future that reflect a different asset mix, investment strategy, and/or geographic and industry exposure, as well as target returns and economic terms, compared to our current funds, and any such new funds could have different returns from our existing or previous funds and different degrees of success on investments or their ability to raise capital.\nIt is customary in our industry for both fund managers and investors in private funds to measure performance of private funds using an IRR, including for purposes of managing private fund performance relative to the performance of public indices over a comparable time period. For example, we disclose herein the IRR of certain of our managed funds' performance using a gross IRR and a net IRR calculation. The IRR of our funds has historically varied greatly from fund to fund. Accordingly, you should realize that the IRR going forward for any current or future fund may vary considerably from the historical IRR generated by any particular fund, or for our funds as a whole. Future returns will also be affected by the risks described elsewhere in this report and risks of the industries and businesses in which a particular fund invests. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-The Historical Investment Performance of Our Funds.\u201d Moreover, while IRR is a widely-used metric to measure performance, it is not the only metric to measure performance. Certain industry participants may instead calculate performance of private funds using a multiple of invested capital or multiple of committed capital calculation and we frequently provide the investors in our managed funds with performance information regarding such funds that is calculated using a multiple of invested capital or multiple of committed capital calculation, on both a gross and net basis. Investors should not rely on any single performance metric to measure the performance of private funds. No assurance is given that IRR is the most accurate or preeminent method to measure performance of private funds, including our managed funds, or that if a different performance methodology is developed or becomes widely utilized, that the use of such other performance methodology would not have an adverse effect on our ability to raise capital for our managed funds.\nOur funds\u2019 reported net asset values, rates of return and the performance fees we receive are subject to a number of factors beyond our control and are based in large part upon estimates of the fair value of our funds\u2019 investments, which are based on subjective standards that may prove to be incorrect.\nA significant amount of investments held by our funds are illiquid and thus have no readily ascertainable market prices. We value these investments based on our estimate of their fair value as of the date of determination. We estimate the fair value of our funds\u2019 investments based on third-party models, or models developed by us, which include discounted cash flow analyses and other techniques and may be based, at least in part, on independently sourced market parameters. The material estimates and assumptions used in these models include the timing and expected amount of cash flows, the appropriateness of discount rates used, and, in some cases, the ability to execute, the timing of and the estimated proceeds from expected financings. The actual results related to any particular investment often vary materially as a result of the inaccuracy of these estimates and assumptions.\nIn addition, because many of the illiquid investments held by our funds are in industries or sectors that are unstable, in distress, or undergoing some uncertainty, such investments are subject to rapid changes in value caused by sudden company-specific or industry-wide developments.\nWe include the fair value of illiquid assets in the calculations of net asset values, returns of our funds and our AUM. Furthermore, we recognize performance fees based in part on these estimated fair values. Because these valuations are inherently uncertain, they may fluctuate greatly from period to period. Also, they may vary greatly from the prices that would\nbe obtained if the assets were to be liquidated on the date of the valuation and often do vary greatly from the prices our funds eventually realize. See note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for more detail.\nIn addition, the values of our funds\u2019 investments in publicly traded assets are subject to significant volatility due to a number of factors beyond our control. These include actual or anticipated fluctuations in the quarterly and annual results of these companies or other companies in their industries, market perceptions concerning the availability of additional securities for sale, general economic, social or political developments, changes in industry conditions or government regulations, changes in management or capital structure and significant acquisitions and dispositions. Because the market prices of these securities can be volatile, the valuation of these assets may change from period to period, and the valuation for any particular period may not be realized at the time of disposition. In addition, because our private equity funds often hold very large amounts of the securities of their portfolio companies, the disposition of these securities often takes place over a long period of time, which can further expose us to volatility risk. Even if our funds hold a quantity of public securities that may be difficult to sell in a single transaction, we do not discount the market price of the security for purposes of our valuations.\nIf a fund realizes value on an investment that is significantly lower than the value at which it was reflected in a fund\u2019s net asset values, the fund would suffer losses. This could in turn lead to a decline in our management fees and a loss equal to the portion of the performance fees reported in prior periods that was not actually realized upon disposition. These effects could become applicable to a large number of our funds\u2019 investments if our funds\u2019 current valuations differ from future valuations due to market developments or other factors that are beyond our control. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Segment Analysis\u201d for information related to fund activity that is no longer consolidated. If asset values turn out to be materially different than values reflected in fund net asset values, fund investors could lose confidence which could, in turn, result in redemptions from our funds that permit redemptions or difficulties in raising additional capital.\nChanges to the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) or the selection of a replacement for LIBOR may affect the value of investments held by or due to our funds and could affect our results of operations and financial results.\nAs a result of the expected discontinuation of certain unsecured benchmark interest rates, including LIBOR and other Interbank Offered Rates (\u201cIBORs\u201d), regulators and market participants in various jurisdictions have been working to identify alternative reference rates that are compliant with the International Organization of Securities Commission\u2019s standards for transaction-based benchmarks. In the U.S., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the \u201cARRC\u201d), a group of market and official sector participants, identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its recommended alternative benchmark rate. Other alternative reference rates have been recommended in other jurisdictions. On December 4, 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration (\u201cIBA\u201d) published its consultation on its intention to cease the publication of LIBOR settings: on December 31, 2021 for all settings of GBP, EUR, JPY and CHF LIBOR and lesser used settings of USD LIBOR and on June 30, 2023 for the more commonly used settings of USD LIBOR. Moreover, on November 30, 2020, U.S. banking regulators issued a statement to encourage banks to stop entering into new USD LIBOR contracts \u201cas soon as practicable,\u201d and by no later than December 31, 2021.\nA large number of IBOR-referenced contracts are held by or due to us or our funds. Furthermore, a significant number of our funds\u2019 portfolio companies are borrowers of LIBOR-linked debt obligations, such as LIBOR-based credit agreements and floating rate notes. To manage the risks associated with the transition from LIBOR and other benchmarks, Apollo has established a Firmwide LIBOR Transition program that is overseen by Apollo\u2019s senior management. As part of this program, Apollo monitors risks associated with the expected discontinuation or unavailability of LIBOR and other benchmarks. The program is structured to address Apollo\u2019s industry and regulatory engagement, financial contract changes, internal and external communications, technology and operations modifications, and program strategy and governance. Apollo continues to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the market and industry transition to alternative reference rates. There is no guarantee that the transition from LIBOR and other benchmarks will not result in financial market disruptions, significant increases or volatility in risk-free benchmark rates or borrowing costs to borrowers, which could have a direct or indirect adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and share price.\nThe investment management business is intensely competitive, which could have a material adverse impact on us.\nThe investment management business is intensely competitive. We face competition both in the pursuit of outside investors for our funds and in acquiring investments in attractive portfolio companies and making other investments. It is possible that it will become increasingly difficult for our funds to raise capital as funds compete for investments from a limited number of qualified investors.\nCompetition among funds is based on a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022investment performance;\n\u2022investor liquidity and willingness to invest;\n\u2022investor perception of investment managers\u2019 drive, focus and alignment of interest;\n\u2022quality of service provided to and duration of relationship with investors;\n\u2022business reputation; and\n\u2022the level of fees and expenses charged for services.\nWe compete in all aspects of our businesses with a large number of investment management firms, private equity, credit and real assets fund sponsors and other financial institutions. A number of factors serve to increase our competitive risks:\n\u2022fund investors may develop concerns that we will allow a business to grow to the detriment of its performance;\n\u2022investors may reduce their investments in our funds or not make additional investments in our funds based upon current market conditions, their available capital or their perception of the health of our businesses;\n\u2022the attractiveness of our funds relative to investments in other investment products could change depending on economic and market conditions;\n\u2022some of our competitors have greater capital, lower targeted returns or greater sector or investment strategy-specific expertise than we do, which creates competitive disadvantages with respect to investment opportunities;\n\u2022some of our competitors may also have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us, which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to investment opportunities;\n\u2022some of our competitors may have a more established presence or greater experience and expertise in geographic regions or business areas in which we intend to expand;\n\u2022some of our funds may not perform as well as competitors\u2019 funds or other available investment products;\n\u2022our funds\u2019 competitors that are corporate buyers may be able to achieve synergistic cost savings in respect of an investment, which may provide them with a competitive advantage in bidding for an investment;\n\u2022some of our competitors have higher risk tolerances, different risk assessments or lower return thresholds, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and to bid more aggressively than us for investments;\n\u2022our competitors have instituted or may institute low cost, high speed financial applications and services based on artificial intelligence and new competitors may enter the investment management space using new investment platforms based on artificial intelligence;\n\u2022developments in financial technology (or fintech), such as a distributed ledger technology (or blockchain), have the potential to disrupt the financial industry and change the way financial institutions, as well as investment managers, do business, and could exacerbate these competitive pressures;\n\u2022some fund investors may prefer to invest with an investment manager that is not publicly traded;\n\u2022the proliferation of SPACs entering the market may compete with our funds for investment opportunities and drive up asset prices;\n\u2022the successful efforts of new entrants into our various businesses, including former \u201cstar\u201d portfolio managers at large diversified financial institutions as well as such institutions themselves, may result in increased competition;\n\u2022there are relatively few barriers to entry impeding other alternative investment management firms from implementing an integrated platform similar to ours or the strategies that we deploy at our funds, such as distressed investing, which we believe are competitive strengths of ours; and\n\u2022other industry participants continuously seek to recruit our investment professionals away from us.\nThese and other factors could reduce our earnings and revenues and have a material adverse effect on our businesses. In addition, if we are forced to compete with other alternative investment managers on the basis of price, we may not be able to maintain our current management fee and performance fees structures. We have historically competed primarily on the performance of our funds, and not on the level of our management fees or performance fees relative to those of our competitors. However, there is a risk that management fees and performance fees in the alternative investment management industry will decline, without regard to the historical performance of a manager. Management fee or performance fee reductions on existing or future funds, without corresponding decreases in our cost structure, would adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nMany of our funds invest in relatively high-risk, illiquid assets and we may fail to realize any profits from these assets for a considerable period of time or lose some or all of the principal amount we invest in these assets.\nMany of our funds invest in securities that are not publicly traded. In many cases, our funds may be prohibited by contract or by applicable securities laws from selling such securities for a period of time. Our funds will generally not be able to sell these securities publicly unless their sale is registered under applicable securities laws, or unless an exemption from such registration requirements is available. The ability of many of our funds, particularly our private equity funds, to dispose of investments is heavily dependent on the public equity markets, inasmuch as the ability to realize value from an investment may depend upon the ability to complete an IPO of the portfolio company in which such investment is held. Furthermore, large holdings even of publicly traded equity securities can often be disposed of only over a substantial period of time, exposing the investment returns to risks of downward movement in market prices during the disposition period. Moreover, because the investment strategy of many of our funds often entails our having representation on public portfolio company boards, our funds may be restricted in their ability to affect such sales during certain time periods. Accordingly, our funds may be forced, under certain conditions, to sell securities at a loss.\nDependence on significant leverage in investments by our funds could adversely affect our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on those investments.\nBecause certain of our funds\u2019 investments rely heavily on the use of leverage, our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on investments will depend on our continued ability to access sufficient sources of indebtedness at attractive rates. For example, in many of our private equity fund investments, indebtedness may constitute 70% or more of a portfolio company\u2019s total debt and equity capitalization, including debt that may be incurred in connection with the investment, and a portfolio company\u2019s leverage may increase as a result of recapitalization transactions subsequent to the company\u2019s acquisition by a private equity fund. Additionally, our private equity funds sometimes finance their equity contributions in a portfolio company through loans secured by all or part of such equity, further raising the significance of debt financing. The absence of available sources of senior debt financing for extended periods of time could therefore materially and adversely affect our funds. An increase in either the general levels of interest rates or in the risk spread demanded by sources of indebtedness would make it more expensive to finance those investments. Increases in interest rates could also make it more difficult to locate and consummate private equity investments because other potential buyers, including operating companies acting as strategic buyers, may be able to bid for an asset at a higher price due to a lower overall cost of capital. Conversely, certain of the strategies pursued by funds we manage benefit from higher interest rates, and a sustained low interest rate environment may negatively impact expected returns for these funds. The TCJA also introduced a new limitation on the deductibility of interest for U.S. federal income tax purposes for corporations and pass-through entities. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, taxpayers may no longer deduct business interest expense in excess of the sum of (i) business interest income and (ii) 30% of \u201cadjusted taxable income\u201d (which is similar to EBITDA for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2022, and similar to EBIT for taxable years beginning thereafter). Although the impact of this limitation will vary across our funds\u2019 portfolio companies, it is possible that we may not be able to utilize the same amount of leverage to finance investments going forward or that a material amount of interest expense may not be deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes by our funds\u2019 portfolio companies, both of which may have a material impact on our rates of return on investments. See \u201c-Risks Related to Taxation-Comprehensive U.S. federal income tax legislation became effective in 2018, which may adversely affect us.\u201d\nIn addition, a portion of the indebtedness used to finance certain of our fund investments often includes high-yield debt securities. Availability of capital from the high-yield debt markets is subject to significant volatility, and there may be times when we might not be able to access those markets at attractive rates, or at all. To the extent that there are limits the amount or cost of financing our funds are able to obtain, the returns on our funds\u2019 investments may suffer.\nInvestments in highly leveraged entities are inherently more sensitive to declines in revenues, increases in expenses and interest rates and adverse economic, market and industry developments. The incurrence of a significant amount of indebtedness by an entity could, among other things:\n\u2022give rise to an obligation to make mandatory prepayments of debt using excess cash flow, which might limit the entity\u2019s ability to respond to changing industry conditions to the extent additional cash is needed for the response, to make unplanned but necessary capital expenditures or to take advantage of growth opportunities;\n\u2022allow even moderate reductions in operating cash flow to render it unable to service its indebtedness, leading to a bankruptcy or other reorganization of the entity and a loss of part or all of the equity investment in it;\n\u2022limit the entity\u2019s ability to adjust to changing market conditions, thereby placing it at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors who have relatively less debt;\n\u2022limit the entity\u2019s ability to engage in strategic acquisitions that might be necessary to generate attractive returns or further growth; and\n\u2022limit the entity\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing or increase the cost of obtaining such financing, including for capital expenditures, working capital or general corporate purposes.\nAs a result, the risk of loss associated with a leveraged entity is generally greater than for companies with comparatively less debt. For example, many investments consummated by private equity sponsors during 2005, 2006 and 2007 that utilized significant amounts of leverage subsequently experienced severe economic stress and in certain cases defaulted on their debt obligations due to a decrease in revenues and cash flow precipitated by the economic downturn.\nWhen certain of our funds\u2019 existing portfolio investments reach the point when debt incurred to finance those investments matures in significant amounts and must be either repaid or refinanced, those investments may materially suffer if they have generated insufficient cash flow to repay maturing debt and there is insufficient capacity and availability in the financing markets to permit them to refinance maturing debt on satisfactory terms, or at all. If a limited availability of financing for such purposes were to persist for an extended period of time, when significant amounts of the debt incurred to finance these funds\u2019 existing portfolio investments came due, these funds could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, if such limited availability of financing persists, our funds may also not be able to recoup their investments, as issuers of debt become unable to repay their borrowings.\nIn addition to our private equity funds, many of our other funds may choose to use leverage as part of their respective investment programs and regularly borrow a substantial amount of their capital. The use of leverage poses a significant degree of risk and enhances the possibility of a significant loss in the value of the investment portfolio. Our credit and real assets funds may borrow money from time to time to purchase or carry securities. The interest expense and other costs incurred in connection with such borrowing may not be recovered by appreciation in the securities purchased or carried, and will be lost, and the timing and magnitude of such losses may be accelerated or exacerbated in the event of a decline in the market value of such securities. Gains realized with borrowed funds may cause the fund\u2019s net asset value to increase at a faster rate than would be the case without borrowings. However, if investment results fail to cover the cost of borrowings, the fund\u2019s net asset value could also decrease faster than if there had been no borrowings. The inability to obtain such financing on attractive terms may impact our funds\u2019 ability to achieve targeted rates of return.\nIn addition, under the provisions of the Investment Company Act, as of April 4, 2019, AINV is permitted, as a business development company, to issue senior securities in amounts such that its asset coverage, as defined in the Investment Company Act, equals at least 150% after each issuance of senior securities. Further, AFT and AIF, as registered investment companies, are restricted in the (i) issuance of preferred shares to amounts such that their respective asset coverage (as defined in Section 18 of the Investment Company Act) equals at least 200% after issuance and (ii) incurrence of indebtedness, including through the issuance of debt securities, such that, immediately after issuance the fund will have an asset coverage (as defined in the Investment Company Act) of at least 300%. The ability of AFT and AIF to pay dividends on their common stock may be restricted if the asset coverage of their indebtedness falls below 300% and if the asset coverage on their preferred stock falls below 150%. AINV will be restricted if its asset coverage ratio falls below 150% and any amounts that it uses to service its indebtedness are not available for dividends to its common stockholders. An increase in interest rates could also decrease the value of fixed-rate debt investments that our funds make. Any of the foregoing circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nCertain of our funds may invest in high-yield, below investment grade or unrated debt, or securities of companies that are experiencing significant financial or business difficulties, including companies involved in bankruptcy or other reorganization and liquidation proceedings. Such investments are subject to a greater risk of poor performance or loss.\nCertain of our funds, especially our credit funds, may invest in below investment grade or unrated debt, including corporate loans and bonds, each of which generally involves a higher degree of risk than investment grade rated debt, and may be less liquid. Issuers of high yield or unrated debt may be highly leveraged, and their relatively high debt-to-equity ratios create increased risks that their operations might not generate sufficient cash flow to service their debt obligations. As a result, high yield or unrated debt is often less liquid than investment grade rated debt. Also, investments may be made in loans and other forms of debt that are not marketable securities and therefore are not liquid. In the absence of hedging measures, changes in interest rates generally will also cause the value of debt investments to vary inversely to such changes. The obligor of a debt security or instrument may not be able or willing to pay interest or to repay principal when due in accordance with the terms of the associated agreement and collateral may not be available or sufficient to cover such liabilities. Commercial bank lenders and other creditors may be able to contest payments to the holders of other debt obligations of the same obligor in the event of default under their commercial bank loan agreements. Sub-participation interests in syndicated debt may be subject to certain risks as a result of having no direct contractual relationship with underlying borrowers. Debt securities and instruments may be rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies or unrated and face ongoing uncertainties and exposure to adverse business, financial or economic conditions and the issuer\u2019s failure to make timely interest and principal payments.\nCertain of our funds, especially our credit funds, may invest in business enterprises that are or may become involved in work-outs, liquidations, spin-offs, reorganizations, bankruptcies and similar transactions, and may purchase non-performing loans or other high-risk receivables. An investment in such a business enterprise entails the risk that the transaction in which such business enterprise is involved either will be unsuccessful, will take considerable time or will result in a distribution of cash or a new security the value of which will be less than the purchase price to the fund of the security or other financial instrument in respect of which such distribution is received. In addition, if an anticipated transaction does not in fact occur, the fund may be required to sell its investment at a loss. Investments in troubled companies may also be adversely affected by U.S. federal and state laws relating to, among other things, fraudulent conveyances, voidable preferences, lender liability and a bankruptcy court\u2019s discretionary power to disallow, subordinate or disenfranchise particular claims. Investments in securities and private claims of troubled companies made in connection with an attempt to influence a restructuring proposal or plan of reorganization in a bankruptcy case may also involve substantial litigation. Because there is substantial uncertainty concerning the outcome of transactions involving financially troubled companies, there is a potential risk of loss by a fund of its entire investment in such company. Moreover, a major economic recession could have a materially adverse impact on the value of such securities.\nAdverse publicity and investor perceptions, whether or not based on fundamental analysis, may also decrease the value and liquidity of securities rated below investment grade or otherwise adversely affect our reputation. For example, certain of our funds, especially our credit funds, may receive equity in exchange for debt securities of troubled companies in which they have invested, and thus become equity owners of business enterprises that have not been subject to the same level or kind of due diligence investigation that our funds would typically conduct in connection with an equity investment. This could result in adverse publicity, reputational harm, and possibly control person liability in certain circumstances depending on the size of the funds\u2019 equity stake and other factors.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from funds managed pursuant to management agreements that may be terminated or fund partnership agreements that permit fund investors to request liquidation of investments in our funds.\nThe terms of our funds generally give either the general partner of the fund, the fund\u2019s board of directors or the third-party adviser the right to terminate our investment management agreement with the fund. However, insofar as we control the general partner of our funds that are limited partnerships, the risk of termination of the investment management agreement for such funds is limited, subject to our fiduciary or contractual duties as general partner. This risk is more significant for certain of our funds which have independent boards of directors.\nWith respect to our funds that are subject to the Investment Company Act, following the initial two years of operation, each fund\u2019s investment management agreement must be approved annually by (i) such fund\u2019s board of directors or by the vote of a majority of the funds\u2019 stockholders and (ii) in each case, also by a majority of the independent members of such fund\u2019s board of directors. Each investment management agreement for such funds can also be terminated on not more than 60 days\u2019 notice by the funds\u2019 board of directors or by a vote of a majority of the outstanding shares. Currently, AFT and AIF, each a closed-end management investment company registered under the Investment Company Act, and AINV, a closed-end management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act, are subject to these provisions of the Investment Company Act. We have also been engaged as a sub-advisor for funds that are subject to the Investment Company Act, and those sub-advisory agreements contain, among other things, renewal and termination provisions that are substantially similar to the investment management agreements for each of AFT, AIF and\nAINV. Termination of these agreements would reduce the fees we earn from the relevant funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe governing documents of substantially all of our funds provide that a simple majority-in-interest of a fund\u2019s unaffiliated investors have the right to liquidate that fund for any or no reason, which would cause management fees and performance fees to terminate. Our ability to realize performance fees from such funds also would be adversely affected if we are required to liquidate fund investments at a time when market conditions result in our obtaining less for investments than could be obtained at later times. We do not know whether, and under what circumstances, the investors in our funds are likely to exercise such right.\nIn addition, the management agreements of our funds would terminate if we were to experience a change of control without obtaining fund investor consent. Such a change of control could be deemed to occur in the event our Managing Partners no longer own a controlling interest in us. We cannot be certain that consents required for the assignment of our management agreements will be obtained if such a deemed change of control occurs. Termination of these agreements would affect the fees we earn from the relevant funds and the transaction and advisory fees we earn from the underlying portfolio companies, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur and our funds\u2019 investments in special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, may expose us and our funds to increased risks and liabilities.\nWe and our funds have, and are likely to continue to, sponsor or otherwise make investments in, or facilitate the acquisition of companies by, SPACs. A SPAC is a special purpose vehicle formed for the purpose of raising capital to eventually acquire or merge with an existing business, which results in the existing business becoming the operating business of a public company in an alternative to the traditional initial public offering process. There are a number of risks associated with investing in SPACs, including: (i) because a SPAC is raised without a specifically-identified acquisition target, it may never, or only after an extended period of time, be able to find and execute a suitable business combination, during which period the capital invested in or committed to the SPAC will not be available for other uses; (ii) investments made by us and our funds in a SPAC may be entirely lost, or otherwise decline in value in the case of investments in third-party SPACs, if the SPAC does not execute a business combination during the finite period of time that is permitted for the related SPAC; (iii) SPACs typically invest in single assets and not diversified portfolios, and investments therein are therefore subject to significant concentration risk; (iv) SPACs incur substantial fees, costs and expenses related to their initial public offerings, being a public company and in connection with pursuing a business combination (in some cases, regardless of whether, or when, the SPAC ultimately consummates a transaction); and (v) the use of SPACs as an investment tool has recently become more widespread, and there remains substantial uncertainty regarding the viability of SPAC investing on a large scale, the supply of desirable transactions relative to the pace at which SPACs are currently being formed, potential litigation risks associated with transactions executed by SPACs and whether regulatory, tax or other authorities will implement additional or adverse policies relating to SPACs and SPAC investing. In addition, SPACs can raise capital through offering - and SPAC investors such as us or our funds could ultimately hold in the ultimate target business - common, preferred, equity-linked, debt, private investment in public equity (\u201cPIPE\u201d) or other types of instruments, each of which is subject to the risks associated with such instruments. Furthermore, sponsoring SPACs or otherwise making investments in SPACs increases the likelihood that potential conflicts of interest relating to us and our funds\u2019 investment activities may arise, see \u201c-Our failure to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business.\u201d\nWe have undertaken business initiatives to increase the number and type of investment products we offer to retail investors, which could expose us to new and greater levels of risk.\nAlthough retail investors have been part of our historic distribution efforts, we have undertaken business initiatives to increase the number and type of investment products we may offer to such investors. Our initiatives to access retail investors entail the investment of resources and our objectives may not be fully realized.\nMoreover, accessing retail investors and selling retail directed products exposes us to new and greater levels of risk, including heightened litigation and regulatory enforcement risks. To the extent we distribute retail products through new channels, including through unaffiliated firms, we may not be able to effectively monitor or control the manner of their distribution, which could result in litigation against us, including with respect to, among other things, claims that products distributed through such channels are distributed to customers for whom they are unsuitable or distributed in any other inappropriate manner. Although we seek to ensure through due diligence and onboarding procedures that the channels through which retail investors access our investment products conduct themselves responsibly, to the extent that our investment products are being distributed through third parties, we are exposed to reputational damage and possible legal liability to the\nextent such third parties improperly sell our products to investors. Similarly, the hiring of employees to oversee independent advisors and brokers presents risks if they fail to follow training, review and supervisory procedures. In addition, the distribution of retail products through new channels whether directly or through market intermediaries could expose us to additional regulatory risk in the form of allegations of improper conduct and/or actions by state and federal regulators against us with respect to, among other things, product suitability, conflicts of interest and the adequacy of disclosure to customers to whom our products are distributed through those channels.\nCertain of our funds utilize special situation and distressed debt investment strategies that involve significant risks.\nOur funds often invest in companies with weak financial conditions, poor operating results, substantial financial needs, negative net worth and/or special competitive or regulatory problems. These funds also invest in companies that are or are anticipated to be involved in bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings. In such situations, it may be difficult to obtain full information as to the exact financial and operating conditions of these companies. Additionally, the fair values of such investments are subject to abrupt and erratic market movements and significant price volatility if they are publicly traded securities, and are subject to significant uncertainty in general if they are not publicly traded securities. Furthermore, some of our funds\u2019 distressed investments may not be widely traded or may have no recognized market. A fund\u2019s exposure to such investments may be substantial in relation to the market for those investments, and the assets are likely to be illiquid and difficult to sell or transfer. As a result, it may take a number of years for the market value of such investments to ultimately reflect their intrinsic value as perceived by us, if at all.\nOur distressed investment strategies depend in part on our ability to successfully predict the occurrence of certain corporate events, such as debt and/or equity offerings, restructurings, reorganizations, mergers, takeover offers and other transactions, that we believe will improve the condition of the business. If the corporate event we predict is delayed, changed or never completed, the market price and value of the applicable fund\u2019s investment could decline sharply.\nIn addition, these investments could subject us to certain potential additional liabilities that may exceed the value of our original investment. Under certain circumstances, payments or distributions on certain investments may be reclaimed if any such payment or distribution is later determined to have been a fraudulent conveyance, a preferential payment or similar transaction under applicable bankruptcy and insolvency laws. In addition, under certain circumstances, a lender that has inappropriately exercised control of the management and policies of a debtor may have its claims subordinated or disallowed, or may be found liable for damages suffered by parties as a result of such actions. In the case where the investment in securities of troubled companies is made in connection with an attempt to influence a restructuring proposal or plan of reorganization in bankruptcy, our funds and/or we may become involved in substantial litigation.\nFunds we manage may invest in assets denominated in currencies that differ from the currency in which the fund is denominated.\nWhen our funds invest in assets denominated in currencies that differ from the currency in which the relevant fund is denominated, fluctuations in currency rates could impact fund performance. We also manage a number of funds which are denominated in U.S. Dollars but invest primarily or exclusively in assets denominated in foreign currencies and therefore whose performance can be negatively impacted by strengthening of the U.S. Dollar even if the underlying investments perform well in local currency.\nOur funds may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks, but we can offer no assurance that such strategies will be effective or tax-efficient. If our funds engage in hedging transactions, we may be exposed to additional risks associated with such transactions.\nMany of our funds make investments in companies that we do not control.\nInvestments by many of our funds include debt instruments, equity securities, and other financial instruments of companies that our funds do not control. Such investments may be acquired by our funds through trading activities or through purchases of securities or other financial instruments from the issuer. In addition, in the future, our funds may seek to acquire minority equity interests more frequently and may also dispose of a portion of their majority equity investments in portfolio companies over time in a manner that results in the funds retaining a minority investment. Those investments will be subject to the risk that the company in which the investment is made may make business, financial or management decisions with which we do not agree or that the majority stakeholders or the management of the company may take risks or otherwise act in a manner that does not serve our funds\u2019 interests. If any of the foregoing were to occur, the values of investments by our funds\ncould decrease, we could be exposed to increased legal risk related to compliance failures by such company, and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could suffer as a result.\nOur funds may face risks relating to undiversified investments.\nWhile diversification is generally an objective of many of our funds, we cannot give assurance as to the degree of diversification that will actually be achieved in any fund investments. Because a significant portion or all of a fund\u2019s capital may be invested in a single investment or portfolio company, a loss with respect to such an investment or portfolio company could have a significant adverse impact on such fund\u2019s capital. Accordingly, a lack of diversification on the part of a fund could adversely affect its performance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur funds\u2019 investments in infrastructure assets may expose us and our funds to increased risks and liabilities.\nInvestments in infrastructure assets may expose us and our funds to increased risks and liabilities that are inherent in the ownership of real assets. For example:\n\u2022Ownership of infrastructure assets may also present additional risk of liability for personal and property injury or impose significant operating challenges and costs with respect to, for example, compliance with zoning, environmental, anti-financial fraud or other applicable laws.\n\u2022Infrastructure asset investments may face construction risks including, without limitation: (a) labor disputes, shortages of material and skilled labor, or work stoppages, (b) slower than projected construction progress and the unavailability or late delivery of necessary equipment, (c) less than optimal coordination with public utilities in the relocation of their facilities, (d) adverse weather conditions and unexpected construction conditions, (e) accidents or the breakdown or failure of construction equipment or processes; and (f) catastrophic events such as explosions, fires, terrorist activities and other similar events. These risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses (which may exceed expected or forecasted budgets) and, under certain circumstances, could prevent completion of construction activities once undertaken. Certain infrastructure asset investments may remain in construction phases for a prolonged period and, accordingly, may not be cash generative for a prolonged period. Recourse against the contractor may be subject to liability caps or may be subject to default or insolvency on the part of the contractor.\n\u2022The operation of infrastructure assets is exposed to potential unplanned interruptions caused by significant catastrophic or force majeure events. These risks could, among other effects, adversely impact the cash flows available from investments in infrastructure assets, cause personal injury or loss of life, damage property, or instigate disruptions of service. In addition, the cost of repairing or replacing damaged assets could be considerable. Repeated or prolonged service interruptions may result in permanent loss of customers, litigation, or penalties for regulatory or contractual noncompliance. Force majeure events that are incapable of, or too costly to, cure may also have a permanent adverse effect on an investment.\n\u2022The management of the business or operations of an infrastructure asset may be contracted to a third-party management company unaffiliated with us. Although it would be possible to replace any such operator, the failure of such an operator to adequately perform its duties or to act in ways that are in our or our funds\u2019 best interest, or the breach by an operator of applicable agreements or laws, rules and regulations, could have an adverse effect on the investment\u2019s financial condition or results of operations. Infrastructure investments may involve the subcontracting of design and construction activities in respect of projects, and as a result our investments are subject to the risks that contractual provisions passing liabilities to a subcontractor could be ineffective, the subcontractor fails to perform services which it has agreed to perform and the subcontractor becomes insolvent.\nInfrastructure investments often involve an ongoing commitment to a municipal, state, federal or foreign government or regulatory agencies. The nature of these obligations expose us to a higher level of regulatory oversight than typically imposed on other businesses and may require us to rely on complex government licenses, concessions, leases or contracts, which may be difficult to obtain or maintain. Infrastructure investments may require operators to manage such investments and such operators\u2019 failure to comply with laws, including prohibitions against bribing of government officials, may adversely affect the value of such investments and cause us serious reputational and legal harm. Revenues for such investments may rely on contractual agreements for the provision of services with a limited number of counterparties, and are consequently subject to counterparty default risk. The operations and cash flow of infrastructure investments are also more sensitive to inflation and, in certain cases, commodity price risk. Furthermore, services provided by infrastructure investments may be subject to rate\nregulations by government entities that determine or limit prices that may be charged. Similarly, users of applicable services or government entities in response to such users may react negatively to any adjustments in rates and thus reduce the profitability of such infrastructure investments.\nOur real estate funds are subject to the risks inherent in the ownership and operation of real estate and the construction and development of real estate.\nInvestments in our real estate funds are subject to the risks inherent in the ownership and operation of real estate and real estate-related businesses and assets, including the deterioration of real estate fundamentals. These risks include but are not limited to, those associated with the burdens of ownership of real property, general and local economic conditions, changes in supply of and demand for competing properties in an area (as a result, for instance, of overbuilding), fluctuations in the average occupancy and room rates for hotel properties, operating income, the financial resources of tenants, changes in building, environmental, zoning and other laws, casualty or condemnation losses, energy and supply shortages, various uninsured or uninsurable risks, natural disasters, pandemics, changes in government regulations (such as rent control or eviction moratoria), changes in real property tax rates, changes in income tax rates, changes in interest rates, the reduced availability of mortgage funds which may render the sale or refinancing of properties difficult or impracticable, increased mortgage defaults, increases in borrowing rates, changes to the taxation of business entities and the deductibility of corporate interest expense, negative developments in the economy that depress travel activity, environmental liabilities, contingent liabilities on disposition of assets, acts of god, terrorist attacks, war and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, if our real estate funds acquire direct or indirect interests in undeveloped land or underdeveloped real property, which may often be non-income producing, they will be subject to the risks normally associated with such assets and development activities, including risks relating to the availability and timely receipt of zoning and other regulatory or environmental approvals, the cost and timely completion of construction (including risks beyond the control of our fund, such as weather or labor conditions or material shortages) and the availability of both construction and permanent financing on favorable terms. In addition, our real estate funds may also make investments in residential real estate projects and/or otherwise participate in financing opportunities relating to residential real estate assets or portfolios thereof from time to time, which may be more highly susceptible to adverse changes in prevailing economic and/or market conditions and present additional risks relative to the ownership and operation of commercial real estate assets.\nWe make investments in companies that are based outside of the U.S., which may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in companies that are based in the U.S.\nMany of our investment funds generally invest a significant portion of their assets in the equity, debt, loans or other securities of issuers located outside the U.S. International investments have increased and we expect will continue to increase as a proportion of certain of our funds\u2019 portfolios in the future. Investments in non-U.S. securities involve certain factors not typically associated with investing in U.S. securities, including risks relating to:\n\u2022currency exchange matters, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and costs associated with conversion of investment principal and income from one currency into another,\n\u2022less developed or efficient financial markets than in the U.S., which may lead to potential price volatility and relative illiquidity,\n\u2022the absence of uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards, practices and disclosure requirements and less government supervision and regulation,\n\u2022changes in laws or clarifications to existing laws that could impact our tax treaty positions, which could adversely impact the returns on our investments,\n\u2022a less developed legal or regulatory environment, differences in the legal and regulatory environment or enhanced legal and regulatory compliance,\n\u2022heightened exposure to corruption risk in non-U.S. markets,\n\u2022political hostility to investments by foreign or private equity investors,\n\u2022reliance on a more limited number of commodity inputs, service providers and/or distribution mechanisms,\n\u2022higher rates of inflation,\n\u2022higher transaction costs,\n\u2022difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations,\n\u2022fewer investor protections and less publicly available information in respect of companies in non-U.S. markets,\n\u2022certain economic and political risks, including potential exchange control regulations and restrictions on our non-U.S. investments and repatriation of profits on investments or of capital invested, the risks of political, economic or social instability, the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation and adverse economic and political developments, and\n\u2022the possible imposition of non-U.S. taxes or withholding on income and gains recognized with respect to such securities.\nIn addition, investments in companies that are based outside of the U.S. may be negatively impacted by restrictions on international trade or the recent or potential further imposition of tariffs. See \u201c-Tariffs imposed by the U.S. and potential for retaliatory actions by affected countries may create uncertainty for our funds and our investment strategies and adversely affect the profitability of our funds and us.\u201d\nThere can be no assurance that adverse developments with respect to such risks will not adversely affect our assets that are held in certain countries or the returns from these assets.\nThird-party investors in our funds have the right under certain circumstances to terminate commitment periods or to dissolve the funds, and investors in some of our credit funds may redeem their investments in such funds under certain circumstances at any time, and, under other circumstances, after an initial holding period. These events would lead to a decrease in our revenues, which could be substantial.\nThe governing agreements of certain of our funds allow the investors of those funds to, among other things, (i) terminate the commitment period of the fund in the event that certain \u201ckey persons\u201d fail to devote the requisite time to managing the fund, (ii) (depending on the fund) terminate the commitment period, dissolve the fund or remove the general partner if we, as general partner or manager, or certain \u201ckey persons\u201d engage in certain forms of misconduct, or (iii) dissolve the fund or terminate the commitment period upon the affirmative vote of a specified percentage of limited partner interests entitled to vote. Fund IX, on which our near-to medium-term performance will heavily depend, includes a number of such provisions. HVF I and EPF III and certain other funds have similar provisions. Also, after undergoing the 2007 Reorganization, subsequent to which we deconsolidated certain funds that had historically been consolidated in our financial statements, we amended the governing documents of our funds at that time to provide that a simple majority of a fund\u2019s unaffiliated investors have the right to liquidate that fund. In addition to having a significant negative impact on our revenue, net income and cash flow, the occurrence of such an event with respect to any of our funds would likely result in significant reputational damage to us.\nInvestors in some of our credit funds may also generally redeem their investments on an annual, semiannual or quarterly basis following the expiration of a specified period of time when capital may not be redeemed (typically between one and five years). Fund investors may decide to move their capital away from us to other investments for any number of reasons in addition to poor investment performance. Factors which could result in investors leaving our funds include changes in interest rates that make other investments more attractive, poor investment performance, changes in investor perception regarding our focus or alignment of interest, unhappiness with changes in or broadening of a fund\u2019s investment strategy, changes in our reputation and departures or changes in responsibilities of key investment professionals. In a declining market, the pace of redemptions and consequent reduction in our AUM could accelerate. The decrease in revenues that would result from significant redemptions in these funds could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, revenues, net income and cash flows.\nIn addition, the management agreements of all of our funds would be terminated upon an \u201cassignment,\u201d without the requisite consent, of these agreements, which may be deemed to occur in the event the investment advisers of our funds were to experience a change of control. We cannot be certain that consents required to assign our investment management agreements will be obtained if a change of control occurs. In addition, with respect to our publicly traded closed-end funds, each fund\u2019s investment management agreement must be approved annually by the independent members of such fund\u2019s board of directors and, in certain cases, by its stockholders, as required by law. Termination of these agreements would cause us to lose the fees we earn from such funds.\nOur financial projections for portfolio companies and other fund investments could prove inaccurate.\nOur funds generally establish the capital structure of portfolio companies and certain other fund investments, including real estate investments, on the basis of financial projections for such investments. These projected operating results will normally be based primarily on management judgments. In all cases, projections are only estimates of future results that are based upon assumptions made at the time that the projections are developed. General economic conditions, which are not predictable, along with other factors may cause actual performance to fall short of the financial projections we used to establish a given investment\u2019s capital structure. Because of the leverage we typically employ in our fund investments, this could cause a substantial decrease in the value of the equity holdings of our funds in such investments. The inaccuracy of financial projections could thus cause our funds\u2019 performance to fall short of our expectations.\nOur funds\u2019 performance, and our performance, may be adversely affected by the financial performance of our funds\u2019 portfolio companies and the industries in which our funds invest.\nOur performance and the performance of our private equity funds, as well as many of our credit and real assets funds, are significantly affected by the value of the companies in which our funds have invested. Our funds invest in companies in many different industries, each of which is subject to volatility based upon a variety of factors, including economic and market factors. The credit crisis caused significant fluctuations in the value of securities and other financial instruments held by our funds, and the global economic recession had a significant impact on the performance of the portfolio companies owned by the funds we manage. Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the value of the investments of our funds and the results of our funds\u2019 portfolio companies. Additionally, there remain many obstacles to continued growth in the economy such as global geopolitical events, risks of inflation and high deficit levels for governments in the U.S. and abroad. These factors and other general economic trends may impact the performance of portfolio companies in many industries and in particular, industries that are more impacted by changes in consumer demand, such as the packaging, manufacturing, energy, chemical and refining industries, as well as travel and leisure, gaming, financial services and real estate industries. The performance of our funds, and our performance, may be adversely affected to the extent our fund portfolio companies in these industries experience adverse performance or additional pressure due to downward trends. For example, the performance of certain of the portfolio companies of our funds in the packaging, manufacturing, energy, chemical and refining industries is subject to the cyclical and volatile nature of the supply-demand balance in these industries. These industries historically have experienced alternating periods of capacity shortages leading to tight supply conditions, causing prices and profit margins to increase, followed by periods when substantial capacity is added, resulting in oversupply, declining capacity utilization rates and declining prices and profit margins. In addition to changes in the supply and demand for products, the volatility these industries experience occurs as a result of changes in energy prices, costs of raw materials and changes in various other economic conditions around the world.\nThe performance of certain of the portfolio companies of our funds in the leisure and hospitality industry has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The public concern over the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with a drop in demand for travel and leisure, restrictions on local and international travel, a drastic reduction in airline services and restrictions on immigration, has adversely affected the demand for hospitality services. This consequently has adversely affected the results of operations and financial conditions of such portfolio companies.\nThe performance of our funds\u2019 investments in the commodities markets is also subject to a high degree of business and market risk, as it is substantially dependent upon prevailing prices of oil and natural gas. Certain of our funds have investments in businesses involved in oil and gas exploration and development, which can be a speculative business involving a high degree of risk, including: the volatility of oil and natural gas prices; the use of new technologies; reliance on estimates of oil and gas reserves in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data; and encountering unexpected formations or pressures, premature declines of reservoirs, blow-outs, equipment failures and other accidents in completing wells and otherwise, cratering, sour gas releases, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, adverse weather conditions, pollution, fires, spills and other environmental risks. Prices for oil and natural gas have not fully recovered since their significant decrease in the latter part of 2014 and throughout 2015, and there can be no assurance that prices will fully recover. If prices remain at their current level for an extended period of time, there could be an adverse impact on the performance of certain of our funds, and this impact may be material. These prices are also subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control, such as level of consumer product demand, the refining capacity of oil purchasers, weather conditions, government regulations, the price and availability of alternative fuels, political conditions, foreign supply of such commodities and overall economic conditions. It is common in making investments in the commodities markets to deploy hedging strategies to protect against pricing fluctuations but such strategies may or may not be employed by us or our funds\u2019 portfolio companies, and even when they are employed they may not protect our funds\u2019 investments.\nOur funds\u2019 investments in companies in the financial services sector are subject to a variety of factors, such as market uncertainty, additional government regulations, disclosure requirements, limits on fees, increasing borrowing costs or limits on the terms or availability of credit to such portfolio companies, and other regulatory requirements each of which may impact the conduct of such portfolio companies. Compliance with changing regulatory requirements will likely impose staffing, legal, compliance and other costs and administrative burdens upon our funds\u2019 investments in financial services. Various sectors of the global financial markets have been experiencing an extended period of adverse conditions.\nIn respect of real estate, even though the U.S. residential real estate market remains stable after recovering from a lengthy and deep downturn, various factors could halt or limit a recovery in the housing market and have an adverse effect on the performance of certain of our funds\u2019 investments, including, but not limited to, rising mortgage interest rates, increasing consumer debt and a low level of consumer confidence in the economy and/or the residential real estate market.\nIn addition, our funds\u2019 investments in commercial mortgage loans and other commercial real-estate related loans are subject to risks of delinquency and foreclosure, and risks of loss that are greater than similar risks associated with mortgage loans made on the security of residential properties. If the net operating income of the commercial property is reduced, the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Net operating income of a commercial property can be affected by various factors, such as success of tenant businesses, property management decisions, competition from comparable types of properties and declines in regional or local real estate values and rental or occupancy rates.\nOur credit funds are subject to numerous additional risks.\nOur credit funds are subject to numerous additional risks, including the risks set forth below.\n\u2022Generally, there may be few limitations on the execution of these funds\u2019 investment strategies, which are in many cases subject to the sole discretion of the management company or the general partner of such funds, or there may be numerous investment limitations or restrictions that require monitoring, compliance and maintenance.\n\u2022While we monitor the concentration of the portfolios of our credit funds, concentration in any one borrower or other issuer, product category, industry, region or country may arise from time to time.\n\u2022Given the flexibility and overlapping nature of the mandates and investment strategies of our credit funds, situations arise where certain of these funds hold (including outright positions in issuers and exposure to such issuers derived through any synthetic and/or derivative instrument) in multiple tranches of securities of an issuer (or other interests of an issuer) or multiple funds having interests in the same tranche of an issuer.\n\u2022Certain of these funds may engage in short-selling, which is subject to a theoretically unlimited risk of loss.\n\u2022These funds are exposed to the risk that a counterparty will not settle a transaction in accordance with its terms and conditions because of a dispute over the terms of the contract (whether or not bona fide) or because of a credit or liquidity problem, thus causing the fund to suffer a loss.\n\u2022Credit risk may arise through a default by one of several large institutions that are dependent on one another to meet their respective liquidity or operational needs, so that a default by one institution causes a series of defaults by the other institutions.\n\u2022The efficacy of the investment and trading strategies of certain credit funds may depend largely on the ability to establish and maintain an overall market position in a combination of different financial instruments, which can be difficult to execute.\n\u2022These funds may make investments or hold trading positions in markets that are volatile and which are or may become illiquid.\n\u2022Certain of these funds may seek to originate loans, including, but not limited to, secured and unsecured notes, senior and second lien loans, mezzanine loans, and other similar investments which are or may become illiquid.\n\u2022These funds\u2019 investments are subject to risks relating to investments in commodities, swaps, futures, options and other derivatives, the prices of which are highly volatile and may be subject to a theoretically unlimited risk of loss in certain circumstances.\nFraud and other deceptive practices could harm fund performance and our performance.\nInstances of bribery, fraud and other deceptive practices committed by senior management of portfolio companies in which an Apollo fund invests may undermine our due diligence efforts with respect to such companies, and if such fraud is discovered, negatively affect the valuation of a fund\u2019s investments. Fraud or other deceptive practices by our own employees or advisers could have a similar effect on fund performance and our performance. In addition, when discovered, financial fraud may create legal exposure and may contribute to reputational harm and overall market volatility that can negatively impact an Apollo fund\u2019s investment program. As a result, instances of bribery, fraud and other deceptive practices could result in performance that is poorer than expected.\nContingent liabilities could harm fund performance.\nWe may cause our funds to acquire an investment that is subject to contingent liabilities. Such contingent liabilities could be unknown to us at the time of acquisition or, if they are known to us, we may not accurately assess or protect against the risks that they present. Acquired contingent liabilities could thus result in unforeseen losses for our funds. In addition, in connection with the disposition of an investment in a portfolio company, a fund may be required to make representations about the business and financial affairs of such portfolio company typical of those made in connection with the sale of a business. A fund may also be required to indemnify the purchasers of such investment to the extent that any such representations are inaccurate. These arrangements may result in the incurrence of contingent liabilities by a fund, even after the disposition of an investment. Accordingly, the inaccuracy of representations and warranties made by a fund could harm such fund\u2019s performance.\nOur funds may be forced to dispose of investments at a disadvantageous time.\nOur funds may make investments that they do not advantageously dispose of prior to the date the applicable fund is dissolved, either by expiration of such fund\u2019s term or otherwise. Although we generally expect that investments will be disposed of prior to dissolution or be suitable for in-kind distribution at dissolution, and the general partners of the funds generally have a limited ability to extend the term of the fund with the consent of fund investors or the advisory board of the fund, as applicable, our funds may have to sell, distribute or otherwise dispose of investments at a disadvantageous time as a result of dissolution. This would result in a lower than expected return on the investments and, perhaps, on the fund itself.\nPersonnel Risks\nWe depend on certain key personnel and the loss of their services would have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe success of our businesses depends on the efforts, judgment and personal reputations of our key personnel. Their reputations, expertise in investing, relationships with our fund investors and relationships with members of the business community on whom our funds depend for investment opportunities and financing are each critical elements in operating and expanding our businesses. We believe our performance is strongly correlated to the performance of these individuals. Accordingly, our retention of our key personnel is crucial to our success. Our key personnel may resign, join our competitors or form a competing firm. If our key personnel were to join or form a competitor, some of our fund investors could choose to invest with that competitor, another competitor or not at all, rather than in our funds. The loss of the services of our key personnel would have a material adverse effect on us, including our ability to retain and attract investors and raise new funds, and the performance of our funds. We do not carry any \u201ckey man\u201d insurance that would provide us with proceeds in the event of the death or disability of any of our key personnel. In addition, the loss of two or more of our Managing Partners or certain other key personnel may result in the termination of our role as general partner of certain of our funds and the termination of the commitment periods of certain of our funds. See \u201c-If two or more of our Managing Partners or certain other investment professionals leave our company, the commitment periods of certain of our funds may be terminated, and we may be in default under the governing documents of certain of our funds.\u201d\nIf two or more of our Managing Partners or certain other investment professionals leave our company, the commitment periods of certain of our funds may be terminated, and we may be in default under the governing documents of certain of our funds.\nThe governing agreements of certain of our funds provide that in the event certain \u201ckey persons\u201d (such as two or more of Messrs. Black, Harris and Rowan and/or certain other of our investment professionals) fail to devote the requisite time to our businesses, the commitment period will terminate if a certain percentage in interest of the fund investors do not vote to continue the commitment period, or the commitment period may terminate for a variety of other reasons. This is true for example of\nFund IX. Additionally, the governing agreements of certain of our funds contain \u201ckey person\u201d provisions that could be triggered by virtue of any one of the Managing Partner\u2019s failure to devote the required time to the applicable businesses, coupled with certain other investment professionals specified as \u201ckey persons\u201d in such agreements failing to devote the required amount of their respective time to such businesses. A number of our other funds have similar provisions. In addition to having a significant negative impact on our revenue, net income and cash flow, the occurrence of such an event with respect to any of our funds would likely result in significant reputational damage to us.\nOur ability to retain our investment professionals is critical to our success and our ability to grow depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel.\nOur success depends on our ability to retain our investment professionals and recruit additional qualified personnel. We anticipate that it will be necessary for us to add investment professionals as we pursue our growth strategy. However, we may not succeed in recruiting additional personnel or retaining current personnel, as the market for qualified investment professionals is extremely competitive. Our investment professionals possess substantial experience and expertise in investing, are responsible for locating and executing our funds\u2019 investments, have significant relationships with the institutions that are the source of many of our funds\u2019 investment opportunities, and in certain cases have key relationships with our fund investors. Therefore, if our investment professionals join competitors or form competing companies it could result in the loss of significant investment opportunities and certain existing fund investors. Additionally, recent changes in law in the U.S. and U.K. have increased the tax rate on various income streams used to compensate investment professionals. More specifically, in December 2017, President Trump signed into law Public Law Number 115-97, formerly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTCJA\u201d). The TCJA changed the holding period requirement for investment professionals to receive long-term capital gain treatment on performance fees for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. Beginning in 2018, performance fees attributable to gains with respect to assets held for three years or less are treated as short-term capital gains and taxed at ordinary income rates. There remains uncertainty as to whether these rules may be further modified in the future. States and other jurisdictions in the past have also considered legislation to increase taxes with respect to performance fees. In 2019, Governor Cuomo, as a response to certain aspects of the TCJA, proposed legislation to reform the treatment of incentive income in New York to tax such income at higher rates. Additional details of Governor Cuomo\u2019s proposal remain unclear, and it is uncertain when or whether such legislation would be enacted. Legislation similar to Governor Cuomo\u2019s proposal in New York has been considered in California and Connecticut (and passed in New Jersey although it is not currently effective), where a significant portion of our employees reside and could impact our ability to recruit investment professionals. In addition, the U.K. implemented legislation effective from April 2015 that changed the scope and tax rate for performance fees, particularly for individuals who have immigrated to the U.K., so called \u201cnon-domiciled individuals.\u201d Further, from 2016, legislation that taxes carried interest returns as deemed trading income has come into force affecting certain U.K. based staff who have an interest in funds that have a weighted average holding period of fewer than 40 months. Because a portion of certain investment professionals\u2019 compensation arises from equity interests in our businesses or a right to receive performance fees, the potentially less favorable tax treatment of performance fees in the U.S. or the U.K. could adversely affect our ability to recruit, retain and motivate our current and future investment professionals or require us to alter our approach to compensating investment professionals. Fluctuations in the distributions to investment professionals generated from performance fees could also impair our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nFurthermore, the SEC has proposed mandatory clawback rules that would require listed companies to adopt a clawback policy providing for recovery of incentive-based compensation awarded to executive officers if the company is required to prepare an accounting restatement resulting from material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements. However, these proposals have not yet been finalized and the specific long-term impact on us is not yet clear. There is the potential that new compensation rules will make it more difficult for us to attract and retain investment professionals by capping the amount of variable compensation compared to fixed pay, requiring the deferral of certain types of compensation over time, implementing \u201cclawback\u201d requirements, or making other changes deemed onerous by such investment professionals.\nAmounts earned by our employees who participate in performance fees will vary year-to-year depending on our overall realized performance. As a result, there may be periods when the executive committee of our board of directors determines that allocations of realized performance fees are not sufficient to compensate individuals, which may result in an increase in salary, bonus and benefits, the modification of existing programs or the use of new remuneration programs, which may increase our overall compensation costs. Reductions in performance fee revenues could also make it harder to retain employees and cause employees to seek other employment opportunities.\nThe loss of even a small number of our investment professionals could jeopardize the performance of our funds, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Efforts to retain or attract investment professionals and other personnel may result in significant additional expenses, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe strive to maintain a work environment that promotes our culture of collaboration, motivation and alignment of interests with our fund investors and stockholders. If we do not continue to develop and implement effective processes and tools to manage growth and reinforce this vision, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired, which could negatively affect our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. The long-term effects of an extended remote work environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are unclear and may negatively impact our company culture and the ability of our employees to be connected and productive.\nEmployee misconduct or misconduct by our advisers or third party-service providers could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain investors and by subjecting us to significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.\nOur reputation is critical to maintaining and developing relationships with the investors in our funds, potential fund investors and third parties with whom we do business, and there is a risk that our employees, advisers or third party-service providers could engage, deliberately or recklessly, in misconduct or fraud that creates legal exposure for us and adversely affects our businesses. In recent years, there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud, conflicts of interest or other misconduct by individuals in the financial services industry (including in the workplace via inappropriate or unlawful behavior or actions directed to other employees). Employee misconduct or fraud could include, among other things, binding our funds to transactions that exceed authorized limits or present unacceptable risks and other unauthorized activities or concealing unsuccessful investments (which, in either case, may result in unknown and unmanaged risks or losses), or otherwise charging (or seeking to charge) inappropriate expenses. If an employee were to engage in illegal or suspicious activities, we could be subject to penalties or sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position, investor relationships and ability to attract future investors. For example, we could lose our ability to raise new funds if any of our \u201ccovered persons\u201d is the subject of a criminal, regulatory or court order or other \u201cdisqualifying event.\u201d See \u201c-Extensive regulation of our businesses affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties. The possibility of increased regulatory focus could result in additional burdens on our businesses-Exemptions from certain laws.\u201d Additionally, our current and former employees, consultants or sub-contractors and those of our funds\u2019 portfolio companies becoming subject to allegations of sexual harassment, racial and gender discrimination or other similar misconduct, could, regardless of the ultimate outcome, result in adverse publicity that could significantly harm our and such portfolio company's brand and reputation. Similarly, allegations of employee misconduct could affect our reputation and ability to raise funds even if the allegations pertain to activities not related to our business and/or are proven to be unsubstantiated. Furthermore, our business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to us, our funds and companies in which our funds may invest, as well as trade secrets. If our employees, consultants or sub-contractors were improperly to use or disclose confidential information, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position and current and future business relationships, as well as face potentially significant litigation or investigation. It is not always possible to deter misconduct or fraud by employees or service providers, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases. Misconduct or fraud by our employees, advisers, third-party service providers, or those of our funds\u2019 portfolio companies, or even unsubstantiated allegations, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation and our businesses.\nFraud, payment or solicitation of bribes and other deceptive practices or other misconduct at our funds\u2019 portfolio companies could similarly subject us to liability and reputational damage and also harm our performance. For example, failures by personnel, or individuals acting on behalf, of our funds\u2019 portfolio companies to comply with anti-bribery, sanctions or other legal and regulatory requirements could adversely affect our businesses and reputation. There are a number of grounds upon which such misconduct at a portfolio company could subject us to criminal and/or civil liability, including on the basis of actual knowledge, willful blindness, or control person liability. Such misconduct could also negatively affect the valuation of a fund\u2019s investments.\nOperating Risks\nWe have experienced rapid growth, which may be difficult to sustain and which may place significant demands on our administrative, operational and financial resources.\nOur AUM has grown significantly in the past and we are pursuing further growth in the near future. Our rapid growth has caused, and planned growth, if successful, will continue to cause, significant demands on our legal, regulatory, accounting and operational infrastructure, and increased expenses. The complexity of these demands, and the expense required to address them, is a function not simply of the amount by which our AUM has grown, but also of the growth in the variety, including the differences in strategy among, and complexity of, our different funds. In addition, we are required to continuously develop our systems and infrastructure in response to the increasing complexity of the investment management market and legal, accounting, regulatory and tax developments.\nOur future growth will depend in part on our ability to maintain an operating platform, infrastructure and management system sufficient to address our growth and will require us to incur significant additional expenses and to commit additional senior management and operational resources. As a result, we face significant challenges:\n\u2022in maintaining adequate financial, regulatory and business controls;\n\u2022in implementing new or updated information and financial systems and procedures; and\n\u2022in training, managing and appropriately sizing our work force and other components of our businesses in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nWe may not be able to manage our expanding operations effectively or be able to continue to grow, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and control our expenses.\nA portion of our revenues, earnings and cash flow is highly variable, which may make it difficult for us to achieve steady earnings growth on a quarterly basis, and we do not intend to regularly provide comprehensive earnings guidance, which may cause the price of our Class A shares and our Preferred shares to be volatile.\nA portion of our revenues, earnings and cash flow is highly variable, primarily due to the fact that performance fees from our private equity funds and certain of our credit and real assets funds, which constitutes the largest portion of income from our combined businesses, and the transaction and advisory fees that we receive, can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. In addition, the investment returns of most of our funds are volatile. We may also experience fluctuations in our results from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a number of other factors, including changes in the values of our funds\u2019 investments, changes in the amount of distributions, dividends or interest paid in respect of investments, changes in our operating expenses, the degree to which we encounter competition and general economic and market conditions. Our future results will also be significantly dependent on the success of our larger funds (e.g., Fund VIII and Fund IX), changes in the value of which may result in fluctuations in our results. In addition, performance fees from our private equity funds and certain of our credit and real assets funds is subject to contingent repayment by the general partner if, upon the final distribution, the relevant fund\u2019s general partner has received cumulative performance fees on individual portfolio investments in excess of the amount of performance fees it would be entitled to from the profits calculated for all portfolio investments in the aggregate. See \u201c-Poor performance of the funds we manage would cause a decline in our revenue and results of operations, may obligate us to repay performance fees previously paid to us and would adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future funds.\u201d Such variability may lead to volatility in the trading price of our Class A shares and our Preferred shares and cause our results for a particular period not to be indicative of our performance in a future period. It may be difficult for us to achieve steady growth in earnings and cash flow on a quarterly basis, which could in turn lead to large adverse movements in the price of our Class A shares and our Preferred shares or increased volatility in the price of our Class A shares and our Preferred shares in general.\nThe timing of performance fees generated by our funds is uncertain and will contribute to the volatility of our results. Performance fees depends on our funds\u2019 performance. It takes a substantial period of time to identify attractive investment opportunities, to raise all the funds needed to make an investment and then to realize the cash value or other proceeds of an investment through a sale, public offering, recapitalization or other exit. Even if an investment proves to be profitable, it may be several years before any profits can be realized in cash or other proceeds. We cannot predict when, or if, any realization of investments will occur. Generally, with respect to our private equity funds, although we recognize performance fees on an accrual basis, we receive private equity performance fees payments only upon disposition of an investment by the relevant fund, which contributes to the volatility of our cash flow. If our funds were to have a realization event in a particular quarter or year, it may have a significant impact on our results for that particular quarter or year that may not be replicated in subsequent periods. We recognize revenue on investments in our funds based on our allocable share of realized and unrealized gains (or losses) reported by such funds, and a decline in realized or unrealized gains, or an increase in realized or unrealized losses, would adversely affect our revenue, which could further increase the volatility of our results. With respect to a number of our credit funds, our performance fees are generally paid annually, semi-annually or quarterly, and the varying frequency of these payments will contribute to the volatility of our revenues and cash flow. Furthermore, we earn these performance fees only if the net asset value of a fund has increased or, in the case of certain funds, increased beyond a particular threshold. The general partners of certain of our credit funds accrue certain performance fees when the fair value of investments exceeds the cost basis of the individual investor\u2019s investments in the fund, including any allocable share of expenses incurred in connection with such investment, which is referred to as a \u201chigh water mark.\u201d The general partners for the remainder of our credit funds generally defer such performance fees until the fees are crystallized or are no longer subject to clawback or reversal. For certain performance fee arrangements, high water marks are applied on an individual investor basis. If the high water mark for a particular investor is not surpassed, we would not earn such performance fees with respect to such investor during a particular\nperiod even though such investor had positive returns in such period as a result of losses in prior periods. If such an investor experiences losses, we will not be able to earn such performance fees from such investor until it surpasses the previous high water mark. Such performance fees we earn are therefore dependent on the net asset value of investors\u2019 investments in the fund, which could lead to significant volatility in our results.\nBecause a portion of our revenue, earnings and cash flow can be highly variable from quarter to quarter and year to year, we do not plan to provide any comprehensive guidance regarding our expected quarterly and annual revenues, earnings and cash flow. The lack of comprehensive guidance on a regular and consistent basis may affect the expectations of public market investors and could cause increased volatility in the price of our Class A shares and our Preferred shares.\nWe may not be successful in expanding into new investment strategies, markets and businesses, each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our businesses.\nWe actively consider the opportunistic expansion of our businesses, both geographically and into complementary new investment strategies. We may not be successful in any such attempted expansion. Attempts to expand our businesses involve a number of special risks, including some or all of the following:\n\u2022the diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core businesses;\n\u2022the disruption of our ongoing businesses;\n\u2022entry into markets or businesses in which we may have limited or no experience;\n\u2022increasing demands on our operational systems and infrastructure;\n\u2022potential increase in investor concentration; and\n\u2022the broadening of our geographic footprint, increasing the risks associated with conducting operations in foreign jurisdictions (including regulatory, tax, legal and reputational consequences).\nAdditionally, any expansion of our businesses could result in significant increases in our outstanding indebtedness and debt service requirements, which would increase the risks of investing in our Class A shares and our Preferred shares, and may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe also may not be successful in identifying new investment strategies or geographic markets that increase our profitability, or in identifying and acquiring new businesses that increase our profitability. Because we have not yet identified these potential new investment strategies, geographic markets or businesses, we cannot identify for you all the risks we may face and the potential adverse consequences on us and your investment that may result from our attempted expansion. We also do not know how long it may take for us to expand, if we do so at all. We have also entered into strategic partnerships, separately managed accounts and sub-advisory arrangements, which lack the scale of our traditional funds and are more costly to administer. The prevalence of these accounts may also present conflicts and introduce complexity in the deployment of capital. The executive committee of our board of directors has total discretion, without needing to seek approval from our board of directors or stockholders, to enter into new investment strategies, geographic markets and businesses, other than expansions involving transactions with affiliates which may require board approval.\nWe rely on technology and information systems to conduct our businesses, and any failures or interruptions of these systems could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations. Additionally, we face operational risks in the execution, confirmation or settlement of transactions and our dependence on our third-party providers.\nWe rely on a host of computer software and hardware systems, all of which are vulnerable to an increasing number of data security threats. We further rely on financial, accounting and other data processing systems to mitigate the risk of errors in the execution, confirmation or settlement of transactions. As we depend on third-party service providers for hosting solutions and technologies, a disaster or disruption in the related infrastructure could impair our operations and could impact our reputation, adversely affect our businesses and limit our ability to grow. The materialization of one or more of these risks would likely have a material adverse effect on us.\nReliance on computer hardware and software systems. There has been an increase in the frequency and sophistication of the data security threats we face, with attacks ranging from those common to businesses generally to those that are more advanced and persistent, which may target us because, as an alternative investment management firm, we hold a significant amount of confidential and sensitive information about, among other things, our investors, the portfolio companies of our funds\nand potential fund investments. As a result, we may face a heightened risk of a security breach or disruption with respect to this information resulting from an attack by third parties such as computer hackers, foreign governments or cyber terrorists. For example, we and our employees may be the target of fraudulent emails or other targeted attempts to gain unauthorized access to employee, proprietary or sensitive information. If successful, these types of attacks on our network or other systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, due to, among other things, the loss of employee, investor or proprietary data, interruptions or delays in our business and damage to our reputation.\nAlthough we are not currently aware of any cyberattacks or other incidents that, individually or in the aggregate, have materially affected, or would reasonably be expected to materially affect, our operations or financial condition, there can be no assurance that the various procedures and controls we utilize to mitigate these threats will be sufficient to prevent disruptions to our systems, especially because the cyberattack techniques used change frequently and are not recognized until launched, the full scope of a cyberattack may not be realized until an investigation has been performed and cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. We rely on industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential and proprietary information maintained on our information systems. Although we take protective measures and endeavors to strengthen our computer systems, software, technology assets and networks to prevent and address potential cyberattacks, there can be no assurance that any of these measures prove effective. Moreover, due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our systems, the process of upgrading or patching the Company\u2019s protective measures could itself create a risk of security issues or system disruptions for the Company, as well as for clients who rely upon, or have exposure to, our systems.\nIn addition, the unavailability of the information systems or the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our businesses and could result in decreased performance and increased operating costs, causing our businesses and results of operations to suffer. Any significant interruption or failure of our information systems or any significant breach of security could have a material effect on our businesses and results of operations due to, among other things, the loss of investor or proprietary data, interruptions or delays in our business and damage to our reputation. If our systems are compromised, do not operate properly or are disabled, or we fail to provide the appropriate regulatory or other notifications in a timely manner, we could suffer any one or more of the following: financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to our investment funds, regulatory intervention, litigation or reputational damage. Our funds\u2019 portfolio companies also rely on data processing systems and the secure processing, storage and transmission of information, including payment and health information. A disruption or compromise of these systems could have a material adverse effect on the value of these businesses. Breaches in security could potentially jeopardize our, our employees\u2019 or our fund investors\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our employees\u2019, our fund investors\u2019, our counterparties\u2019 or third parties\u2019 operations, which could result in significant losses, increased costs, disruption of our business, liability to our fund investors and other counterparties, regulatory intervention, litigation or reputational damage.\nThe costs related to data security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. In addition, data security has become a top priority for regulators around the world. For example, one of the 2019 and 2020 examination priorities identified by the SEC\u2019s Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations\u2019 (\u201cOCIE\u201d) was to continue to examine for data security compliance procedures and controls, including testing the implementation of those procedures and controls. Additionally, many jurisdictions in which we operate have laws and regulations relating to data privacy, cybersecurity and protection of personal information, including the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) in the European Union and the Data Protection Act 2018 (\u201cDPA18\u201d) in the United Kingdom, both of which went into effect in May 2018, the Cayman Data Protection Law 2017 that went into effect in September 2019, and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d) that went into effect in January 2020. Some jurisdictions have also enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals, attorneys general, or supervisory authorities of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data. If we fail to comply with the relevant laws and regulations, it could result in regulatory investigations, litigation and penalties, which could lead to negative publicity and may cause our fund investors and clients to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures.\nErrors made in the execution, confirmation or settlement of transactions. We face operational risk from errors made in the execution, confirmation or settlement of transactions. We also face operational risk from transactions not being properly recorded, evaluated or accounted for in our funds. In particular, our credit business is highly dependent on our ability to process and evaluate, on a daily basis, transactions across markets and geographies in a time-sensitive, efficient and accurate manner. New investment products we may introduce could create a significant risk that our existing systems may not be adequate to identify or control the relevant risks in the investment strategies employed by such new investment products. In addition, our and our third party service providers\u2019 information systems and technology might not be able to accommodate our growth, may not be suitable for new products and strategies and may be subject to security risks, and the cost of maintaining such systems\nand technology might increase from its current level. These risks could cause us to suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to our funds, regulatory intervention, litigation and reputational damage.\nDependence on our third-party vendors. We are dependent on an increasingly concentrated group of third-party vendors that we do not control for hosting solutions and technologies. We also rely on third-party service providers for certain aspects of our businesses, including for certain information systems, technology and administration of our funds and compliance matters. A disaster, disruption or compromise in technology or infrastructure that supports our businesses, including a disruption involving electronic communications or other services used by us, our vendors or third parties with whom we conduct business, may have an adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate our businesses without interruption which could have a material adverse effect on us. These risks could increase as vendors increasingly offer cloud-based software services rather than software services that can be operated within our own data centers. We also rely on data processing systems and the secure processing, storage and transmission of information, including payment and health information. A disruption or compromise of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, if we fail to comply with relevant laws and regulations related to the secure processing, storage and transmission of information, it could result in regulatory investigations, litigation and penalties. Our disaster recovery and business continuity programs may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may result from such a disaster or disruption. In addition, insurance and other safeguards might only partially reimburse us for our losses, if at all.\nFailure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks, including personally identifiable and investor information, intellectual property and proprietary business information could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are subject to various risks and costs associated with the collection, handling, storage and transmission of personally identifiable information, including those related to compliance with U.S. and foreign data collection and privacy laws and other contractual obligations, as well as those associated with the compromise of our systems collecting such information. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store a range of data, including our proprietary business information and intellectual property, and personally identifiable information of our employees, our investors and other third parties, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information are critical to our operations. Although we take various measures and have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments to ensure the integrity of our systems and to safeguard against such failures or security breaches, there can be no assurance that these measures and investments will provide protection.\nThese risks are exacerbated by the rapidly increasing volume of highly sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and intellectual property, and personally identifiable information of our employees, our fund investors and other third parties, that we collect and store in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information are critical to our operations.\nOur technology, data and intellectual property and the technology, data and intellectual property of our funds\u2019 portfolio companies are also subject to a heightened risk of theft or compromise to the extent we and our funds\u2019 portfolio companies engage in operations outside the U.S., particularly in those jurisdictions that do not have comparable levels of protection of proprietary information and assets such as intellectual property, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how and customer information and records. In addition, we and our funds\u2019 portfolio companies may be required to forgo protections or rights to technology, data and intellectual property in order to operate in or access markets in a foreign jurisdiction. Any such direct or indirect loss of rights in these assets could have a material adverse consequence on us, our funds and their investments.\nA significant actual or potential theft, loss, corruption, exposure, fraudulent, unauthorized or accidental use or misuse of investor, employee or other personally identifiable or proprietary business data, whether by third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance or otherwise, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or intellectual property or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could result in significant remediation and other costs, fines, litigation and regulatory actions against us by the U.S. federal and state governments, the EU or other jurisdictions, various regulatory organizations or exchanges, or affected individuals, in addition to significant reputational harm.\nMany jurisdictions in which we operate have laws and regulations related to data privacy, cyber security and the protection of personal information, such as the GDPR and the DPA18, both of which came into effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR and the DPA18 have a wide territorial reach and apply to data controllers and data processors which have an establishment in the EU and the U.K., respectively, or which offer goods or services to, or monitor the behavior of, data subjects in the EU and the U.K., respectively. The GDPR and the DPA18 impose stringent operational requirements on data controllers and data processors. These include (i) accountability and transparency obligations which require organizations to\ndemonstrate and record compliance with the GDPR and the DPA18 and to provide detailed information to data subjects regarding the processing of their personal data, (ii) obligations to consider data privacy as any new products or services are developed and to limit the amount of information they collect, process and store, (iii) ensuring and maintaining an appropriate level of security for personal data, and (iv) reporting of breaches to data protection authorities and, in some cases, affected individuals. The GDPR and the DPA18 give strong enforcement powers to data protection authorities in the EU and the U.K. and introduce significant penalties for non-compliance, with fines of up to 4% of total annual worldwide turnover or \u20ac20 million (whichever is higher), depending on the type and severity of the breach. The U.K.\u2019s data protection authority, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (\u201cICO\u201d), has indicated that, following the end of the Brexit transitional period, it will continue to enforce the DPA18 in line with the GDPR. However, we may not be able to anticipate accurately the ways in which the ICO or the courts in the U.K. will apply or interpret the DPA18, or predict and respond to the wider regulatory or legislative developments that may affect our collection, use and processing of personal information in the EU and the U.K. In addition, the Court of Justice of the European Union (\u201cCJEU\u201d) issued a ruling in July 2020 regarding the validity of the primary mechanism we use to safeguard transfers of personal data sent from the EU and the U.K. - namely, the European Commission-approved standard contractual clauses. As a result of the CJEU\u2019s ruling, we may in certain cases be unable to transfer personal information outside the EU and the U.K. without a defined lawful mechanism under the GDPR or the DPA18, and it currently is unclear how data protection authorities, courts and our counterparties will view or enforce such non-compliance.\nJurisdictions throughout the U.S. have begun implementing their own data protection laws. In 2018, California adopted the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020. Like the GDPR and the DPA18, the CCPA broadly defines personal data, has a broad territorial scope and grants California residents extensive rights related to their data, including the right to know how their data is collected, used, shared and sold, and the right to request that their data be permanently deleted. It also imposes obligations on companies to ensure that any data they collect is used, shared and stored with adequate protections. We have to comply with the CCPA because, among other things, we process California individuals\u2019 personal data in our global technology systems. Penalties for non-compliance are substantial. Violations can incur fines on companies of up to $2,500 per violation (and potentially per individual); intentional violations can incur greater fines of up to $7,500 per violation (also potentially per individual). Additionally, the CCPA grants California residents a private right of action to sue if their unencrypted or unredacted personal information is subject to certain security incidents as a result of a business\u2019s failure to implement reasonable security, and provides for statutory damages of between $100 and $750 per consumer per incident.\nNumerous other U.S. states, including New York, where our information system and technology infrastructure is located, have implemented heightened data breach notification laws. The New York Stop Hacks and Improve Electronic Data Security Act (\u201cSHIELD Act\u201d), for example, was passed in July 2019 and imposes strict requirements on companies to ensure, among other things, that they adopt reasonable safeguards to protect consumer data in their possession, including reasonable administrative, technical and physical security safeguards, and that they adequately notify individuals in the event of a data breach or other data incident. Penalties for non-compliance can include fines of up to $250,000 or, in the event that reasonable safeguards were not used to protect consumer data, up to $5,000 per violation.\nLastly, certain jurisdictions in which our funds are organized have implemented data protection laws. In September 2019, the Cayman Islands Data Protection Law, 2017 (\u201cDPL\u201d) came into effect. The DPL, which is based on eight data protection principles that are similar to those contained in other international data protection regimes, is most closely modeled on the GDPR and applies both to organizations with establishments in Cayman as well as those which offer goods or services to, or monitor the behavior of, individuals in Cayman. Like the GDPR, the DPL imposes a range of obligations on organizations, including those relating to the provision of information notices, data subject rights, personal data breaches, accountability and international data transfers. Breaches of the DPL may result in fines of up to $300,000 and, in cases where information is not provided to the data protection authority, imprisonment for a term of up to five years.\nAs data protection laws in the U.S. and throughout the world continue to become more prevalent and robust, the various risks and costs associated with our collection, handling, sharing, storage and transmission of personally identifiable information are increased. Any inability, or perceived inability, to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations, or other legal obligations, even if unfounded, could result in additional cost and liability, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to investors, damage our reputation, result in a loss of a competitive advantage, impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial data, and cause a loss of confidence in our services and financial reporting, which could adversely affect our businesses, revenues, competitive position and investor confidence.\nOur use of leverage to finance our businesses exposes us to substantial risks, which are exacerbated by our funds\u2019 use of leverage to finance investments.\nWe have senior notes, subordinated notes and loans outstanding and an undrawn revolving credit facility described in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements. We may choose to finance our business operations through further borrowings. Our existing and future indebtedness exposes us to the typical risks associated with the use of leverage, including those discussed above under \u201c-Dependence on significant leverage in investments by our funds could adversely affect our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on those investments.\u201d These risks are exacerbated by certain of our funds\u2019 use of leverage to finance investments and, if they were to occur, could cause us to incur additional cash taxes due to limits on interest deductibility or to suffer a decline in the credit ratings assigned to our debt by rating agencies, if any, which might result in an increase in our borrowing costs or result in other material adverse effects on our businesses.\nAs these borrowings, notes and other indebtedness mature (or are otherwise repaid prior to their scheduled maturities), we may be required to either refinance them by entering into new facilities or issuing new notes, which could result in higher borrowing costs, or issuing equity, which would dilute existing stockholders. We could also repay them by using cash on hand or cash from the sale of our assets. We could have difficulty entering into new facilities, issuing new notes or issuing equity in the future on attractive terms, or at all.\nAdditionally, our credit rating outlook suffered a decline in connection with the issuance of our 4.872% Senior Notes due 2029. Our credit rating outlook may not improve or may continue to decline, whether or not we incur additional indebtedness, which, in each case, might result in an increase in our borrowing costs or result in other material adverse effects on our business.\nOur organizational documents do not limit our ability to enter into new lines of businesses, and we may expand into new investment strategies, geographic markets and businesses, each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our businesses.\nWe intend, to the extent that market conditions warrant, to grow our businesses by increasing AUM in existing businesses and expanding into new investment strategies, geographic markets, businesses and distribution channels, including the retail channel. Our organizational documents, however, do not limit us to the investment management business. Accordingly, we may pursue growth through acquisitions of other investment management companies, acquisitions of critical business partners or other strategic initiatives, including entering into new lines of business. For example, in December 2019, we and Athene acquired PK AirFinance, an aircraft lending business, through a transaction in which we acquired the PK AirFinance aircraft lending platform and Athene acquired PK AirFinance\u2019s existing portfolio of loans. In addition, we expect opportunities will arise to acquire other alternative or traditional asset managers. To the extent we make strategic investments or acquisitions, undertake other strategic initiatives or enter into a new line of business, we will face numerous risks and uncertainties, including risks associated with (i) the required investment of capital and other resources, (ii) the possibility that we have insufficient expertise to engage in such activities profitably or without incurring inappropriate amounts of risk, (iii) the diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core businesses, (iv) assumption of liabilities of any acquired business, (v) the disruption of our ongoing businesses, (vi) combining or integrating operational and management systems and controls and (vii) the broadening of our geographic footprint, including the risks associated with conducting operations in foreign jurisdictions. Entry into certain lines of business may subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar, or from which we are currently exempt, and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk. For example, our planned business initiatives include offering additional registered investment products and creating investment products open to retail investors. These products may have different economic structures than our traditional investment funds and may require a different marketing approach. In addition, to the extent we distribute products through new channels, including through unaffiliated firms, we may not be able to effectively monitor or control the manner of their distribution. These activities also will impose additional compliance burdens on us, subject us to enhanced regulatory scrutiny and expose us to greater reputation and litigation risk. Further, these activities may give rise to conflicts of interest, related party transaction risks and may lead to litigation or regulatory scrutiny. If a new business generates insufficient revenues or if we are unable to efficiently manage our expanded operations, our results of operations will be adversely affected. Our strategic initiatives may include joint ventures, in which case we will be subject to additional risks and uncertainties in that we may be dependent upon, and subject to liability, losses or reputational damage relating to, systems, controls and personnel that are not under our control.\nUnderwriting, syndicating and securities placement activities expose us to risks.\nAGS and certain other subsidiaries may act as an underwriter, syndicator or placement agent in securities offerings and it and affiliated entities may act as such in loan syndications. We may incur losses and be subject to reputational harm to the extent that, for any reason, we are unable to sell securities or indebtedness that we purchased or placed as an underwriter, syndicator or placement agent at the anticipated price levels or at all. As an underwriter, syndicator or placement agent, we are also subject to potential liability for material misstatements or omissions in prospectuses and other offering documents relating\nto offerings that we underwrite, syndicate or place. The relationship between Apollo and AGS and other Apollo affiliates engaged in underwriting, syndicating and securities placements, on the one hand, and our funds and/or portfolio companies of our funds on the other hand, gives rise to conflicts of interest which could subject us to damages or reputational harm. See \u201c--Our failure to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest could damage our reputation and adversely affect our businesses--Broker-dealer and other affiliated service providers.\u201d\nThe due diligence process that we undertake in connection with investments by our funds may not reveal all facts that may be relevant in connection with an investment.\nBefore making fund investments, we conduct due diligence that we deem reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to each investment. When conducting due diligence, we may be required to evaluate important and complex issues, including but not limited to those related to business, financial, credit risk, tax, accounting, environmental, legal and regulatory and macroeconomic trends. Outside consultants, legal advisers, accountants and investment banks may be involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of investment. Nevertheless, when conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding an investment, we rely on the resources available to us, including information provided by the target of the investment and, in some circumstances, third-party investigations. The due diligence investigation that we will carry out with respect to any fund investment opportunity may not reveal or highlight all relevant facts (including fraud) or risks that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating such investment opportunity, including past or current violations of law and related legal exposure, and we may not identify or foresee future developments that could have a material adverse effect on an investment (e.g., technological disruption across an industry). Moreover, such an investigation will not necessarily result in the investment being successful. Further, some matters covered by our diligence are continuously evolving and we may not accurately or fully anticipate such evolution in making fund investments.\nRisk management activities may adversely affect the return on our funds\u2019 investments.\nWhen managing our exposure to market risks, we may (on our own behalf or on behalf of our funds) from time to time use forward contracts, options, swaps, caps, collars and floors or pursue other strategies or use other forms of derivative instruments (OTC and otherwise) to limit our exposure to changes in the relative values of investments that may result from market developments, including changes in prevailing interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The scope of risk management activities undertaken by us varies based on the level and volatility of interest rates, prevailing foreign currency exchange rates, the types of investments that are made and other changing market conditions. The use of hedging transactions and other derivative instruments to reduce the effects of a decline in the value of a position does not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the value of the position or prevent losses if the value of the position declines. Such transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the value of a position increases. Moreover, it may not be possible to limit the exposure to a market development that is so generally anticipated that a hedging or other derivative transaction cannot be entered into at an acceptable price. The success of any hedging or other derivative transaction generally will depend on our ability to correctly predict market changes, the degree of correlation between price movements of a derivative instrument and the position being hedged, the creditworthiness of the counterparty and other factors. As a result, while we may enter into such a transaction in order to reduce our exposure to market risks, the transaction may result in poorer overall investment performance than if it had not been executed. Such transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the value of a hedged position increases.\nWhile such hedging arrangements may reduce certain risks, such arrangements themselves may entail certain other risks. These arrangements may require the posting of cash collateral at a time when a fund has insufficient cash or illiquid assets such that the posting of the cash is either impossible or requires the sale of assets at prices that do not reflect their underlying value. Moreover, these hedging arrangements may generate significant transaction costs, including potential tax costs, that reduce the returns generated by a fund. In addition, the expected phase out of LIBOR in the next few years may adversely affect the effectiveness of certain interest rate hedging arrangements and create economic uncertainties in the relevant market. Finally, the new resolution stay rules could adversely impact the exercise of the funds\u2019 contractual rights in the event of an insolvency of a regulated counterparty. Similar developments abroad may indirectly affect our funds as a result of their direct impact on our trading counterparties.\nConflicts of Interest\nOur failure to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest could damage our reputation and adversely affect our businesses.\nAs we have expanded and as we continue to expand the number and scope of our businesses, we increasingly confront potential conflicts of interest relating to our funds\u2019 investment activities. Certain of our funds have overlapping investment\nobjectives, including funds that have different fee structures, and potential conflicts may arise with respect to our decisions regarding how to allocate investment opportunities among those funds. For example, a decision to acquire material non-public information about a company while pursuing an investment opportunity for a particular fund gives rise to a potential conflict of interest when it results in our having to restrict the ability of other funds to take any action. Conflicts of interest may also exist in the valuation of our investments and regarding decisions about the allocation of specific investment opportunities among us and our funds and the allocation of fees and costs among us, our funds and portfolio companies of our funds. In addition, fund investors (or holders of Class A shares or Preferred shares) may perceive conflicts of interest regarding investment decisions for funds in which our Managing Partners, who have and may continue to make significant personal investments in a variety of Apollo funds, are personally invested. Similarly, conflicts of interest may exist with our Class C Stockholder, which is allowed under our organizational documents to manage our actions as it desires, without considering the interests of our shareholders. In addition, conflicts of interest may arise in connection with a general partner\u2019s investment decisions, including regarding the identification, making, management, disposition and, in each case, timing of a fund\u2019s investments, and we may not realize the most tax efficient treatment of our performance fees in all of our funds going forward.\nAllocation of investment opportunities. Certain inherent conflicts of interest arise from the fact that (i) we provide investment management services to more than one fund, (ii) our funds often have one or more overlapping investment strategies, and (iii) we could choose to allocate an investment to more than one fund. Also, the investment strategies employed by us for current and future clients, or on our own behalf, could conflict with each other, and may adversely affect the prices and availability of other securities or instruments held by, or potentially considered for, one or more clients. If participation in specific investment opportunities is appropriate for more than one of our funds, participation in such opportunities will be allocated pursuant to our allocation policies and procedures, which take into account the terms of the relevant partnership or investment management agreement as well as the decisions of our allocations committee. While we have established policies and procedures to guide the determination of such allocations, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in avoiding all conflicts of interest in allocating investment opportunities.\nCertain of the funds we manage also have overlapping investment strategies with other funds we manage that are registered under the Investment Company Act, and the Investment Company Act prohibits registered funds from co-investing with non-registered funds where non-price terms are negotiated (such as financial and negative covenants, guarantees and collateral packages and indemnification provisions), unless an exception or exemption applies. Certain of the funds we manage that are registered under the Investment Company Act, including AINV and certain of its related entities, received an exemptive order from the SEC (the \u201cCo-Investment Order\u201d) (Company Act Release No. 32057) permitting Apollo to negotiate, among other things, these types of provisions for co-investment opportunities that involve the participation of both non-registered and registered funds managed by Apollo. As a result, to the extent specific investment opportunities are appropriate for a non-registered fund and one or more registered funds, in addition to being subject to our allocation policies and procedures, the opportunity will also be subject to the conditions of the Co-Investment Order. There can be no assurance that the Co-Investment Order will facilitate the successful consummation of investment opportunities that Apollo believes are now available to funds it manages as a result of the Co-Investment Order, or that each fund will be able to participate in investment opportunities pursued under the Co-Investment Order that are within its investment objectives.\nIn addition to the potential for conflict among our funds, we face the potential for conflict between us and our funds or clients. These conflicts may include: (i) the allocation of investment opportunities between Apollo and Apollo\u2019s funds; (ii) the allocation of investment opportunities among funds with different performance fee structures, or where our personnel have invested more heavily in one fund than another; and (iii) the determination of what constitutes fund-related expenses and the allocation of such expenses between our advised funds and us.\nOur fund documents typically do not mandate specific allocations with respect to co-investments. The investment advisers of our funds may have an incentive to provide potential co-investment opportunities to certain investors in lieu of others and/or in lieu of an allocation to our funds (including, for example, as part of an investor\u2019s overall strategic relationship with us) if such allocations are expected to generate relatively greater fees or performance allocations to us than would arise if such co-investment opportunities were allocated otherwise. Co-investment arrangements may be structured through one or more of our investment vehicles, and in such circumstances co-investors will generally bear the costs and expenses thereof (which may lead to conflicts of interest regarding the allocation of costs and expenses between such co-investors and investors in our funds). The terms of any such existing and future co-investment vehicles may differ materially, and in some instances may be more favorable to us, than the terms of certain of our funds or prior co-investment vehicles, and such different terms may create an incentive for us to allocate a greater or lesser percentage of an investment opportunity to such co-investment vehicles. There can be no assurance that any conflicts of interest will be resolved in favor of any particular investment funds or investors (including any applicable co-investors).\nThe conflicts of interest stemming from investment allocation decisions are exacerbated by our sponsorship of special purpose acquisition companies (\u201cSPAC\u201d). After a SPAC has completed its initial public offering, it has to complete its initial business combination within a predetermined completion window that customarily ranges from 12 to 27 months. If a SPAC fails to complete a business combination in the prescribed time, the SPAC is required to redeem the shares of its investors while we and our funds, as the SPAC sponsor, would lose our entire investment. In order to protect our capital, our investment professionals may allocate a potential investment to a SPAC as opposed to a different Apollo fund, portfolio company or client, thereby creating a conflict of interest. This conflict of interest will increase as our SPACs get closer to the end of their completion window.\nRestrictions on transactions due to other Apollo businesses. Our funds engage in a broad range of business activities and invest in portfolio companies whose operations may be substantially similar to and/or competitive with the portfolio companies in which our other funds have invested. The performance and operation of such competing businesses could conflict with and adversely affect the performance and operation of our funds\u2019 portfolio companies, and may adversely affect the prices and availability of business opportunities or transactions available to such portfolio companies. In addition, we may give advice, or take action with respect to, the investments of one or more of our funds that may not be given or taken with respect to other of our funds with similar investment programs, objectives or strategies. Accordingly, some of our funds with similar strategies may not hold the same securities or instruments or achieve the same performance. For example, one of our private equity funds could have an interest in pursuing an acquisition, divestiture or other transaction that, in its investment committee\u2019s judgment, could enhance the value of the private equity investment, even though the proposed transaction would subject one or more of our credit fund\u2019s investments to additional or increased risks. We may also advise clients with conflicting investment objectives or strategies. These activities also may adversely affect the prices and availability of other securities or instruments held by, or potentially considered for, one or more funds. We, our funds or our funds\u2019 portfolio companies may also have ongoing relationships with issuers whose securities have been acquired by, or are being considered for investment by us. In addition, a dispute may arise between our funds\u2019 portfolio companies, and if such dispute is not resolved amicably or results in litigation, it could cause significant reputational harm to us, and our fund investors may become dissatisfied with our handling of the dispute.\nInvesting throughout the corporate capital structure. Our funds invest in a broad range of asset classes throughout the corporate capital structure. These investments include investments in corporate loans and debt securities, preferred equity securities and common equity securities. In certain cases, we may manage separate funds that invest in different parts of the same company\u2019s capital structure. For example, our credit funds may invest in different classes of the same company\u2019s debt. In those cases, the interests of our funds may not always be aligned, which could create actual or potential conflicts of interest or the appearance of such conflicts.\nInformation barriers. We currently operate without information barriers that some other investment management firms implement to separate business units and/or to separate persons who make investment decisions from others who might possess material non-public information that could influence such decisions. Our Managing Partners, investment professionals or other employees may acquire confidential or material non-public information and, as a result, they, we and the funds and other clients we manage may be restricted from initiating transactions in certain securities. In an effort to manage possible risks arising from our decision not to implement such screens, we maintain a code of ethics and provide training to relevant personnel. In addition, our compliance department maintains a list of restricted securities with respect to which we may have access to material non-public information and in which our funds may be subject to trading restrictions. In the event that any of our employees obtains such material non-public information, we may be restricted in acquiring or disposing of investments on behalf of our funds, which could impact the returns generated for such funds. Notwithstanding the maintenance of restricted securities lists and other internal controls, it is possible that the internal controls relating to the management of material non-public information could fail and result in us, or one of our investment professionals, buying or selling a security while, at least constructively, in possession of material non-public information. Inadvertent trading on material non-public information could have adverse effects on our reputation, result in the imposition of regulatory or financial sanctions and, as a consequence, negatively impact our ability to provide our investment management services to our funds and clients. While we currently operate without information barriers on an integrated basis, we could be required by certain regulations, or decide that it is advisable, to establish information barriers. In such event, our ability to operate as an integrated platform could also be impaired, which would limit management\u2019s access to our personnel and impair its ability to manage our investments. The establishment of such information barriers may also lead to operational disruptions and result in restructuring costs, including costs related to hiring additional personnel as existing investment professionals are allocated to either side of such barriers, which may adversely affect our business.\nBroker-dealer and other affiliated service providers. AGS is an affiliate of ours that is a broker-dealer registered with the SEC and a member of FINRA. AGS principally performs the following services: (i) conducts private placements; (ii)\nprovides services in respect of the underwriting of securities; (iii) provides transaction advisory services, including capital markets advisory and structuring services; (iv) conducts merger and acquisition transactions; and (v) purchases and sells corporate debt securities. AGS\u2019s private placement services include placement of our funds and their portfolio companies, and its underwriting services include syndicating transactions for existing and potential portfolio investments of our funds and their portfolio companies. AGS\u2019s underwriting services are provided to existing and potential portfolio companies of our funds and our funds. Additionally, certain of our affiliates and/or our funds\u2019 portfolio companies are engaged in the loan origination and/or servicing businesses, and may originate, structure, arrange and/or place loans to our funds and our funds\u2019 portfolio companies as well as third parties. For example, Apollo Global Funding, LLC (\u201cAGF\u201d), an affiliate of ours, provides a variety of services with respect to loan instruments, including loans, that are not subject to broker-dealer regulations, such as arranging, structuring and syndicating loans, debt advisory and other similar services. The services provided by AGS and AGF have become increasingly important, given changes in the regulatory framework for banks, and the rise in capital solutions or similar transactions that are directly sourced or originated by us and our funds, without the use of traditional, third party financial intermediaries. While we believe these kinds of transactions are beneficial to our clients and our funds, the functions that AGS and AGF may perform give rise to a number of conflicts of interest. In connection with their services to our funds and fund portfolio companies, such affiliates and/or our funds\u2019 portfolio companies may receive fees from our funds, portfolio companies of our funds and third-party borrowers. For investment opportunities involving corporate loans, or similar instruments, AGF could be engaged by either the participating Apollo funds or the corporate borrower, and arrangements are generally made for AGF to receive its fees directly from the corporate borrower for services rendered; however, it is possible that the corporate borrower does not pay for its expenses, in which case such expenses will be borne by our funds as an operating expense. Consequently, our relationship with these entities may give rise to conflicts of interest between (i) us and portfolio companies of our funds and/or (ii) us and our funds.\nPotential conflicts of interest with our Managing Partners or our directors. Pursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, an independent committee of our board of directors, designated by the executive committee of our board of directors, should resolve any conflict of interest issue involving a director, the Chief Executive Officer or any other senior managing director of our company. Other than as provided in the non-competition, non-solicitation and confidentiality obligations contained in our Managing Partners\u2019 employment agreements with the Company, which may not be enforceable or may involve costly litigation, our Managing Partners are not prohibited from engaging in other businesses or activities, including those that might be in direct competition with us. However, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics contains a conflicts of interest policy that prohibits our directors and officers from engaging in any activity, practice, or act which conflicts with, or appears to conflict with, our interests without approval by the executive committee, the audit committee, the conflicts committee of our board of directors or other appropriate committee of our board of directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is possible that potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to investor dissatisfaction or litigation or regulatory enforcement actions.\nOur Managing Partners have established family offices to provide investment advisory, accounting, administrative and other services to their respective family accounts (including certain charitable accounts) in connection with their personal investment activities unrelated to their investments in Apollo entities. The investment activities of the family offices, and the involvement of the Managing Partners in these activities give rise to potential conflicts between the personal financial interests of the Managing Partners and the interests of us, any of our subsidiaries or any stockholder other than a Managing Partner.\nPotential conflicts of interest with our Class C Stockholder. Our Class C Stockholder, AGM Management, LLC, is indirectly owned and controlled by our Managing Partners. As a result, conflicts of interest may arise among the Class C Stockholder and its controlling persons, on the one hand, and us and/or the holders of our Class A shares, on the other hand. See \u201c-Potential conflicts of interest may arise among the Class C Stockholder and the holders of our Class A shares.\u201d\nPotential performance fee related conflicts with investors in our funds. Under amendments to U.S. tax law pursuant to the TCJA, capital gain in respect of a general partner\u2019s distributions of performance fees from certain of our funds will be treated as short-term capital gain unless the fund holds the relevant investment for more than three years, as opposed to the general rule that capital gain from the disposition of investments held for more than one year is treated as long-term capital gain. Similar rules introduced in the U.K. applying to certain U.K. based staff, tax as ordinary income returns from certain funds that have a weighted average holding period of fewer than 40 months (with transitional rules applying between 36-40 months). As a consequence, conflicts of interest may arise in connection with a general partner\u2019s investment decisions, including regarding the identification, making, management, disposition and, in each case, timing of a fund\u2019s investments, and we may not realize the most tax efficient treatment of our performance fees in all of our funds going forward.\nUse of Structured Finance Arrangements. From time to time, we finance, securitize or employ structured finance arrangements in respect of certain of our balance sheet assets. For example, we may establish entities in which we own an equity interest and that are funded in part through financing provided by one or more third parties (\u201cApollo Financing\nPartners\u201d), and such Apollo Financing Partners could hold limited partner interests in our funds or other affiliates. The interest of any Apollo Financing Partners in our funds generally count towards satisfaction of our commitment to such funds, will not be subject to management fees and carried interest in any such fund and may otherwise be entitled to and subject to the same rights and obligations as other limited partners of the funds, including voting rights. We could also employ structured financing arrangements with respect to co-investment interests and investments in other funds made by our entities (including, potentially, co-investments with our funds).\nThese structured financing arrangements could alter our returns and risk exposure with respect to the applicable balance sheet assets as compared to our returns and risk exposure if we held such assets outside of such structured financing arrangements, and could create incentives for us to take actions in respect of such assets that we otherwise would not in the absence of such arrangements or otherwise alter our alignment with investors in such investments. These arrangements could also result in us realizing liquidity with respect to our equity investment in a fund or other entity at a different point in time (including earlier) than the limited partners of such entity.\nIn addition, our funds may, subject to applicable requirements in their governing documents, which may include obtaining advisory board consent, determine to sell a particular portfolio investment into a separate vehicle, which may be managed by us, with different terms (i.e., longer duration) than the fund that originally acquired the portfolio investment, and provide limited partners with the option to monetize their investment with the fund at the time of such sale, or to roll all or a portion of their interest in the portfolio investment into a new vehicle. Under such circumstances, we may invest in or alongside the new vehicle, or hold the entirety of the portfolio investment sold by the fund through or alongside the new vehicle (i.e., in the event that all limited partners elect to monetize their investment at the time of sale to the new vehicle). As a consequence, conflicts of interest my arise across our funds, limited partners, and us.\nUse of subscription line facilities by our funds may give rise to conflicts of interest. Most of our funds obtain subscription line facilities to, among other things, facilitate investments, support ongoing operations and activities of the funds\u2019 and their respective portfolio companies and/or investments, enable the funds to pay management fees, expenses and other liabilities and for any other purpose for which our investment funds can call capital from their respective investors. Subscription line facilities may be entered into on a cross-collateralized basis with the assets of the funds\u2019 parallel funds, certain other funds and their respective alternative investment vehicles, and allow borrowings by portfolio companies or other investment entities. The applicable entities party to the subscription line facility may be held jointly and severally liable for the full amount of the obligations arising out of such facility. If an investment fund obtains a subscription line facility, the fund\u2019s working capital needs will in most instances be satisfied through borrowings by the fund under the subscription line facility, and, less so, by drawdowns of capital contributions by the fund. As a result, capital calls are expected to be conducted in larger amounts on a less frequent basis in order to, among other things, repay borrowings and related interest expenses due under such subscription line facilities.\nWhere an investment fund uses borrowings under a subscription line facility in advance or in lieu of receiving capital contributions from investors to repay any such borrowings and related interest expenses, the use of such facility will result in a different (and perhaps higher) reported internal rate of return than if the facility had not been utilized and instead capital contributions from investors had been contributed at the inception of an investment. This may present conflicts of interest. For example, the interest rate on any borrowings is likely to be less than the rate of the preferred return due to investors under their partnership agreements. Because the preferred return of investment funds typically does not accrue on such borrowings, but rather only accrues on capital contributions when made, the use of such subscription line facilities may reduce or eliminate the preferred return received by the investors and accelerate or increase distributions of performance-based allocation to the relevant general partner. This will provide the general partner with an economic incentive to fund investments through such facilities in lieu of capital contributions. However, since interest expense and other costs of borrowings under subscription lines of credit are an expense of the investment fund, the investment fund\u2019s incurred expenses will be increased, which may reduce the amount of performance fees generated by the fund. Any material reduction in the amount of performance fees generated by a fund will adversely affect our revenues.\nAppropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with one or more potential or actual conflicts of interest. Regulatory scrutiny of, or litigation in connection with, conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our reputation which would materially adversely affect our businesses in a number of ways, including as a result of redemptions by our investors from our funds, an inability to raise additional funds and a reluctance of counterparties to do business with us. See \u201c-Extensive regulation of our businesses affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties. The possibility of increased regulatory focus could result in additional burdens on our businesses.\u201d\nWe have a strategic relationship with Athene and Athora from which we derive a significant contribution to our revenue and that could give rise to real or apparent conflicts of interest.\nWe currently derive a significant contribution to our revenue across our business segments from our investment in and strategic relationship with Athene and Athora. Certain of our subsidiaries receive investment management and advisory fees from Athene or Athora in exchange for a suite of services for their investment portfolios. Through its subsidiaries, Apollo managed or advised $252.9 billion of AUM in accounts owned by or related to Athene and Athora as of December 31, 2020. Our investment management and advisory agreements with Athene and Athora are terminable under certain circumstances. If such investment management and advisory agreements were terminated or fees lowered or changed further it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, Apollo had an approximate 28.5% economic ownership interest in Athene Holding and Athene holds a 6.7% Non-Controlling Interest in the Apollo Operating Group as a result of the Transaction Agreement as of December 31, 2020. Fluctuations in the value of Athene and Athora, including as a result of changes in taxation of Athene introduced by the TCJA, could have an adverse effect on our results and financial condition. See \u201c-Risks Related to Taxation-Comprehensive U.S. federal income tax legislation became effective in 2018, which may adversely affect us.\u201d\nA number of Apollo entities receive management fees and performance fees from Athene and Athora, have investments in Athene and Athora, and manage funds or accounts with investments in Athene and Athora from which performance fees may be earned. Athene and Athora also invest directly in various Apollo-managed funds and entities and we earn fees in respect of such investments. The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of Athene is also an employee of Apollo and six of Athene\u2019s 16 directors are employees of, or consultants to, Apollo. In addition, four of Athora\u2019s 11 directors are employees of, or consultants to, Apollo. These persons have fiduciary duties to Athene and Athora in addition to the duties that they have to Apollo. As a result, there may be real or apparent conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting Apollo, Apollo-managed funds and their portfolio companies and Athene and Athora. In addition, conflicts of interest could arise with respect to transactions involving business dealings between Apollo, Athene and Athora and their respective affiliates.\nWhile we expect our strategic relationships with Athene and Athora to continue for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that the benefit we receive from Athene and Athora will not decline due to a disruption or decline in Athene\u2019s or Athora\u2019s business or a change in our relationship with Athene and Athora, including our investment management agreements with Athene and Athora. Moreover, Athene and Athora are subject to significant regulatory oversight, changes to which may adversely affect either of their performance. We may be unable to replace a decline in the revenue that we derive from our investment in, and strategic relationship with, Athene and Athora on a timely basis or at all if our relationship with Athene and Athora were to change or if Athene or Athora were to experience a material adverse impact to their businesses.\nRisks Related to Regulation and Litigation\nExtensive regulation of our businesses affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties. The possibility of increased regulatory focus could result in additional burdens on our businesses.\nOverview of Our Regulatory Environment. We are subject to extensive regulation, including periodic examinations, by governmental and self-regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world. Many of these regulators, including U.S. and foreign government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the U.S., are empowered to conduct investigations and administrative proceedings that can result in fines, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions, including censure, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or the suspension or expulsion of an investment adviser from registration or memberships. Even if an investigation or proceeding does not result in a sanction or the sanction imposed against us or our personnel by a regulator is small in monetary amount, the adverse publicity relating to the investigation, proceeding or imposition of these sanctions could harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing investors or fail to gain new investors. These requirements imposed by our regulators are designed primarily to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect investors in our funds and may not necessarily be designed to protect our stockholders. Other regulations, such as those promulgated by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (\u201cCFIUS\u201d) and similar foreign direct investment regimes in other jurisdictions, may impair our ability to invest our funds and/or for our funds to realize full value from our investments in certain industries. Consequently, these regulations often limit our activities.\nOur businesses may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the SEC, U.S. Department of Treasury or other U.S. or foreign governmental regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations that\nsupervise the financial markets. We also may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and self-regulatory organizations.\nRegulatory changes in the U.S. could adversely affect our business.\nFederal regulation.\nDodd-Frank Act\nThe Dodd-Frank Act continues to impose significant regulations on almost every aspect of the U.S. financial services industry, including aspects of our businesses and the markets in which we operate. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act includes the following provisions that could have an adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate our businesses.\n\u2022The Dodd-Frank Act established the Financial Stability Oversight Council (\u201cFSOC\u201d), which is comprised of representatives of all the major U.S. financial regulators, to act as the financial system\u2019s systemic risk regulator. FSOC has the authority to designate non-bank financial companies as \u201csystemically important\u201d in certain circumstances, including where material financial distress of the company could pose risk to the financial stability of the U.S. Designation as a systemically important non-bank financial company would subject a company to heightened prudential standards and Federal Reserve regulation. In 2016, the FSOC released an update on its multi-year review of asset management products and activities and created an interagency working group to assess potential risks associated with certain leveraged funds. On December 4, 2019, the FSOC finalized amendments to its interpretive guidance on designating non-bank financial companies as systemically important. The guidance makes it less likely that a non-bank is given a systemically important designation. To date, the FSOC has not designated any investment management firms, including us, as systemically important financial institutions. While we believe it is unlikely that we would be designated as systemically important, if such designation were to occur, we would be subject to significantly increased levels of regulation, including heightened standards relating to capital, leverage, liquidity, risk management, credit exposure reporting and concentration limits, restrictions on acquisitions and being subject to annual stress tests by the Federal Reserve.\n\u2022The Dodd-Frank Act requires many private equity and hedge fund advisers to register with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act, to maintain extensive records and to file reports if deemed necessary for purposes of systemic risk assessment by certain governmental bodies. As described elsewhere in this report, all of the investment advisers of our funds operated in the U.S. are registered as investment advisers either directly or as a \u201crelying adviser\u201d with the SEC.\n\u2022The Dodd-Frank Act amends the Exchange Act to compensate and protect whistleblowers who voluntarily provide original information to the SEC and establishes a fund to be used to pay whistleblowers who will be entitled to receive a payment equal to between 10% and 30% of certain monetary sanctions imposed in a successful government action resulting from the information provided by the whistleblower. A similar whistleblower program was also established with the CFTC under the direction of the Dodd-Frank Act. We expect that these whistleblower programs will result in a significant increase in whistleblower claims across our industry, and investigating such claims could generate significant expenses and take up significant management time, even for frivolous and non-meritorious claims.\nMany of these provisions are subject to further rulemaking and to the discretion of regulatory bodies, such as the FSOC, the Federal Reserve and the SEC. The current administration\u2019s legislative agenda may include certain modifications to the Dodd-Frank Act and other potentially deregulatory measures affecting the financial services industry. For example, in May 2018, President Trump signed into law the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cEGRRCPA\u201d), which amended certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Some of these provisions are subject to further rulemaking and regulatory discretion. The prospects for further legislative reform are uncertain and there is no assurance that such reform will be accomplished by the new Biden administration. As the impact of these rules required by the Dodd-Frank Act and the EGRRCPA will become evident over time, it is not yet possible to predict the ultimate effects that these laws or subsequent implementing regulations and decisions will have on us. Any changes in the regulatory framework applicable to our business may impose additional costs, require attention from our senior management, result in limitations on the conduct of our business, or affect how we compete with other financial services organizations.\nNational Security Investment Clearance Regulations\nCertain investments by our funds that involve a business or real estate connected with, related to, or that implicate, national security or critical infrastructure could be subject to review and approval by CFIUS and/or non-U.S. national security/investment clearance regulators. In the event that CFIUS or another regulator reviews the proposed or existing investments of any of our funds, there can be no assurances that such fund will be able to maintain, or proceed with, such investments on acceptable terms. CFIUS or another regulator may seek to impose limitations or restrictions that prevent our funds from maintaining or pursuing investments, which could adversely affect their performance with respect to such investments (if consummated).\nIn addition, certain of the limited partners in some of our funds are non-U.S. investors, and in the aggregate, may comprise a substantial portion of a fund\u2019s aggregate commitments, which increases both the risk that investments may be subject to review by CFIUS, and the risk that limitations or restrictions will be imposed by CFIUS or other non-U.S. regulators on such fund\u2019s investments. The general partner of each of our funds may take actions to avoid or mitigate restrictions that are imposed by CFIUS or another regulator, such as requiring limited partners to withdraw from a fund or restrict information delivered to limited partners. Additionally, a limited partner in our funds may not be permitted to transfer all or any part of its interest to a person which gives rise to CFIUS or national security considerations with respect to such fund or actual or potential investments. Additionally, our funds may address perceived threats to national security through mitigation measures, including contractual undertakings with the U.S. Government, board resolutions and proxy agreements. The time to negotiate any such measures or the length of the CFIUS review process could place our funds at a competitive disadvantage to U.S. purchasers not subject to CFIUS approval. Such mitigation measures could also effectively impose significant operational restrictions on our funds or their general partners and managers. Should CFIUS approval, or other regulatory approval, be a closing condition to a prospective transaction, there is a risk that such approval might not be granted and our funds will have to bear the costs and expenses relating to such unconsummated investment, in addition to the risk that disadvantageous conditions may be imposed. Similar rules or regulations may exist in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which could similarly adversely affect our funds\u2019 performance. Some of these non-U.S. national security investment clearance rules and regulations have been made more rigorous over the past year, and others, such as the United Kingdom\u2019s National Security and Investment Bill introduced on November 11, 2020, are in the midst of ongoing reform that may establish further restrictions and pose additional risk. Increasingly rigorous national security investment clearance rules and regulations in non-U.S. jurisdictions can result in significant burdens that have little nexus to the relevant transaction jurisdiction. Increased enforcement of foreign direct investment regimes may limit potential buyers in proposed sale transactions by our funds.\nState regulation. A number of our investing activities, such as our lending business, are also subject to regulation by various U.S. state regulators. Moreover, regulations enacted by various U.S. state regulators could impact us indirectly. For example, the State of California has enacted a law that requires California pension plans to disclose fee and expense information in relation to investments in alternative investment vehicles. This new legislation may impact our contractual arrangements with such investors and increase the costs and risks to us in maintaining relationships with such investors.\nIt is impossible to determine the full extent of the impact on us of existing regulation or any other new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed or whether any of the proposals will become law. Any changes in the regulatory framework applicable to our businesses, including the changes described above, may impose additional costs on us, require the attention of our senior management or result in limitations on the manner in which we conduct our business. Moreover, as calls for additional regulation have increased, there may be a related increase in regulatory investigations of the trading and other investment activities of alternative investment management funds, including our funds. Complying with any new laws or regulations could be more difficult and expensive, affect the manner in which we conduct our businesses and adversely affect our profitability.\nRegulatory changes in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. could adversely affect our business. Apollo provides investment management services in various jurisdictions around the world. Investment advisers are subject to extensive regulation not only in the U.S., but also in the other countries in which our investment activities occur. In the U.K., we are subject to regulation by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) and Prudential Regulation Authority. Our other European operations, and our investment activities around the globe, are subject to a variety of regulatory regimes that vary country by country. A failure to comply with the obligations imposed by the regulatory regimes to which we are subject, could result in investigations, sanctions and/or reputational damage.\nEuropean Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom\nThe AIFMD imposes significant regulatory requirements on fund managers operating within and/or from the EEA. The U.K. has on-shored AIFMD and therefore similar requirements continue to apply in the U.K. notwithstanding Brexit. Compliance with the AIFMD has also increased the cost and complexity of raising capital for our funds and consequently may\nalso slow the pace of fundraising. Alternative investment funds (i) organized outside of the EEA and (ii) in which interests are marketed to investors who are registered or domiciled in the EEA are also subject to significant compliance requirements. For example, currently such funds may only be marketed in EEA jurisdictions in compliance with certain requirements under the AIFMD, for example, to register the fund for marketing in each relevant jurisdiction and to undertake periodic investor and regulatory reporting. In some countries, additional obligations are imposed: for example, in Germany, marketing of a non-EEA fund also requires the appointment of one or more depositaries (with cost implications for the fund). In order to manage and market EEA alternative investment funds more broadly for and to EEA investors, two new entities have been created: (i) AIME was incorporated by Apollo in the U.K. on March 31, 2016, and obtained authorization from the FCA on October 28, 2016 to carry out activities regulated by the FCA (including managing and marketing alternative investment funds); and (ii) AIME Lux, a Luxembourg regulated entity, was incorporated by Apollo in Luxembourg on January 2, 2019 and received approval from the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (\u201cCSSF\u201d) to carry out certain activities regulated by the CSSF (including managing and marketing alternative investment funds). AIME and AIME Lux are subject to significant regulatory requirements imposed, inter alia, by the AIFMD (and the on-shored version that applies in the U.K. as outlined below). Some European funds are managed by AIME Lux and marketed by it or its regulated affiliates (to the extent permitted). The European fund structures are subject to ongoing full compliance with all the requirements of the AIFMD, which include (among other things) investor and regulatory disclosures and reporting; satisfying the competent authority of the robustness of internal arrangements with respect to risk management, in particular liquidity risks and additional operational and counterparty risks associated with short selling; the management and disclosure of conflicts of interest; the fair valuation of assets; and the security of depository/custodial arrangements. Additional requirements and restrictions apply where funds invest in an EEA portfolio company, including restrictions that may impose limits on certain investment and realization strategies, such as dividend recapitalizations and reorganizations. Such rules are imposing significant additional costs on the operation of our businesses and our funds\u2019 investments in the EEA and limiting our operating flexibility within the relevant jurisdictions. Further changes to the AIFMD are expected, others are under negotiation, and a wider review is ongoing and the European Commission is undertaking a consultation which may lead to further changes both under the AIFMD and potentially in other areas of EU regulation, possibly leading to increased costs and/or burdens and more limited operational flexibility within the EEA and access to EEA investors. It is not yet clear to what extent the U.K. would track any such changes into its domestic rules.\nOn January 3, 2018, the EU introduced significant changes to the EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Directive 2004/39/EC) (\u201cMiFID\u201d), in the form of the recast Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Directive 2014/65/EU) (which, along with its relevant EU delegated and implementing legislation and guidance, is collectively referred as \u201cMiFID II\u201d). The original MiFID, which came into force in 2007, is the foundational piece of legislation for financial services firms operating in the EU. Many aspects of MiFID II imposed significant new organizational, conduct, governance and reporting requirements, including new requirements around the receipt of inducements and the use of soft dollars / dealing commissions, enhanced transaction reporting and post-trade transparency requirements, formal telephone taping and communication recording requirements, and new best execution rules. Further, the rules in MiFID II may restrict the ability of entities domiciled outside of the EU (known as \u201cthird-country firms\u201d) to provide services to clients domiciled in the EU. MiFID II includes research unbundling rules requiring firms subject to MiFID II to be charged and pay for research independently of dealing commissions. The U.K. has on-shored MiFID and therefore similar requirements continue to apply in the U.K. notwithstanding Brexit. The U.S. SEC has issued temporary no-action relief that, among other things, enables U.S. broker-dealers, on a temporary basis, to receive research payments from money managers in hard dollars without breaching U.S. federal securities laws, where such payment is necessary for the money manager to comply with MiFID II. If such no-action relief is discontinued or withdrawn, this may limit the ability of Apollo\u2019s U.K. MiFID firms or AIME Lux in respect of business that utilizes its MiFID licenses to access research from U.S. broker-dealers. Other changes resulting from MiFID II may have an impact (indirectly) on any entity or client that trades on EU markets or trading venues, or does business with EU-regulated banks or brokers. This may include venue trading requirements for certain categories of shares and derivatives, product banning powers, algorithmic trading restrictions, and enhanced requirements around the provision of direct market access services. Such compliance requirements on our European operations increase our compliance costs. We may be required to invest significant additional management time and resources as market practice relating to the new requirements continues to settle and if additional regulatory guidance is published. Failure to comply with MiFID II and its implementing provisions, as interpreted from time to time, could have a number of serious consequences, including, but not limited to, sanctions from the relevant regulator, inability to access some markets and liquidity sources and a more limited selection of counterparties and providers from which to source services. Sanctions from regulators can include, but are not limited to, public censure (with related reputational damage), significant fines, remediation and withdrawal of license to operate.\nThe European Parliament has adopted the Regulation on OTC Derivatives, Central Counterparties and Trade Repositories, known as \u201cEMIR.\u201d EMIR and the implementing rules thereunder have come into force in stages and implement requirements similar to, but not the same as, those in Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, in particular requiring reporting of most derivative transactions, record keeping, risk mitigation (in particular mandatory initial and variation margin requirements for\nuncleared OTC derivative transactions entered into by certain market participants) and centralized clearing of certain OTC derivative transactions entered into by certain market participants. EMIR impacts (i) Apollo\u2019s European funds and funds managed by Apollo\u2019s AIFMs, and (ii) Apollo\u2019s non-European funds indirectly as a result of EMIR\u2019s impact on many of the Apollo funds\u2019 counterparties to OTC derivatives. As a result of the U.K. leaving the European Union, a substantively similar but not identical set of rules now applies within the U.K. Certain cross-border arrangements (such as those where an Apollo European fund enters into derivatives transactions with a U.K. counterparty, transacts on a U.K. trading venue or clears its derivatives transactions through a clearing house in the U.K.) may be impacted. Compliance with the relevant requirements in the EU and U.K. (as applicable) is likely to continue to increase the burdens and costs of doing business.\nRegulation (EU) 2017/2402 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2017 (the \u201cEU Securitization Regulation\u201d) came into effect January 1, 2019 and established requirements for, among other things, due diligence, risk retention and disclosure regarding certain of our European investments, subsidiaries and CLOs. There is a risk that a non-EU alternative investment fund manager (a fund\u2019s \u201cnon-EU AIFM\u201d), such as the Company, that markets an alternative investment fund in the EU which invests in securitization positions could be caught within scope of certain requirements under the EU Securitization Regulation when investing in such positions. To the extent a non-EU AIFM is within the scope of the EU Securitization Regulation it could only hold a securitization exposure where the originator, sponsor or original lender retains 5% of the securitization. There are certain other requirements with which the non-EU AIFM would also need to comply. The U.K. has on-shored the EU Securitization Regulation and therefore similar requirements continue to apply in the U.K. notwithstanding Brexit.\nThe U.K. has implemented transparency legislation that requires many large businesses to publish their U.K. tax strategies on their websites before the end of each financial year. Apollo\u2019s U.K. business is required to comply with these rules. As part of the requirement, organizations must publish information on tax risk management and governance, tax planning, tax risk appetite and their approach to HMRC. Apollo\u2019s refreshed \u201ctax strategy\u201d is published on our website. Since 2017, the U.K. has a new corporate criminal offense regime for the failure to prevent the facilitation of tax evasion. The scope of the law and guidance is extremely wide and covers tax evasion committed both in the U.K. and abroad and so could have a global impact for Apollo\u2019s businesses. Criminal liability can be mitigated where a relevant business has proportionate policies and procedures in place to manage the risk. These changes illustrate an evolving approach from HMRC and bring tax matters further into the public domain. As such, tax matters may now be seen to pose a greater reputational risk to the business.\nThe EU Council Directive 2018/822 (\u201cDAC 6\u201d) requires mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation in relation to reportable cross-border arrangements. As of July 1, 2020 (or January 1, 2021 for jurisdictions that deferred implementation), taxpayers and their advisers may be required to disclose information to tax authorities when arrangements bearing specific hallmarks involve one or more EU member states. In addition, certain cross-border arrangements put into place between June 25, 2018 and June 30, 2020 were reportable to relevant taxing authorities beginning August 31, 2020 (or February 28, 2021 for jurisdictions which deferred implementation). On December 31, 2020, the U.K. significantly narrowed the scope of arrangements that need to be reported in the U.K. pursuant to DAC 6 and, in due course, intends to repeal DAC 6 and implement reporting under the OECD Mandatory Disclosure Rules. DAC 6 may expose Apollo\u2019s investment activities to increased scrutiny from European tax authorities as a result of the breadth of the disclosure requirements, and Apollo and its advisers will be required to allocate an increased amount of time and resources in order to comply with DAC 6.\nA new EU Regulation on the prudential requirements of investment firms (Regulation (EU) 2019/2033) and its accompanying Directive (Directive (EU) 2019/2034) (together, \u201cIFR/IFD\u201d) have now been finalized and are due to take effect on June 26, 2021. IFR/IFD will introduce a bespoke prudential regime for most MiFID investment firms to replace the one that currently applies under the fourth Capital Requirements Directive (\u201cCRD IV\u201d) and the Capital Requirements Regulation (\u201cCRR\u201d). IFR/IFD represents a complete overhaul of \u201cprudential\u201d regulation in the EU. A version of IFR/IFD is also expected to apply in the U.K. from January 2022. There is a risk that these new regimes will result in higher regulatory capital requirements for affected firms and new, more onerous remuneration rules, as well as re-cut and extended internal governance, disclosure, reporting, liquidity, and group \u201cprudential\u201d consolidation requirements (among other things), each of which could have a material direct or indirect impact on Apollo\u2019s European operations.\nThe new EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2019/2088) contains rules requiring MiFID firms and AIFMs to take into account sustainability and environmental, social and governance factors in their organizational (including remuneration), risk and governance arrangements, and to make certain public disclosures in relation to their approach to those factors. The majority of these requirements are expected to come into effect in the EU (but not the U.K. which is instead expected to implement certain recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures on a longer timescale) on March 10, 2021, and will broadly affect all of Apollo\u2019s EEA operations, including to a certain extent where non-EU funds or other products are provided to clients or investors in the EU. There remain a number of areas of\nuncertainty as to the detail and scope of these rules (especially in relation to requirements driven by delegated acts, which are yet to be finalized), but in particular there is a risk that material, additional data may need to be collected and disclosed (some of which may not be easily obtainable or obtainable at all), which could materially increase the compliance burden and costs for Apollo\u2019s European operations.\nAdditional laws and regulations will come into force in the U.K./EU in coming years. In addition, U.K., pan-EU and European national regulators may also issue extra-statutory guidance and/or thematic work which could indicate new forthcoming rules, or changes to existing rules, impacting the markets in which Apollo operates. These are expected to (or in the case of new guidance, could) have an impact on Apollo including the costs of, risk to and manner of conducting its business; the markets in which Apollo operates; the assets managed or advised by Apollo; Apollo\u2019s ability to raise capital from investors; and ultimately there may be an impact on the returns which can be achieved. Examples include changes to the regime for cross-border distribution of funds in the EU (including in particular changes to the level of \u201cpre-marketing\u201d that is permitted); further requirements relating to the integration of sustainability and environmental, social and governance considerations into firms\u2019 investment processes and disclosures (including under the EU Taxonomy Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2020/852), parts of which come into effect from January 1, 2022 and financial sustainability-driven amendments to AIFMD and MiFID, as well as the separate rules that the U.K. currently intends to implement in this area, including a U.K. equivalent of the EU Taxonomy Regulation); changes to the EU Market Abuse Regulation stemming from a review undertaken by the pan-EU securities regulator; requirements relating to securities financing transactions (including new reporting requirements which are now in effect); further changes to or reviews of the extent and interpretation of pay regulation, including under IFR/IFD (which may have an impact on the retention and recruitment of key personnel); proposals in the U.K. for an economic crime levy to be paid by U.K. licensed firms (and possibly others) to fund enhanced government action to tackle money laundering; proposals for enhanced regulation of loan origination, servicing of credit agreements and the secondary loan markets; and significant focus on entities considered to be \u201cshadow banks.\u201d In the U.K., there have been additional changes to the rules concerning the approval of certain Apollo U.K. professionals to work in the regulated financial services sector. Complying with these new rules (or, in the case of future U.K. legislative or regulatory initiatives, revised or existing rules which diverge from those in force in the EEA) may create additional compliance burden and cost for Apollo. Regulations affecting specific investor types, such as insurance companies, may impact their businesses; their ability to invest and the assets in which they are permitted to invest; and the requirements which their investments place on us, such as extensive disclosure and reporting obligations. The regulation of some institutions has an effect on their ability and willingness to extend credit and the costs of credit. This has, and is likely to continue to have, an impact on the price and availability of credit. Changes to the regulation of benchmarks, including the replacement of LIBOR, may affect the way in which relevant benchmarks are calculated, with commercial and documentary implications for both pre-existing and new arrangements, including on the stability of the benchmark and returns.\nAs a result of Brexit, the legal and regulatory requirements in the U.K. will no longer derive from EU sources. Beginning January 1, 2021, domestic U.K. legislation, including the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020, in effect transposes so-called EU retained law (as it exists on December 31, 2020), which covers significant portions of EU law into domestic legislation for purposes of domestic application. Elements of EU law that apply beyond the U.K., for example passporting rights for financial services, ceased to apply. Separate legislation may replicate significant portions of EU law for domestic purposes. The interpretations of EU retained laws, and related case law, will be within the competence of U.K. courts and tribunals and are likely to raise complex issues.\nRecent changes to regulations regarding derivatives could adversely impact various aspects of our business. Derivatives rules and regulations promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act have become effective over time and comprehensively regulate the \u201cover the counter\u201d (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives markets. The Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder require mandatory clearing and execution on a swap execution facility of certain derivative transactions (including formerly unregulated OTC derivatives). The CFTC currently requires that certain interest rate and credit default index swaps be centrally cleared and executed through a swap execution facility. Additional standardized swap contracts are expected to be subject to the clearing and execution requirements in the future. OTC derivatives submitted for clearing are subject to minimum initial and variation margin requirements set by the relevant clearinghouse, as well as margin requirements imposed by the clearing brokers. For swaps that are cleared through a clearinghouse, transactions are subject to the rules of the clearinghouse and the funds are exposed to clearinghouse performance and credit risks. Clearinghouse collateral requirements may differ from and be greater than the collateral terms negotiated with derivatives counterparties in the OTC market. Such increased collateral requirements may increase a fund\u2019s cost in entering into certain products and impact its ability to pursue certain investment strategies. Moreover, OTC derivative dealers are also required to post margin to the clearinghouses through which their customers\u2019 trades are cleared, instead of using such margin in their operations. This will increase the OTC derivative dealers\u2019 costs and such increased costs are expected to be passed through to other market participants in the form of higher upfront and mark-to-market margin, less favorable trade pricing, and possibly new or increased fees. In addition, our\nderivatives transactions are, under certain circumstances, subject to similar laws and regulations imposed by non-U.S. jurisdictions and regulators, which may further increase such costs.\nOTC trades not cleared through a registered clearinghouse may not be subject to the protections afforded to participants in cleared swaps (for example, centralized counterparty, customer asset segregation and clearinghouse-imposed margin requirements). The CFTC and various prudential regulators have promulgated final rules on margin requirements for uncleared swaps. The final rules generally require banks and dealers, subject to thresholds and certain limited exemptions, to collect and post margin in respect of uncleared swaps. With financial counterparties, variation margin requirements for uncleared swaps became effective in 2017, and initial margin requirements for uncleared swaps are expected to phase in through 2022, depending on the aggregate notional amount of over-the-counter swaps traded by a fund. The SEC has also recently completed its suite of security-based swap rules, including rules regarding segregation, capital and margin requirements. While such rules for security-based swaps are not yet implemented, their effectiveness or phase-in is expected to commence late in calendar year 2021. These rules on margin requirements for uncleared swaps and security-based swaps could adversely affect our businesses, including our ability to enter into such swaps and security-based swaps or our available liquidity. Although the Dodd-Frank Act includes limited exemptions from the clearing and margin requirements for so-called \u201cnon-financial end-users,\u201d our funds and our funds\u2019 portfolio companies may not be able to rely on such exemptions.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also created new categories of regulated market participants, such as \u201cswap-dealers,\u201d \u201csecurity-based swap dealers,\u201d \u201cmajor swap participants\u201d and \u201cmajor security-based swap participants\u201d who are subject to significant capital, registration, recordkeeping, reporting, disclosure, business conduct and other regulatory requirements, which give rise to administrative costs. Even if certain of these requirements are not directly applicable to us, they may still increase our costs of entering into transactions with the parties to whom the requirements are directly applicable.\nPosition limits imposed by various regulators, self-regulatory organizations or trading facilities on derivatives may also limit our ability to effect desired trades. Position limits represent the maximum amounts of net long or net short positions that any one person or entity may own or control in a particular financial instrument. For example, the CFTC, on January 20, 2020, voted to re-propose rules that would establish specific limits on speculative positions in 25 physical commodity futures contracts, futures and options directly or indirectly linked to such contracts as well as economically equivalent swaps. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the SEC to set position limits on security-based swaps. If such proposed rules are adopted, we may be required to aggregate the positions of our various investment funds and the positions of our funds\u2019 portfolio companies. It is possible that trading decisions may have to be modified and that positions held may have to be liquidated in order to avoid exceeding such limits. Such modification or liquidation, if required, could adversely affect our operations and profitability.\nThe Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have issued resolution stay regulations, which came into effect in 2019 and impose requirements on certain financial contracts of global systemically important banking organizations (\u201cG-SIBs\u201d) to expressly recognize limits (such as temporary suspension and removal of consent rights to certain transfers) on the exercise of default remedies by their trading counterparties in the event such G-SIB enters into insolvency proceedings. Regulators in other G20 jurisdictions have implemented, or are in the process of implementing, similar rules regarding the recognition of the application of temporary stay or overrides of certain termination rights under the relevant home-country special resolution regime. These regulations aim to achieve the same policy goal of an orderly resolution of systemically important financial institutions in the event of insolvency. The application of such regulations could adversely impact the exercise of the funds\u2019 contractual rights in the event of an insolvency of a G-SIB trading counterparty.\nRisk retention rules could adversely affect our CLO business. \u201cRisk retention\u201d rules promulgated by U.S. federal regulators under the Dodd-Frank Act require a \u201csecuritizer\u201d or \u201csponsor\u201d of a collateralized loan obligation (\u201cCLO\u201d), to retain at least 5% of the credit risk of the securitized assets, either directly or through a majority-owned affiliate (the \u201cU.S. Risk Retention Rules\u201d). The EU has in place similar 5% risk retention rules (the \u201cEU Risk Retention Rules\u201d) that apply to certain EU investors such as credit institutions (including banks), investment firms, authorized investment fund managers and insurance and reorganization undertakings. Similar risk retention regulations applicable to certain Japanese investors (the \u201cJapanese Risk Retention Rules\u201d, and together with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, the EU Risk Retention Rules and the risk retention regulations of any other jurisdiction, the \u201cRisk Retention Rules\u201d) have been adopted by the Japanese Financial Services Agency. In 2016, we established Redding Ridge, which manages CLOs, for the purpose of facilitating compliance with applicable Risk Retention Rules.\nOn February 9, 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (the \u201cDC Circuit Court\u201d) ruled in favor of an appeal brought by the Loan Syndications and Trading Association (the \u201cLSTA\u201d) from a district court (\u201cDistrict\nCourt\u201d) ruling granting summary judgment to the SEC and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on the issue of whether the U.S. Risk Retention Rules apply to collateral managers of \u201copen market\u201d CLOs under Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the \u201cDC Circuit Court Decision\u201d). The District Court entered summary judgment in favor of the LSTA on April 5, 2018. As of the date hereof, CLO managers of \u201copen-market CLOs\u201d (as defined in the DC Circuit Court Decision) are no longer required to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules.\nThe DC Circuit Court Decision discussed above would not apply with respect to any \u201cbalance sheet CLOs\u201d (such as middle market CLOs) undertaken by us or Redding Ridge which would remain subject to the requirements of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. In addition, the DC Circuit Court Decision would have no applicability with respect to compliance with the EU Risk Retention Rules, which continue to remain in effect, or applicable Risk Retention Rules of any other jurisdiction. Thus, to the extent that we or Redding Ridge were managing a U.S. CLO that was structured to comply with the EU Risk Retention Rules (which is done to expand the potential universe of investors for such U.S. CLO) or a European CLO, then we or Redding Ridge, as applicable, would continue to have to comply with the EU Risk Retention Rules. Risk Retention Rules of other jurisdictions may also apply with respect to certain CLOs or certain investors in CLOs. Finally, the DC Circuit Court decision would not impact any letter or other contractual agreements (\u201cRisk Retention Undertakings\u201d) that we or Redding Ridge may have or will in the future enter into with investors or other third parties designed to ensure such CLOs comply with Risk Retention Rules. Depending on the terms of such Risk Retention Undertakings, there may be an ongoing obligation to continue to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules for some period, which if breached could result in claims by investors or third parties.\nNo assurance can be made that in the future any governmental authority will not take further legislative, regulatory or judicial action with respect to any Risk Retention Rules, including the adoption of new Risk Retention Rules, and the effect of any such action cannot be known or predicted.\nNo assurance can be given as to whether Risk Retention Rules will have a future material adverse effect on our business. Risk Retention Rules also may have an adverse effect on the leveraged loan market generally, which may adversely affect our CLO management business or the CLO management business of Redding Ridge. As a result of the launch of Redding Ridge, it is less likely that we will manage new CLOs.\nExemptions from certain laws. In conducting our activities, we regularly rely on exemptions from various requirements of law or regulation in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, including the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Investment Company Act, the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 and the Employment Retirement Income Securities Act of 1974, each as amended, and the regulations promulgated under each of them. These exemptions are sometimes highly complex.\nIn certain circumstances we depend on compliance by third parties whom we do not control. For example, in raising new funds, we typically rely on Regulation D for exemption from registration under the Security Act, which prohibits issuers (including our funds) from relying on certain of the exemptions from registration if the fund or any of its \u201ccovered persons\u201d (including certain officers and directors, but also including certain third parties including, among others, promoters, placement agents and beneficial owners of 20% of outstanding voting securities of the fund) has been the subject of a \u201cdisqualifying event,\u201d or constitutes a \u201cbad actor,\u201d which can result from a variety of criminal, regulatory and civil matters. If any of the covered persons associated with our funds is subject to a disqualifying event, one or more of our funds could lose the ability to raise capital in a Rule 506 private offering for a significant period of time, which could significantly impair our ability to raise new funds, and, therefore, could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if certain of our employees or any potential significant fund investor has been the subject of a disqualifying event, we could be required to reassign or terminate such an employee or we could be required to refuse the investment of such an investor, which could impair our relationships with investors, harm our reputation, or make it more difficult to raise new funds.\nCertain other exemptions require monitoring of ongoing compliance with the applicable requirements throughout the life of the applicable fund. For example, with respect to certain of our funds we rely on the so-called \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption from commodity pool operator registration, codified in CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3). If any of those funds cease to qualify for this (or another applicable) exemption, certain Apollo entities associated with and/or affiliated with those funds will be required to register with the CFTC as commodity pool operators. This exemption requires that the amount of commodities interest positions in the applicable commodity pool remain below specified thresholds; in the event that those thresholds are crossed, registration is required and the commodity pool operator may be out of compliance with the applicable regulations until registration is complete. Registration entails several potentially costly and time-consuming requirements, including, without limitation, membership with the National Futures Association, a self-regulatory organization for the U.S. derivatives industry, and compliance with the regulatory framework applicable to registered commodity pool operators. The increased costs\nassociated with such registration may affect the manner in which the relevant funds conduct business and may adversely affect such fund\u2019s and our profitability. If for any reason any of these exemptions were to become unavailable to us, we could become subject to regulatory action, third-party claims or be required to register under certain regulatory regimes, and our businesses could be materially and adversely affected. See, for example, \u201c-Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure-If we were deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our businesses as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our businesses and the price of our Class A shares and our Preferred shares.\u201d\nRegulatory environment of our funds and portfolio companies of our funds. The regulatory environment in which our funds and portfolio companies of our funds operate may affect our businesses. Certain laws, such as environmental laws, insurance regulations, gaming laws, takeover laws, anti-bribery and other anti-corruption laws, sanctions laws, escheat or abandoned property laws, and CFIUS and antitrust laws, may impose requirements on us, our funds and portfolio companies of our funds. For example, certain of our funds or vehicles may invest in the manufacturing sector, natural resources industry or own real assets where environmental laws, regulations and regulatory initiatives and various zoning laws can play a significant role and can have a substantial effect on investments in the industry. Such investments or assets may increase our exposure to regulatory compliance expense and risk of liability under environmental laws that impose, regardless of fault, joint and several liability for the cost of remediating contamination and compensation for damages. In addition, changes in environmental laws or regulations or the environmental condition of an investment may create liabilities that did not exist at the time of acquisition. Even in cases where our funds are indemnified by a seller against liabilities arising out of violations of environmental laws and regulations, there can be no assurance as to the financial viability of the seller or its insurers to satisfy such indemnities or our ability to achieve enforcement of such indemnities. Additionally, changes in antitrust laws or the enforcement of antitrust laws could affect the level of mergers and acquisitions activity, and changes in state laws may limit investment activities of state pension plans. For additional examples, see \u201c-Insurance regulation\u201d and \u201c-U.S. and foreign anti-corruption, sanctions and export control laws applicable to us and our funds and our funds\u2019 portfolio companies create the potential for significant liabilities and penalties and reputational harm.\u201d See \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulatory and Compliance Matters\u201d for a further discussion of the regulatory environment in which we conduct our businesses.\nCertain of the funds and accounts we manage or advise as well as certain of our funds\u2019 portfolio companies that engage in originating, lending and/or servicing loans may be subject to state and federal regulation, borrower disclosure requirements, limits on fees and interest rates on some loans, state lender licensing requirements and other regulatory requirements in the conduct of their business. These funds and accounts may also be subject to consumer disclosures and substantive requirements on consumer loan terms and other federal regulatory requirements applicable to consumer lending that are administered by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. These state and federal regulatory programs are designed to protect borrowers. For example, subsidiaries of our funds\u2019 portfolio companies include consumer finance companies operating in the U.S. The consumer finance business is subject to federal and state laws, and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in regulatory actions, including substantial fines or penalties, lawsuits and damage to our reputation. In addition, certain of the states in which such entities are licensed to originate loans have laws or regulations which require regulatory approval for the acquisition of \u201ccontrol\u201d of regulated entities. Therefore, any person acquiring directly or indirectly 10% or more of a licensed entity\u2019s common stock may need the prior approval of licensing regulators, or a determination from such regulators that \u201ccontrol\u201d has not been acquired, which could significantly delay or otherwise impede our ability to complete a transaction.\nState and federal regulators and other governmental entities have authority to bring administrative enforcement actions or litigation to enforce compliance with applicable lending or consumer protection laws, with remedies that can include fines and monetary penalties, restitution of borrowers, injunctions to conform to law, or limitation or revocation of licenses and other remedies and penalties. In addition, lenders and servicers may be subject to litigation brought by or on behalf of borrowers for violations of laws or unfair or deceptive practices. Failure to conform to applicable regulatory and legal requirements could be costly and have a detrimental impact on certain of our funds or our funds\u2019 portfolio companies and ultimately on Apollo.\nWe are deemed by the FCC to control certain radio and television broadcast stations that are owned by a company in which one of our funds has a majority investment. As a result, we are subject to FCC ownership restrictions that could limit our ability and the ability of our funds to make investments in other radio or television broadcast stations or in daily newspapers in some U.S. markets. We are also subject to FCC restrictions on the ownership of our stock by non-U.S. persons or entities. We must report to the FCC if we or any of our officers or directors or controlling stockholders are convicted of a felony or of violating certain laws.\nOur funds along with their affiliates may obtain a controlling interest (e.g., 80% or more voting control) in certain portfolio companies which may impose risks of liability to such funds under ERISA for a portfolio company\u2019s underfunded\npension plans, including withdrawal liability under any multiemployer plans in which such portfolio company contributes or previously contributed. Such liabilities might arise if any fund (or its general partner or management company, on behalf of such fund) were deemed to be engaged in a \u201ctrade or business\u201d under ERISA. The determination of whether an investment fund is engaged in a trade or business under ERISA is uncertain and could depend upon which U.S. Federal Circuit has jurisdiction over the matter. At least one Circuit Court has held that an investment fund was in a \u201ctrade or business\u201d for this purpose. Activities that may indicate the existence of a trade or business rather than a passive investment include, but are not limited to, involvement in the management of a portfolio company\u2019s operations, exercising authority with respect to the hiring, termination and compensation of such portfolio company\u2019s employees and agents and receiving fees or other compensation that offset the management fee for services provided to such portfolio company by the relevant fund manager or its affiliates. If any of our funds (along with its affiliates) were treated as engaged in a trade or business for purposes of ERISA and own together with related funds, 80% or more voting control of a portfolio company, then that fund (and certain affiliates of such fund in the same ERISA controlled group (e.g., other controlled portfolio companies)) could be jointly and severally liable to satisfy the liabilities of a specific portfolio company to an ERISA pension plan (i.e., one of our funds might suffer a loss that is greater than its actual investment in a specific portfolio company to the extent that such portfolio company becomes insolvent and is unable to satisfy its own obligations). It should be noted that the test as to whether a fund is engaged in a trade or business for purposes of ERISA may not necessarily be the same as the test that would be used for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It also should be noted that a recent Circuit Court decision held that two related private equity funds did not create an implied partnership-in-fact constituting a controlled group, and therefore, the funds could not be held liable for the multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability of a portfolio company that was 100% owned by two private equity funds. In this case, one private equity fund owned 70%, and the other private equity fund owned 30%, of the portfolio company. Because the Circuit Court found that the two entities were not structured in a way that indicated a shared purpose as a partnership, their ownership of the portfolio company was not aggregated in determining whether the funds were in the same controlled group as the portfolio company. This holding is specific to the facts of this case and may not apply to other affiliated funds.\nIn addition, regulators may scrutinize, investigate or take action against us as a result of actions or inactions by portfolio companies operating in a regulated industry if such a regulator were to deem, or potentially deem, such portfolio company to be under our control. For example, based on positions taken by European governmental authorities, we or certain of our investment funds potentially could be liable for fines if portfolio companies deemed to be under our control are found to have violated European antitrust laws. Such potential, or future, liability may materially affect our business.\nRegulatory environment for control persons. We could become jointly and severally liable for all or part of fines imposed on portfolio companies of our funds or be fined directly for violations committed by portfolio companies, and such fines imposed directly on us could be greater than those imposed on the portfolio company. The fact that we or one of our funds exercises control or exerts influence (or merely has the ability to exercise control or exert influence) over a company may impose risks of liability (including under various theories of parental liability and piercing the corporate veil doctrines) to us and our funds for, among other things, environmental damage, product defects, employee benefits (including pension and other fringe benefits), failure to supervise management, violation of laws and governmental regulations (including securities laws, anti-trust laws, employment laws, and anti-bribery and other anti-corruption laws) and other types of liability for which the limited liability characteristic of business ownership and the relevant fund itself (and the limited liability structures that may be utilized by such fund in connection with its ownership of its portfolio companies or otherwise) may be ignored or pierced, as if such limited liability characteristics or structures did not exist for purposes of the application of such laws, rules regulations and court decisions. Under certain circumstances, we could also be held liable under federal securities or state common law for statements made by or on behalf of portfolio companies of our funds. These risks of liability may arise pursuant to U.S. and non-U.S. laws, rules, regulations, court decisions or otherwise (including the laws, rules, regulations and court decisions that apply in jurisdictions in which our funds\u2019 portfolio companies or their subsidiaries are organized, headquartered or conduct business). Such liabilities may also arise to the extent that any such laws, rules, regulations or court decisions are interpreted or applied in a manner that imposes liability on all persons that stand to economically benefit (directly or indirectly) from ownership of portfolio companies, even if such persons do not exercise control or otherwise exert influence over such portfolio companies (e.g., limited partners). Lawmakers, regulators and plaintiffs have recently made (and may continue to make) claims along the lines of the foregoing, some of which have been successful. If these liabilities were to arise with respect to any of our funds or portfolio companies of our funds, the fund or portfolio company might suffer significant losses and incur significant liabilities and obligations that may, in turn, affect our results of operations. The possession or exercise of control or influence over a portfolio company could expose our assets and those of our relevant fund, its partners, general partner, management company and their respective affiliates to claims by such portfolio company, its security holders and its creditors and regulatory authorities or other bodies. While we intend to manage our operations to minimize exposure to these risks, the possibility of successful claims cannot be precluded, nor can there be any assurance to whether such laws, rules, regulations and court decisions will be expanded or otherwise applied in a manner that is adverse to us. Moreover, it is possible that, when evaluating a potential portfolio investment, we, as manager of our funds, may choose not to pursue or consummate such portfolio\ninvestment, if any of the foregoing risks may create liabilities or other obligations for us, any of our funds or any of their respective affiliates.\nInsurance regulation. State insurance departments in the U.S. have broad administrative powers over the insurance business of our U.S. insurance company affiliates, including insurance company licensing and examination, agent licensing, establishment of reserve requirements and solvency standards, premium rate regulation, admissibility of assets, policy form approval, unfair trade and claims practices, marketing practices, advertising, maintaining policyholder privacy, payment of dividends and distributions to stockholders, investments, review and/or approval of transactions with affiliates, reinsurance, acquisitions, mergers and other matters. State regulators regularly review and update these and other requirements.\nWe are subject to insurance holding company system laws and regulations in the states of domicile of certain insurance companies for which we are (or, with respect to certain pending transactions, will be) deemed to be a control person for purposes of such laws. Specifically, under state insurance laws, we are deemed to be the ultimate parent of (i) Athene Holding\u2019s insurance company subsidiaries, which are domiciled in Delaware, Iowa and New York, (ii) Catalina\u2019s insurance company subsidiaries, which are domiciled in California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia and New York, (iii) OneMain\u2019s insurance company subsidiaries, which are domiciled in Texas, (iv) Venerable\u2019s insurance subsidiary, which is domiciled in Iowa, (v) LifePoint\u2019s health maintenance organization subsidiary, which is domiciled in Michigan and (vi) Aspen\u2019s insurance company subsidiaries domiciled in North Dakota and Texas for purposes of such laws. Each of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Iowa, Michigan, New York, North Dakota and Texas is a \u201cDomiciliary State\u201d.\nThe scope of regulation of insurance holding companies has increased in both the U.S. and internationally. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the \u201cNAIC\u201d) adopted amendments to the insurance holding company system model law that introduced the concept of \u201centerprise risk\u201d within an insurance holding company system and imposed more extensive informational reporting regarding parents and other affiliates of insurance companies, with the purpose of protecting domestic insurers from enterprise risk, including requiring an annual enterprise risk report by the ultimate controlling person identifying the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to domestic insurers. Changes to existing NAIC model laws or regulations must be adopted by individual states or foreign jurisdictions before they will become effective. To date, each of the Domiciliary States has enacted laws to adopt such amendments. In December 2020, the NAIC adopted a group capital calculation tool (\u201cGCC\u201d) that uses a Risk-Based Capital aggregation methodology to provide U.S. regulators with a method to aggregate the available capital of each entity in a group in a way that applies to all groups regardless of their structure. The NAIC has also adopted changes to the insurance holding company system model law to require, subject to certain exceptions, the ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject to the holding company registration requirement to file an annual group capital calculation with its lead state. The NAIC has stated that the group capital calculation will be a regulatory tool and will not constitute a requirement or standard. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the additional capital requirements, compliance costs or other burdens these requirements may impose on us and our insurance company affiliates.\nInternationally, in November 2019, the IAIS adopted a framework for the \u201cgroup wide\u201d supervision of internationally active insurance groups, including the development of a risk-based global insurance capital standard. The ICS will be implemented in the following two phases: in the first phase, which will last for five years and which is referred to as the \u201cmonitoring period,\u201d the ICS will be used for confidential reporting to group-wide supervisors and discussion in supervisory colleges, and the ICS will not be used as a prescribed capital requirement. After the monitoring period, the ICS will be implemented as a group-wide prescribed capital standard. In addition, in the U.S., the NAIC and the Federal Reserve Board are developing a group capital calculation tool using a risk-based capital aggregation method, similar to the GCC, for all entities within the insurance holding company, including non-U.S. entities and are seeking effective equivalency of such tool to the ICS for US-based IAIGs. In the U.S., the NAIC has also promulgated additional amendments to the insurance holding company system model law that address \u201cgroup wide\u201d supervision of internationally active insurance groups. To date, each of the Domiciliary States has adopted a form of these provisions, with New York recently adopting Insurance Regulation 203, which permits the New York Superintendent of Financial Services to act as group-wide supervisor of an IAIG that conducts substantial insurance operations in New York. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the additional capital requirements, compliance costs or other burdens these requirements may impose on us and our insurance company affiliates.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act established the FIO within the U.S. Department of the Treasury headed by a Director appointed by the Treasury Secretary. While currently not having a general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, the Director of the FIO performs various functions with respect to insurance, including serving as a non-voting member of the FSOC and making recommendations to the FSOC regarding non-bank financial companies to be designated as SIFIs. The Director of the FIO has also submitted reports to the U.S. Congress on (i) modernization of U.S. insurance\nregulation (provided in December 2013) and (ii) the U.S. and global reinsurance market (provided in November 2013 and January 2015, respectively). Such reports could ultimately lead to changes in the regulation of insurers and reinsurers in the U.S.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act authorized the Treasury Secretary and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to negotiate covered agreements. A covered agreement is an agreement between the U.S. and one or more foreign governments, authorities or regulatory entities, regarding prudential measures with respect to insurance or reinsurance. Pursuant to this authority, in September 2017, the U.S. and the EU signed the EU Covered Agreement and the U.S. released the Policy Statement providing the U.S.\u2019s interpretation of certain provisions in the EU Covered Agreement. The Policy Statement provides that the U.S. expects that the group capital calculation, which is currently being developed by the NAIC, will satisfy the EU Covered Agreement\u2019s group capital assessment requirement. In addition, on December 18, 2018, the U.K. Covered Agreement was signed in anticipation of the U.K.\u2019s exit from the EU. U.S. state regulators have until September 22, 2022 to adopt reinsurance reforms removing reinsurance collateral requirements for EU and U.K. reinsurers that meet the prescribed minimum conditions set forth in the EU Covered Agreement and U.K. Covered Agreement or else state laws imposing such reinsurance collateral requirements may be subject to federal preemption. In 2019, the NAIC adopted revisions to the Credit for Reinsurance Model Law and Regulation that would, if adopted into law by state regulators, implement the reinsurance collateral provisions of the EU Covered Agreement and the U.K. Covered Agreement. California and Iowa have adopted the 2019 amendments to the Credit for Reinsurance Model Law and Regulation and each of Connecticut and Michigan currently have pending legislation to adopt such amendments. In addition, in December 2020, the NYSDFS announced proposed changes to the New York regulations on credit for reinsurance for New York-domiciled insurers to implement the changes set forth in the amended Credit for Reinsurance Model Law and Regulation. The NAIC has recently adopted a new accreditation standard that requires states to adopt the revisions no later than September 1, 2022, which is likely to motivate the remaining Domiciliary States to adopt the amendments. The reinsurance collateral provisions of the EU Covered Agreement or the U.K. Covered Agreement may increase competition, in particular with respect to pricing for reinsurance transactions, by lowering the cost at which competitors of the reinsurance subsidiaries of our insurance company affiliates, such as Athene Holding\u2019s direct, wholly owned subsidiary ALRe, are able to provide reinsurance to U.S. insurers.\nAs the ultimate parent of the general partner or manager of certain shareholders of Athene Holding, we are subject to certain insurance laws and regulations in Bermuda, where Apollo is considered a \u201cshareholder controller\u201d of (a) ALRe, a Bermuda Class E insurance company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Athene Holding, a company listed on the NYSE as well as its direct and indirect Bermuda domiciled insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries, (b) ALREI, a Bermuda Class C insurer and wholly-owned subsidiary of Athene Holding, (c) Athora Life Re, a Bermuda Class E insurance company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Athora Holding Ltd., a Bermuda private company, (d) Catalina General, a Bermuda Class 3A and Class C insurer and a wholly owned subsidiary of Catalina Holding (Bermuda) Ltd., and (e) Aspen Bermuda, a Class 4 insurer and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aspen. Each of ALRe, ALREI, Athora Life Re, Catalina General and Aspen Bermuda is subject to regulation and supervision by the BMA and compliance with all applicable Bermuda law and Bermuda insurance statutes and regulations, including but not limited to the Bermuda Insurance Act. Under the Bermuda Insurance Act, the BMA maintains supervision over the \u201ccontrollers\u201d of all registered insurers in Bermuda. For these purposes, a \u201ccontroller\u201d includes a shareholder controller (as defined in the Bermuda Insurance Act). The Bermuda Insurance Act imposes certain notice requirements upon any person that has become, or as a result of a disposition ceased to be, a shareholder controller, and failure to comply with such requirements is punishable by a fine or imprisonment or both. In addition, the BMA may file a notice of objection to any person or entity who has become a controller of any description where it appears that such person or entity is not, or is no longer, fit and proper to be a controller of the registered insurer, and such person or entity can be subject to fines or imprisonment or both. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent an acquisition of controllers of Bermuda insurers.\nIn addition, for purposes of insurance laws Apollo is considered to be the parent and/or indirect qualifying shareholder of certain European insurance companies domiciled in Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the U.K. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulatory and Compliance Matters.\u201d These laws and regulations may discourage potential acquisition offers and may delay, deter or prevent the acquisition of qualifying holdings as these affect insurance undertakings in such countries.\nThe regulatory and legal requirements that apply to our activities are subject to change from time to time and may become more restrictive, which may impose additional expenses on us, make compliance with applicable requirements more difficult, require attention of senior management, or otherwise restrict our ability to conduct our business activities in the manner in which they are now conducted. They also may result in fines or other sanctions if we or any of our funds are deemed to have violated any laws or regulations. We also may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of\nexisting laws and rules. Changes in applicable regulatory and legal requirements, including changes in their enforcement, could materially and adversely affect our businesses and our financial condition and results of operations.\nInvestment advisers have come under increased scrutiny from regulators, including the SEC and other government and self-regulatory organizations, with a particular focus on fees, allocation of expenses to funds, valuation practices, and related disclosures to fund investors. Public statements by regulators, in particular the SEC, indicate increased enforcement attention will continue to be focused on investment advisers, which has the potential to affect us. We also may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and self-regulatory organizations.\nRegulatory investigations and enforcement actions may adversely affect our operations and create the potential for significant liabilities, penalties and reputational harm.\nThere can be no assurance that we or our affiliates will avoid regulatory examination and possibly enforcement actions. SEC enforcement actions and settlements involving U.S.-based private fund advisers have involved a number of issues, including the undisclosed allocation of the fees, costs and expenses related to unconsummated co-investment transactions (i.e., the allocation of broken deal expenses), undisclosed legal fee arrangements affording the applicable adviser with greater discounts than those afforded to funds advised by such adviser and the undisclosed acceleration of certain special fees. Recent SEC focus areas have also included the use and compensation of, and disclosure regarding, operating partners or consultants, outside business activities of firm principals and employees, group purchasing arrangements and general conflicts of interest disclosures.\nIf the SEC or any other governmental authority, regulatory agency or similar body takes issue with our past practices, we will be at risk for regulatory sanction. Even if an investigation or proceeding does not result in a sanction or the sanction imposed is small in monetary amount, the adverse publicity relating to the investigation, proceeding or imposition of these sanctions could harm us and our reputation which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nU.S. and foreign anti-corruption, sanctions and export control laws applicable to us and our funds and our funds\u2019 portfolio companies create the potential for significant liabilities and penalties and reputational harm.\nWe are subject to a number of laws and regulations governing payments and contributions to public officials or other parties, including restrictions imposed by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), as well as economic sanctions and export control laws administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d), the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of State. The FCPA is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign public officials and political parties, and requires public companies in the U.S. to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect their transactions. The U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of State administer and enforce certain export control laws and regulations, and OFAC and the U.S. Department of State administer and enforce economic sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted countries, territories, regimes, entities, organizations and individuals. These laws and regulations relate to a number of aspects of our businesses, including servicing existing fund investors, finding new fund investors, and sourcing new investments, as well as activities by the portfolio companies of our funds. In recent years, the U.S. government has devoted greater resources to enforcement of the FCPA and sanctions and export control laws. A number of other countries have also expanded significantly their enforcement activities, especially in the anti-corruption area. Recently, the U.S. government has also used sanctions and export controls to address broader foreign and international economic policy goals. While we have developed and implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance by us and our personnel with the FCPA and other applicable anti-bribery laws, as well as with sanctions and export control laws, such policies and procedures may not be effective in all instances to prevent violations. Any determination that we have violated these laws could subject us to, among other things, civil and criminal penalties, material fines, profit disgorgement, injunctions on future conduct, securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence, any one of which could adversely affect our business prospects and/or financial position.\nIn addition, we may also be adversely affected if there is misconduct by personnel of portfolio companies in which our funds invest. For example, failures by personnel at our funds\u2019 portfolio companies to comply with anti-bribery, sanctions or export control requirements could create liability for us, cause significant reputational and business harm to us and negatively affect the valuations of a fund\u2019s investments.\nThe SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d), the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, as well as certain U.S. states, localities, and public instrumentalities, have adopted \u201cpay-to-play\u201d laws, rules, regulations and/or policies which restrict the political activities of investment managers that seek investment from or manage funds on behalf of\nstate and local government entities. Such restrictions can include limits on the ability of such managers covered investment advisers, certain covered employees of the adviser or covered political action committees controlled by the adviser or its employees to make political contributions to or fundraise for certain state and local candidates, officials, and political organizations, as well as obligations to make regular disclosures about such political activities to federal, state, or local regulators and to use only parties that are subject to equivalent political activity restrictions in soliciting investment from state and local government entities. In addition, many pay-to-play regimes (including the SEC pay-to-play rule for investment advisers) impute the personal political activities of certain executives and employees, and in some instances their spouses and family members, to the manager for purposes of potential pay-to-play liability. Violation of pay-to-play laws can lead to the loss of management fees, rescission of current commitments to our funds, and a loss of future investment opportunities, and issues involving pay-to-play violations and alleged pay-to-play violations often receive substantial media coverage and can result in regulatory inquires from federal, state of local regulators. Any failure on our part or a party acting on our behalf to comply with applicable pay-to-play laws, regulations or policies could expose us to significant penalties and reputational damage, and could have a material adverse impact on us.\nThe Iran Threat Reduction and Syrian Human Rights Act of 2012 (\u201cITRA\u201d) expanded the scope of U.S. sanctions against Iran. Notably, ITRA generally prohibits foreign entities that are majority owned or controlled by U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with Iran. In addition, Section 219 of ITRA amended the Exchange Act to require public reporting companies to disclose in their annual or quarterly reports certain dealings or transactions the company or its affiliates engaged in during the previous reporting period involving Iran or individuals or entities targeted by certain OFAC sanctions. ITRA may require companies to disclose these types of transactions even if they were permissible under U.S. law or were conducted outside of the U.S. by a non-U.S. entity. Companies that have been considered our affiliates at the time have publicly filed and/or provided to us the disclosures reproduced in certain of the Company\u2019s periodic reports filed with the SEC in 2013 and 2014. We are required to separately file, concurrently with our annual and quarterly reports that contain such a disclosure, a notice that such activities have been disclosed in our report. The SEC is required to post this notice of disclosure on its website and send the report to the U.S. President and certain U.S. Congressional committees. Disclosure of such activity, even if such activity is not subject to penalties or sanctions under applicable law, could harm our reputation and have a negative impact on our business.\nDifferences between U.S. and foreign anti-corruption, sanctions and export control laws increase the risks and complexities of compliance, and sometimes present actual conflicts of law (especially in the sanctions area). If we fail to comply with this multitude of laws and regulations, even where conflicts of law arise, we could be exposed to claims for damages, civil or criminal penalties, reputational harm, incarceration of our employees, restrictions on our operations and other liabilities, which could negatively affect our businesses, operating results and financial condition. In addition, depending on the circumstances, we could be subject to liability for violations of applicable anti-corruption, sanctions or export control laws committed by companies in which we or our funds invest or which we or our funds acquire.\nWe are subject to third-party litigation from time to time that could result in significant liabilities and reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nIn general, we will be exposed to risk of litigation by our investors if our management of any fund is alleged to constitute bad faith, gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud, willful or reckless disregard for our duties to the fund, breach of fiduciary duties or securities laws, or other forms of misconduct. Fund investors could sue us to recover amounts lost by our funds due to our alleged misconduct, up to the entire amount of loss. Further, we may be subject to litigation arising from investor dissatisfaction with the performance of our funds or from third-party allegations that we (i) improperly exercised control or influence over companies in which our funds have large investments or (ii) are liable for actions or inactions taken by portfolio companies that such third parties argue we control. By way of example, we, our funds and certain of our employees are each exposed to the risks of litigation relating to investment activities in our funds and actions taken by the officers and directors (some of whom may be Apollo employees) of portfolio companies, such as the risk of stockholder litigation by other stockholders of public companies in which our funds have large investments. As an additional example, we are sometimes listed as a co-defendant in actions against portfolio companies on the theory that we control such portfolio companies. We are also exposed to risks of litigation or investigation relating to transactions that presented conflicts of interest that were not properly addressed. See \u201c-Our failure to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest could damage our reputation and adversely affect our businesses.\u201d In addition, our rights to indemnification by the funds we manage may not be upheld if challenged, and our indemnification rights generally do not cover bad faith, gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud, willful or reckless disregard for our duties to the fund or other forms of misconduct. If we are required to incur all or a portion of the costs arising out of litigation or investigations as a result of inadequate insurance proceeds or failure to obtain indemnification from our funds, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, with many highly paid investment professionals and complex compensation and incentive arrangements, we face the risk of lawsuits relating to claims for compensation, which may individually or in the aggregate be significant in amount. Such claims are more likely to occur in situations where individual employees may experience significant volatility in their year-to-year compensation due to company performance or other issues and in situations where previously highly compensated employees were terminated for performance or efficiency reasons. The cost of settling such claims could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf any civil or criminal litigation brought against us were to result in a finding of substantial legal liability or culpability, the litigation could, in addition to any financial damage, cause significant reputational harm to us, which could seriously harm our business. We depend to a large extent on our business relationships and our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain investors and qualified professionals and to pursue investment opportunities for our funds. As a result, allegations of improper conduct by private litigants or regulators, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us, our investment activities or the private equity industry in general, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation, which may be more damaging to our businesses than to other types of businesses. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nIn addition, we may not be able to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance on commercially reasonable terms or with adequate coverage levels against potential liabilities we may face in connection with potential claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may face a risk of loss from a variety of claims, including related to securities, antitrust, contracts, fraud and various other potential claims, whether or not such claims are valid. Insurance and other safeguards might only partially reimburse us for our losses, if at all, and if a claim is successful and exceeds or is not covered by our insurance policies, we may be required to pay a substantial amount in respect of such successful claim. Certain losses of a catastrophic nature, such as wars, earthquakes, typhoons, terrorist attacks, pandemics, health crises or other similar events, may be uninsurable or may only be insurable at rates that are so high that maintaining coverage would cause an adverse impact on our business, our investment funds and their portfolio companies. In general, losses related to terrorism are becoming harder and more expensive to insure against. Some insurers are excluding terrorism coverage from their all-risk policies. In some cases, insurers are offering significantly limited coverage against terrorist acts for additional premiums, which can greatly increase the total cost of casualty insurance for a property. As a result, we, our investment funds and their portfolio companies may not be insured against terrorism or certain other catastrophic losses.\nWe often pursue investment opportunities that involve business, regulatory, legal or other complexities.\nAs an element of our investment style, we often pursue unusually complex investment opportunities. This can often take the form of substantial business, regulatory or legal complexity that we believe may deter other investment managers. Our tolerance for complexity presents risks, as such transactions can be more difficult, expensive and time-consuming to finance and execute; it can be more difficult to manage or realize value from the assets acquired in such transactions; and such transactions sometimes entail a higher level of regulatory scrutiny or a greater risk of contingent liabilities. Any of these risks could harm the performance of our funds.\nRegulations governing AINV\u2019s operation as a business development company affect its ability to raise, and the way in which it raises, additional capital.\nAs a business development company under the Investment Company Act, AINV may issue debt securities or preferred stock and/or borrow money from banks or other financial institutions (referred to collectively as \u201csenior securities\u201d) up to the maximum amount permitted by the Investment Company Act. As a business development company, AINV is generally required to meet an asset coverage ratio of total assets to total borrowings and other senior securities, which include all of its borrowings and any preferred stock it may issue in the future, of at least 150%. If this ratio declines below 150%, the contractual arrangements governing these securities may require AINV to sell a portion of its investments and, depending on the nature of its leverage, repay a portion of its indebtedness at a time when such sales may be disadvantageous.\nBusiness development companies may issue and sell common stock at a price below net asset value per share only in limited circumstances, one of which is during the one-year period after stockholder approval. In the past, AINV\u2019s stockholders have approved a plan so that during the subsequent 12-month period, AINV could, in one or more public or private offerings of its common stock, sell or otherwise issue shares of its common stock at a price below the then current net asset value per share, subject to certain conditions including parameters on the level of permissible dilution, approval of the sale by a majority of its independent directors and a requirement that the sale price be not less than approximately the market price of the shares of its common stock at specified times, less the expenses of the sale. Although AINV currently does not have such authority, it may\nin the future seek to receive such authority on terms and conditions set forth in the corresponding proxy statement. There is no assurance such approvals will be obtained.\nIn the event AINV sells, or otherwise issues, shares of its common stock at a price below net asset value per share, existing AINV stockholders will experience net asset value dilution and the investors who acquire shares in such offering may thereafter experience the same type of dilution from subsequent offerings at a discount. For example, if AINV sells an additional 10% of its common shares at a 5% discount from net asset value, an AINV stockholder who does not participate in that offering for its proportionate interest will suffer net asset value dilution of up to 0.5% or $5 per $1,000 of net asset value.\nIn addition to issuing securities to raise capital as described above, AINV may in the future securitize its loans to generate cash for funding new investments. To securitize loans, it may create a wholly-owned subsidiary, contribute a pool of loans to the subsidiary and have the subsidiary issue primarily investment grade debt securities to purchasers who it would expect would be willing to accept a substantially lower interest rate than the loans earn. AINV would retain all or a portion of the equity in the securitized pool of loans. AINV\u2019s retained equity would be exposed to any losses on the portfolio of loans before any of the debt securities would be exposed to such losses. An inability to successfully securitize its loan portfolio could limit its ability to grow its business and fully execute its business strategy and adversely affect its earnings, if any. Moreover, the successful securitization of its loan portfolio might expose it to losses as the residual loans in which it does not sell interests will tend to be those that are riskier and more apt to generate losses.\nIn addition, for federal income tax purposes AINV has elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (\u201cRIC\u201d) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). Under the Code, AINV must meet certain source-of-income, asset diversification and annual distribution requirements. AINV will be subject to corporate-level income tax if it is unable to maintain its status as a RIC, which would materially affect its ability to raise additional capital.\nRegulations governing AFT\u2019s and AIF\u2019s operation affect their ability to raise, and the way in which they raise, additional capital.\nAs investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act, AFT and AIF may issue debt securities or preferred stock and/or borrow money from banks or other lenders, up to the maximum amount permitted by the Investment Company Act. Under the provisions of the Investment Company Act, AFT and AIF are restricted in the (i) issuance of preferred shares to amounts such that their respective asset coverage (as defined in the Investment Company Act) equals at least 200% after issuance and (ii) incurrence of indebtedness, including through the issuance of debt securities, such that immediately after issuance the fund will have an asset coverage (as defined in the Investment Company Act) of at least 300%. Lenders to the funds may demand higher asset coverage ratios. Further, if the value of a funds\u2019 assets declines, such fund may be unable to satisfy its asset coverage requirements. If that happens, such fund, in order to pay dividends or repurchase its stock or to satisfy the requirements of its lenders, may be required to sell a portion of its investments and, depending on the nature of its leverage, repay a portion of its indebtedness at a time when such sales may be disadvantageous. Further, AFT and AIF may raise capital by issuing common shares, however, the offering price per common share generally must equal or exceed the net asset value per share, exclusive of any underwriting commissions or discounts, of the funds\u2019 shares.\nIf we were deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our businesses as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our businesses and the price of our Class A shares and our Preferred shares.\nWe do not believe that we are an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the Investment Company Act because the nature of our assets and the income derived from those assets allow us to rely on the exception provided by Rule 3a-1 issued under the Investment Company Act. In addition, we believe we are not an investment company under Section 3(b)(1) of the Investment Company Act because we are primarily engaged in non-investment company businesses. We intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company. However, if we were to be deemed an investment company, we would be subject to restrictions imposed by the Investment Company Act, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, could make it impractical for us to continue our businesses as contemplated and would have a material adverse effect on our businesses and the price of our Class A shares and our Preferred shares.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Shares and Our Preferred Shares\nThe market price and trading volume of our Class A shares and our Preferred shares may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders.\nThe market price of our Class A shares and our Preferred shares may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume in our Class A shares and our Preferred shares may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. You may be unable to resell your Class A shares and Preferred shares at or above your purchase price, if at all. The market price of our Class A shares and our Preferred shares may fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the price of our Class A shares and our Preferred shares or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our Class A shares and our Preferred shares include:\n\u2022variations in our quarterly operating results or dividends, which variations we expect will be substantial;\n\u2022our policy of taking a long-term perspective on making investment, operational and strategic decisions, which is expected to result in significant and unpredictable variations in our quarterly returns;\n\u2022our creditworthiness, results of operations and financial condition;\n\u2022the credit ratings of the Preferred shares;\n\u2022the prevailing interest rates or rates of return being paid by other companies similar to us and the market for similar securities;\n\u2022failure to meet analysts\u2019 earnings estimates;\n\u2022publication of research reports about us or the investment management industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover our Class A shares and our Preferred shares;\n\u2022additions or departures of our Managing Partners and other key management personnel;\n\u2022adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future;\n\u2022actions by stockholders;\n\u2022changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations thereof affecting our businesses or enforcement of these laws and regulations, or announcements relating to these matters;\n\u2022a lack of liquidity in the trading of our Class A shares and our Preferred shares;\n\u2022adverse publicity about the investment management industry generally or individual scandals, specifically;\n\u2022a breach of our computer systems, software or networks, or misappropriation of our proprietary information;\n\u2022the fact that we do not provide comprehensive guidance regarding our expected quarterly and annual revenues, earnings and cash flow; and\n\u2022economic, financial, geopolitical, regulatory or judicial events or conditions that affect us or the financial markets.\nIn addition, from time to time, we may also declare special quarterly dividends based on investment realizations. Volatility in the market price of our Class A shares may be heightened at or around times of investment realizations as well as following such realizations, as a result of speculation as to whether such a dividend may be declared.\nOur performance, market conditions and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to fluctuate in the future. Fluctuations in these factors could have an adverse effect on the price and liquidity of the Preferred shares. In general, as market interest rates rise, securities with fixed interest rates or fixed distribution rates, such as the Preferred shares, decline in value. Consequently, if you purchase the Preferred shares and market interest rates increase, the market price of the Preferred shares may decline. We cannot predict the future level of market interest rates.\nOur ability to pay quarterly dividends on the Preferred shares will be subject to, among other things, general business conditions, our financial results, restrictions under the terms of our existing and future indebtedness, and our liquidity needs. Any reduction or discontinuation of quarterly dividends could cause the market price of the Preferred shares to decline significantly. Accordingly, the Preferred shares may trade at a discount to their purchase price.\nAn investment in Class A shares and our Preferred shares is not an investment in any of our funds, and the assets and revenues of our funds are not directly available to us.\nOur Class A shares and our Preferred shares are securities of Apollo Global Management, Inc. only. While our historical consolidated and combined financial information includes financial information, including assets and revenues of certain Apollo funds on a consolidated basis, and our future financial information will continue to consolidate certain of these funds, such assets and revenues are available to the fund, and not to us except through management fees, performance fees, distributions and other proceeds arising from agreements with funds, as discussed in more detail in this report.\nOur Class A share price may decline due to the large number of shares eligible for future sale and for exchange into Class A shares.\nThe market price of our Class A shares could decline as a result of sales of a large number of our Class A shares or the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. As of December 31, 2020, we had 228,873,449 Class A shares outstanding. The Class A shares reserved under our 2019 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2019 Equity Plan\u201d) are increased on the first day of each fiscal year by (i) the amount (if any) by which (a) 15% of the number of outstanding Class A shares and Apollo Operating Group units (\u201cAOG Units\u201d) exchangeable for Class A shares on a fully converted and diluted basis on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year exceeds (b) the number of shares then reserved and available for issuance under the 2019 Equity Plan, or (ii) such lesser amount by which the administrator may decide to increase the number of Class A shares. Taking into account grants of restricted share units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) and options made through December 31, 2020, 49,115,290 Class A shares remained available for future grant under the 2019 Equity Plan. The number of shares granted under our 2019 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan for Estate Planning Vehicles (the \u201cEPV Equity Plan\u201d) will reduce the number of shares available for grant under the 2019 Equity Plan, and the number of shares granted under the 2019 Equity Plan will reduce the number of shares available for grant under the EPV Equity Plan. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, Holdings could at any time exchange its AOG Units for up to174,873,808 Class A shares on behalf of our Managing Partners and Contributing Partners subject to the Amended and Restated Exchange Agreement. See \u201cItem 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence-Amended and Restated Exchange Agreement.\u201d We may also elect to sell additional Class A shares in one or more future primary offerings.\nOur Managing Partners and Contributing Partners, through their partnership interests in Holdings, owned an aggregate of 40.4% of the AOG Units as of December 31, 2020. Subject to certain prior notice provisions and other procedures and restrictions (including any transfer restrictions and lock-up agreements applicable to our Managing Partners and Contributing Partners), each Managing Partner and Contributing Partner has the right to exchange the AOG Units for Class A shares. These Class A shares are eligible for resale from time to time, subject to certain contractual restrictions and applicable securities laws.\nOur Managing Partners and Contributing Partners (through Holdings) have the ability to cause us to register the Class A shares they acquire upon exchange of their AOG Units, as was done in connection with the Company\u2019s Secondary Offering in May 2013. See \u201cItem 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence-Managing Partner Shareholders Agreement-Registration Rights.\u201d\nWe have on file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 covering the shares issuable under the 2019 Equity Plan. Subject to vesting and contractual lock-up arrangements, such shares will be freely tradable.\nWe cannot assure you that our intended quarterly dividends will be paid each quarter or at all.\nOur intention is to distribute to the holders of our Class A shares and our Preferred shares on a quarterly basis substantially all of our net after-tax cash flow from operations in excess of amounts determined by the executive committee of our board of directors to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of our businesses, to make appropriate investments in our businesses and our funds, to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to service our indebtedness or to provide for future dividends to the holders of our Class A shares and our Preferred shares for any ensuing quarter. Our intention is also that such quarterly dividend will be, at a minimum, $0.40 per Class A share. The declaration, payment and determination of the amount of our quarterly dividend, if any, at the intended minimum amount or at all, will be at the sole discretion of the executive committee of our board of directors, who may change our dividend policy at any time. We cannot assure you that any dividends, whether quarterly or otherwise, will or can be paid. In making decisions regarding our quarterly dividend, the executive committee of our board of directors considers general economic and business conditions, our strategic plans and prospects, our businesses and investment opportunities, our financial condition and operating results, working capital requirements and anticipated cash needs, contractual restrictions and obligations, legal, tax, regulatory and other restrictions that\nmay have implications on the payment of dividends by us to the holders of our Class A shares and our Preferred shares or by our subsidiaries to us, and such other factors as the executive committee of our board of directors may deem relevant.\nOur Preferred shares rank senior to our Class A shares with respect to the payment of dividends. Subject to certain exceptions, unless dividends have been declared and paid or declared and set apart for payment on the Preferred shares for a quarterly dividend period, during the remainder of that dividend period, we may not declare or pay or set apart payment for dividends on any Class A shares and any other equity securities that the Company may issue in the future ranking, as to the payment of dividends, junior to our Preferred shares and we may not repurchase any such junior shares. Dividends on the Preferred shares are discretionary and non-cumulative.\nIf dividends on a series of the Preferred shares have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more quarterly dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, holders of the Preferred shares, together as a class with holders of any other series of parity shares with like voting rights, will be entitled to vote for the election of two additional directors to the board of directors. When quarterly dividends have been declared and paid on such series of the Preferred shares for four consecutive quarters following such a nonpayment event, the right of the holders of the Preferred shares and such parity shares to elect these two additional directors will cease, the terms of office of these two directors will forthwith terminate and the number of directors constituting the board of directors will be reduced accordingly.\nAwards of our Class A shares may increase stockholder dilution and reduce profitability.\nWe grant Class A restricted share units to certain of our investment professionals and other personnel, both when hired and as a portion of the discretionary annual compensation they may receive. We require that a portion of the performance fees distributions payable by the general partners of certain of the funds we manage be used by the recipients of those distributions to purchase restricted Class A shares issued under our equity incentive plan. While this practice promotes alignment with stockholders and encourages investment professionals to maximize the success of the Company as a whole, these equity awards, if fulfilled by issuances of new shares by us rather than by open market purchases (which do not cause any dilution), may increase personnel-related stockholder dilution. In addition, volatility in the price of our Class A shares could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain our investment professionals and other personnel. To recruit and retain existing and future investment professionals, we may need to increase the level of compensation that we pay to them, which may cause a higher percentage of our revenue to be paid out in the form of compensation, which would have an adverse impact on our profit margins.\nPurchases of our Class A shares pursuant to our share repurchase program may affect the value of our Class A shares, and there can be no assurance that our share repurchase program will enhance stockholder value.\nPursuant to our publicly announced share repurchase program, we are authorized to repurchase up to $500 million in the aggregate of our Class A shares, including through the repurchase of our outstanding Class A shares through a share repurchase program and through a reduction of Class A shares to be issued to employees to satisfy associated obligations in connection with the settlement of equity-based awards granted under the 2019 Equity Plan (and any successor equity plan thereto). The timing and amount of any share repurchases will be determined based on legal requirements, price, market and economic conditions and other factors. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of our Class A shares at that time. Additionally, repurchases under our share repurchase program have and will continue to diminish our cash reserves, which could impact our ability to pursue possible strategic opportunities and acquisitions and could result in lower overall returns on our cash balances. There can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our Class A shares could decline. Although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, short-term share price fluctuations could reduce the program\u2019s effectiveness.\nOur issuance of preferred stock may cause the price of our Class A shares to decline, which may negatively impact our Class A stockholders.\nOur board of directors is authorized to issue series of shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders and, with respect to each such series, fix, without stockholder approval (except as may be required by our Certificate of Incorporation or any certificate of designation relating to any outstanding series of preferred stock), the designation of such series, the powers (including voting powers), preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of such series of preferred stock and the number of shares of such series. Any series of preferred stock we may issue in the future will rank senior to all of our Class A shares with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up. If we issue cumulative preferred stock in the future that has preference over our Class A shares with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation,\ndissolution, or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our Class A stockholders, the market price of our Class A shares could decrease. Similarly, the governance documents of the Apollo Operating Group authorize entities that are members of the Apollo Operating Group to issue an unlimited number of additional AOG Units with such designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties that are different from, and may be senior to, those applicable to the AOG Units, and which may be exchangeable for AOG Units.\nRisks Related to Our Organization and Structure\nOur Class C Stockholder\u2019s significant voting power limits the ability of holders of our Class A shares to influence our business.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that, for so long as there is a Class C Stockholder and the Apollo Group beneficially owns, in the aggregate, 10% or more of the voting power of the Company, the Class C Stockholder shall, on all matters generally submitted for vote to the stockholders (the \u201cGeneral Stockholder Matters\u201d) be entitled to such number of votes as shall equal the difference of (A) nine and nine-tenths (9.9) times the aggregate number of votes entitled to be cast by the holders of Class A shares and full voting preferred stock, minus (B) the Aggregate Class B Vote, which is the number of votes equal to the aggregate number of units in the Apollo Operating Group outstanding as of the relevant record date, less the number of Class A shares outstanding as of the same relevant record date (the \u201cClass C Vote\u201d); provided that, for so long as there is a Class C Stockholder, the Aggregate Class B Vote shall not exceed 9% of the total votes entitled to be cast by holders of all shares of capital stock entitled to vote thereon. If the number of votes entitled to be cast by the holders Class A shares which are free float, as determined by the Company in reliance upon the guidance issued by FTSE Russell (the \u201cClass A Free Float\u201d), on any General Stockholder Matter equals less than 5.1% of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all shares of capital stock entitled to vote thereon as of the relevant record date: (1) the Class C Vote shall be reduced to equal such number as would result in the total number of votes cast by holders of the Class A Free Float being equal to 5.1% of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all shares of capital stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class (the \u201cClass A Free Float Adjustment\u201d); and (2) if, after giving effect to the Class A Free Float Adjustment, the Aggregate Class B Vote on any General Stockholder Matter would be in excess of 9% of the total number of the votes entitled to be cast thereon by the holders of all outstanding shares of capital stock, (x) the Aggregate Class B Vote shall be reduced to 9% of such total number and (y) the Class C Vote, as calculated after giving effect to the Class A Free Float Adjustment, shall be increased by a number of votes equal to the number of votes by which the Aggregate Class B Vote was reduced pursuant to the foregoing clause (x).\nOur Certificate of Incorporation also provides that, for so long as there is a Class C Stockholder and the Apollo Group beneficially owns, in the aggregate, 10% or more of the voting power of the Company, holders of the Class A shares (voting together with the holder of the shares of the Class B common stock (the \u201cClass B share\u201d) as a single class) shall have the right to vote with respect to (i) a sale, exchange or disposition of all or substantially all of AGM Inc.\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 assets, taken as a whole, in a single transaction or series of related transactions (provided, however, that this does not preclude or limit our ability to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in all or substantially all of the assets of our assets and those of our subsidiaries (including for the benefit of persons other than us or our subsidiaries, including affiliates of the Class C Stockholder) and does not apply to any forced sale of any or all of our assets pursuant to the foreclosure of, or other realization upon, any such encumbrance), (ii) a merger, consolidation or other business combination, (iii) certain amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws including amendments that would enlarge the obligations of the Class A stockholders and amendments that would have a material adverse effect on the rights or preferences of Class A stockholders, (iv) as otherwise required by the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d) or the rules of any national securities exchange, and (v) as required by the NYSE, including with respect to equity compensation plans, the issuance of common stock to a related person in excess of 1% of the outstanding shares of common stock or 1% of the voting power of AGM Inc., and the issuance of common stock in excess of 20% of the outstanding shares of common stock or 20% of the voting power of AGM Inc. Because holders of our Class A shares have limited voting rights as expressly provided in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws or required by the DGCL or the rules of the NYSE, practically all matters submitted to stockholders will be decided by the vote of the Class C Stockholder. The consent of the Class A and Class B stockholders is not required for a merger of AGM Inc. into, or convey all of AGM Inc.\u2019s assets to, a newly formed limited liability entity that has no assets, liabilities or operations at the time of such merger or conveyance other than those it receives from AGM Inc., if (a) AGM Inc. has received an opinion of counsel that the transaction would not result in the loss of the limited liability of any stockholder, (b) the sole purpose of such transaction is to effect a mere change in the legal form of AGM Inc. into another limited liability entity and (c) the governing documents of such new entity provides the AGM Inc. stockholders with substantially the same rights and obligations as they currently have. Our Certificate of Incorporation also provides that, for so long as there is a Class C Stockholder and the Apollo Group beneficially owns, in the aggregate, 10% or more of the voting power of the Company, the Class C Stockholder shall set the total number of directors which shall constitute the board of directors and fill any vacancies or newly created directorships on the board of directors. As a result, holders of the Class A shares will have a limited ability to\ninfluence stockholder decisions, including decisions regarding our business. Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that, subject to certain exceptions, any of our shares of stock (other than the share of Class C Common Stock of AGM Inc. (the \u201cClass C share\u201d)) held by a person or group (other than any member of the Apollo Group) that beneficially owns 20% or more of any class of stock then outstanding (other than the Class C share) cannot be voted on any matter and will not be considered to be outstanding when sending notices of a meeting of stockholders to vote on any matter (unless otherwise required by applicable law), calculating required votes, determining the presence of a quorum or for other similar purposes under our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws. Our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws also contain provisions limiting the ability of the holders of our Class A shares to call meetings and to influence the manner or direction of our management.\nIn addition, holders of the Preferred shares generally have no voting rights and have none of the voting rights given to holders of our Class A shares or Class B share, subject to certain exceptions.\nPotential conflicts of interest may arise among the Class C Stockholder and the holders of our Class A shares.\nOur Class C Stockholder, AGM Management, LLC, is owned and controlled indirectly by our Managing Partners. As a result, conflicts of interest may arise among the Class C Stockholder and its controlling persons, on the one hand, and us and/or the holders of our Class A shares, on the other hand.\nThe Class C Stockholder has the ability to influence our business and affairs through its ownership of the sole Class C share, which includes the ability to set the total number of directors serving on our board of directors and fill any vacancies or newly created directorships on our board of directors, and provisions under our Certificate of Incorporation requiring Class C Stockholder approval for certain corporate actions (in addition to approval by our board of directors). See \u201c-Certain actions by our board of directors require the approval of the Class C Stockholder, which is controlled by our Managing Partners.\u201d\nFurther, through its voting power with respect to the election of directors of our board of directors and its ability to set the total number of directors and fill any vacancies or newly created directorships on our board of directors, the Class C Stockholder has the ability to indirectly influence the determination of the amount and timing of the Apollo Operating Group entities\u2019 investments and dispositions, cash expenditures, including those relating to compensation, indebtedness, issuances of additional partner interests, tax liabilities and amounts of reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is available for distribution to holders of AOG Units.\nIn addition, conflicts may arise relating to the selection, structuring and disposition of investments and other transactions, declaring dividends and other distributions and other matters due to the fact that our Managing Partners and Contributing Partners indirectly hold AOG Units through the Apollo Operating Group and its subsidiaries, which are pass-through entities that are not subject to corporate income taxation.\nWe may from time to time undertake internal reorganizations that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOn September 5, 2019, we converted from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation. From time to time, we may undertake other internal reorganizations in an effort to simplify our organizational structure, streamline our operations or for other reasons. Additionally, on January 25, 2021, Leon Black informed us that he intends to ask the executive committee and our board of directors to evaluate revising our shareholder structure and board governance. Such internal reorganization may involve, among other things, the combination or dissolution of certain of our existing subsidiaries and the creation of new subsidiaries. Any such transactions could be disruptive to our business, result in significant expense, require regulatory approvals, and fail to result in the intended or expected benefits, any of which could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nControl by our Managing Partners of the combined voting power of our shares and holding their economic interests through the Apollo Operating Group may give rise to conflicts of interest.\nOur Managing Partners controlled 100% of the Class C Stockholder, and the Class C share represented 82.6% of the total voting power of the Class A shares, the Class B share and the Class C share, voting together as a single class, with respect to General Stockholder Matters as of December 31, 2020. Accordingly, our Managing Partners have the ability to control our management and affairs. In addition, through their control of our Class C Stockholder, they are able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval, except as otherwise provided in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws or required by the DGCL or the rules of the NYSE. The control of voting power by our Managing Partners could deprive Class A\nstockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their Class A shares as part of a sale of our company, and might ultimately affect the market price of the Class A shares.\nIn addition, our Managing Partners and Contributing Partners, through their beneficial ownership of partnership interests in Holdings, were entitled to 40.4% of Apollo Operating Group\u2019s economic returns through the AOG Units owned by Holdings as of December 31, 2020. Because they hold the majority of their economic interest in our businesses directly through the Apollo Operating Group, rather than through the issuer of the Class A shares, our Managing Partners and Contributing Partners may have conflicting interests with holders of Class A shares including relating to the selection, structuring, and disposition of investments and any decision to alter our structure. For example, our Managing Partners and Contributing Partners may have different tax positions from us, in part because our Managing Partners and Contributing Partners hold a significant portion of their AOG Units through entities that are not subject to corporate income taxation and we are subject to corporate income taxation. In addition, the earlier taxable disposition of assets following an exchange transaction by a Managing Partner or Contributing Partner may accelerate payments under the tax receivable agreement and increase the present value of such payments. Conversely, the taxable disposition of assets before an exchange or transaction by a Managing Partner or Contributing Partner may increase the tax liability of a Managing Partner or Contributing Partner without giving rise to any payment to such Managing Partner or Contributing Partner under the tax receivable agreement. For a description of the tax receivable agreement, see \u201cItem 13. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions-Amended and Restated Tax Receivable Agreement.\u201d Additionally, as a result of the lower corporate tax rate of 21%, there is a significant differential in tax rates that apply to us and our Managing Partners and Contributing Partners, which may influence when and to what extent the executive committee of our board of directors decides to cause the Apollo Operating Group to make distributions to Holdings, which is 100% beneficially owned, directly and indirectly, by our Managing Partners and our Contributing Partners, and the five intermediate holding companies, which are 100% owned by us. In addition, the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration the Managing Partners\u2019 and Contributing Partners\u2019 tax considerations even where no similar benefit would accrue to us.\nOur board of directors has delegated all of its powers and authority in the management of the business and affairs of the Company to an executive committee currently made up of our Managing Partners.\nExcept as otherwise provided in our certificate of incorporation and to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, our board of directors has delegated to a standing executive committee thereof all of the powers and authority of the board of directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Company. Such delegation may only be revoked by an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation. The current members of the executive committee are our Managing Partners.\nAdditionally, as directors, our Managing Partners have disproportionate voting power as compared to the other members of the board of directors, such that they control a majority of the votes on the board of directors. See \u201cItem 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance-Independence and Composition of Our Board of Directors.\u201d\nWe qualify for, and rely on, exceptions from certain corporate governance and other requirements under the rules of the NYSE.\nWe qualify for exceptions from certain corporate governance and other requirements under the rules of the NYSE. Pursuant to these exceptions, we may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements of the NYSE, including the requirements (i) that a majority of our board of directors consist of independent directors, (ii) that we have a nominating/corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors and (iii) that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors. Pursuant to the exceptions available to a controlled company under the rules of the NYSE, we have elected not to have a nominating and corporate governance committee comprised entirely of independent directors, nor a compensation committee comprised entirely of independent directors,. although we currently have a board of directors comprised of a majority of independent directors. Accordingly, you will not have the same protections afforded to equity holders of entities that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation states that the Class C Stockholder is under no obligation to consider the separate interests of the other stockholders and contains provisions limiting the liability of the Class C Stockholder.\nSubject to applicable law, our Certificate of Incorporation contains provisions limiting the duties owed by the Class C Stockholder. Our Certificate of Incorporation contains provisions stating that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Class C Stockholder is under no obligation to consider the separate interests of the other stockholders (including, without limitation, the tax consequences to such stockholders) in deciding whether or not to cause us to take (or decline to take) any actions as well as provisions stating that the Class C Stockholder shall not be liable to the other stockholders for monetary\ndamages for losses sustained, liabilities incurred or benefits not derived by such holders in connection with such decisions. See \u201c-Potential conflicts of interest may arise among the Class C Stockholder and the holders of our Class A shares.\u201d\nOther anti-takeover provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control.\nIn addition to the provisions described elsewhere in this report relating to the Class C Stockholder\u2019s control, other provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable by, for example:\n\u2022permitting our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022requiring advance notice for stockholder proposals and nominations if they are ever permitted by applicable law; and\n\u2022placing limitations on convening stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, certain provisions of Delaware law give us the ability to delay or prevent a transaction that could cause a change in our control. These provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control. The market price of our Class A shares and our Preferred shares could be adversely affected to the extent that such provisions discourage potential takeover attempts that our stockholders may favor.\nThe Class C Stockholder will not be liable to Apollo or holders of our Class A shares for any acts, or omissions unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment determining that the Class C Stockholder acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct and we have also agreed to indemnify the Class C Stockholder to a similar extent.\nEven if there is deemed to be a breach of the obligations set forth in our Certificate of Incorporation, our Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Class C Stockholder will not be liable to us or the holders of our Class A shares for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that the Class C Stockholder or its officers and directors acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct. These provisions are detrimental to the holders of our Class A shares because they restrict the remedies available to stockholders for actions of the Class C Stockholder.\nIn addition, we have agreed to indemnify AGM Management, LLC in its capacity as the former manager of Apollo Global Management, LLC and as the Class C Stockholder, its affiliates, any member, partner, Tax Matters Partner (as defined in the Code, as in effect prior to 2018), Partnership Representative (as defined in the Code), officer, director, employee agent, fiduciary or trustee of any of Apollo or its subsidiaries, the Class C Stockholder or any of our or the Class C Stockholder\u2019s affiliates and certain other specified persons (collectively, the \u201cIndemnitees\u201d), to the fullest extent permitted by law, against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements or other amounts incurred by any Indemnitee. We have agreed to provide this indemnification unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that the Indemnitee acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct. We have also agreed to provide this indemnification for criminal proceedings.\nCertain actions by our board of directors require the approval of the Class C Stockholder, which is controlled by our Managing Partners.\nAlthough the affirmative vote of a majority of our directors is required for any action to be taken by our board of directors, certain specified actions will also require the approval of the Class C Stockholder, which is controlled by our Managing Partners. These actions consist of the following:\n\u2022the entry into a debt financing arrangement by us in an amount in excess of 10% of our then existing long-term indebtedness (other than the entry into certain intercompany debt financing arrangements);\n\u2022the issuance by us or our subsidiaries of any securities that would (i) represent, after such issuance, or upon conversion, exchange or exercise, as the case may be, at least 5% on a fully diluted, as converted, exchanged or exercised basis, of any class of our or their equity securities or (ii) have designations, preferences, rights, priorities or powers that are more favorable than those of the Class A shares; provided, that no such approval shall be required for issuance of (x) securities that are issuable upon conversion, exchange or exercise of any securities that were issued and outstanding as of the effective date of our Certificate of Incorporation or (y) Class B share contemplated by Section 5.04 of our Certificate of Incorporation;\n\u2022the adoption by us of a stockholder rights plan;\n\u2022the amendment of our Certificate of Incorporation or our Bylaws;\n\u2022the exchange or disposition of all or substantially all of our assets in a single transaction or a series of related transactions;\n\u2022the merger, sale or other combination of the Company with or into any other person;\n\u2022the transfer, mortgage, pledge, hypothecation or grant of a security interest in all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries;\n\u2022the removal of an executive officer;\n\u2022the liquidation or dissolution of us; and\n\u2022the sale or other disposition of the Apollo Operating Group and/or its subsidiaries or any portion thereof, through a merger, recapitalization, stock sale, asset sale or otherwise, to an unaffiliated third party, or a borrowing to finance a direct or indirect distribution to BRH Holdings GP, Ltd. (\u201cBRH\u201d), in each case subject to certain exceptions.\nThe Class C Stockholder may transfer its Class C share to a third-party without stockholder consent, subject to certain restrictions set forth in our Certificate of Incorporation.\nThe Class C Stockholder may transfer its Class C share to a third-party in a merger or consolidation or in a transfer of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of our stockholders. The Class C Stockholder may only transfer all and not a portion of its Class C share to a permissible successor that is a member of the Apollo Group at any time by giving notice of such transfer in writing or by electronic transmission to our board of directors. Furthermore, at any time, the members of our Class C Stockholder may sell or transfer all or part of their membership interests in our Class C Stockholder without the approval of our stockholders. A new Class C Stockholder may not be willing or able to form new funds and could form funds that have investment objectives and governing terms that differ materially from those of our current funds. A new owner could also have a different investment philosophy, employ investment professionals who are less experienced, be unsuccessful in identifying investment opportunities or have a track record that is not as successful as Apollo\u2019s track record. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our funds could experience difficulty in making new investments, and the value of our funds\u2019 existing investments, our businesses, our results of operations and our financial condition could materially suffer.\nOur ability to pay regular dividends may be limited by our holding company structure. We are dependent on dividends from the Apollo Operating Group to pay dividends.\nAs a holding company, our ability to pay dividends will be subject to the ability of our subsidiaries to provide cash to us. We intend to make quarterly dividends to the holders of our Class A shares and our Preferred shares. Accordingly, we expect to cause the Apollo Operating Group to make dividends to its shareholders (Holdings, which is 100% beneficially owned, directly and indirectly, by our Managing Partners and our Contributing Partners, and the intermediate holding companies, which are 100% owned by us), pro rata in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay such dividends to the holders of our Class A shares and our Preferred shares; however, such dividends may not be made.\nThere may be circumstances under which we are restricted from paying dividends under applicable law or regulation (for example, due to Delaware limited partnership, DGCL or limited liability company act limitations on making dividends if liabilities of the entity after the dividend would exceed the value of the entity\u2019s assets).\nWe are required to pay our Managing Partners and Contributing Partners for most of the actual tax benefits we realize as a result of the tax basis step-up we receive in connection with our acquisitions of units from our Managing Partners and Contributing Partners.\nSubject to certain restrictions, each Managing Partner and Contributing Partner has the right to exchange the AOG Units that he holds through his partnership interest in Holdings for our Class A shares in a taxable transaction. These exchanges, as well as our acquisitions of units from our Managing Partners or Contributing Partners, may result in increases in the tax basis of the intangible assets of the Apollo Operating Group that otherwise would not have been available. Any such increases may reduce the amount of tax that Apollo Global Management, Inc., the parent of the consolidated group which includes APO Corp. and APO Asset Corp., wholly owned subsidiaries of Apollo Global Management, Inc., would otherwise be required to pay in the future.\nWe have entered into a tax receivable agreement with our Managing Partners and Contributing Partners that provides for the payment by Apollo Global Management, Inc., to our Managing Partners and Contributing Partners of 85% of the amount of actual tax savings, if any, that Apollo Global Management, Inc. realizes (or is deemed to realize in the case of an early termination payment by Apollo Global Management, Inc. or a change of control, as discussed below) as a result of these increases in tax deductions and tax basis and certain other tax benefits, including imputed interest expense, related to entering into the tax receivable agreement. Future payments that Apollo Global Management, Inc. may make to our Managing Partners and Contributing Partners could be material in amount.\nThe IRS could challenge our claim to any increase in the tax basis of the assets owned by the Apollo Operating Group that results from the exchanges entered into by the Managing Partners or Contributing Partners. The IRS could also challenge any additional tax depreciation and amortization deductions or other tax benefits (including deductions for imputed interest expense associated with payments made under the tax receivable agreement) we claim as a result of, or in connection with, such increases in the tax basis of such assets. If the IRS were to successfully challenge a tax basis increase or tax benefits we previously claimed from a tax basis increase, Holdings would not be obligated under the tax receivable agreement to reimburse Apollo Global Management, Inc. for any payments previously made to them (although any future payments would be adjusted to reflect the result of such challenge). As a result, in certain circumstances, payments could be made to our Managing Partners and Contributing Partners under the tax receivable agreement in excess of 85% of the actual aggregate cash tax savings of Apollo Global Management, Inc. Apollo Global Management, Inc.\u2019s ability to achieve benefits from any tax basis increase and the payments to be made under this agreement will depend upon a number of factors, including the timing and amount of its future income.\nIn addition, the tax receivable agreement provides that, upon a merger, asset sale or other form of business combination or certain other changes of control, Apollo Global Management, Inc.\u2019s (or its successor\u2019s) obligations with respect to exchanged or acquired units (whether exchanged or acquired before or after such change of control) would be based on certain assumptions, including that Apollo Global Management, Inc. would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement. See \u201cItem 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence-Amended and Restated Tax Receivable Agreement.\u201d\nOur Bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for certain legal actions between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a judicial forum viewed by the stockholders as more favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees, and the enforceability of the exclusive forum provision may be subject to uncertainty.\nArticle VII of the Bylaws provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for: (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers, other employees or stockholders to us or our stockholders or any current or former member or fiduciary of the Company to the Company or the Company\u2019s members; (c) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; or (d) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of (a) through (d) above, any claim as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the Bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The exclusive forum provision also provides that it will not apply to claims arising under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal securities laws for which there is exclusive federal or concurrent federal and state jurisdiction. Article VII provides that any person or entity who acquires or holds an interest in the capital stock of the Company will be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of Article VII. Stockholders cannot waive, and will not be deemed to have waived under the exclusive forum provision, the Company\u2019s compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Although we believe this exclusive forum provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies, this exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our\ndirectors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Further, in the event a court finds the exclusive forum provision contained in the Bylaws to be unenforceable or inapplicable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Taxation\nComprehensive U.S. federal income tax legislation became effective in 2018, which may adversely affect us.\nThe TCJA is the most comprehensive tax legislation passed in decades and contains many significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws. The exact impact of the TCJA for future years is difficult to quantify, but these changes could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In particular, the TCJA made various changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws that significantly impact the taxation of individuals, corporations and the taxation of taxpayers with overseas assets and operations. The TCJA, among other things, reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, limited the deductibility of net business interest expense for most businesses to 30% of \u201cadjusted taxable income\u201d (which is similar to EBITDA for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2022, and similar to EBIT for taxable years beginning thereafter), limited the deduction for net operating losses generated after 2017 to 80% of taxable income, eliminated the corporate alternative minimum tax, provided for immediate deductions for certain investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, changed the timing of certain income recognition, introduced a longer holding period requirement for performance fees to receive long-term capital gain treatment, denied dividends received deductions for hybrid dividends and certain interest or royalty deductions involving hybrid transactions or hybrid entities, created a new minimum tax on certain foreign income and combated base erosion in the U.S. through a new alternative tax.\nAlthough the reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, the immediate expensing of certain capital expenditures, and certain other changes introduced by the TCJA are expected to be beneficial to us and the portfolio companies of our funds, other changes introduced by the TCJA are expected to have an adverse effect. In particular, provisions addressing interest deductibility may limit the amount of interest expense that is deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes by certain of our funds\u2019 portfolio companies and thus increase taxes paid by such portfolio companies. In addition, the \u201cbase erosion and anti-abuse tax\u201d or \u201cBEAT,\u201d which imposed a minimum tax on certain entities that make significant deductible payments to related foreign entities may result in a material additional tax burden for certain portfolio companies owned by our funds and Athene, which may reduce cash flow and make these investments less valuable over time.\nOur effective tax rate and tax liability is based on the application of current income tax laws, regulations and treaties. These laws, regulations and treaties are complex, and the manner which they apply to us and our funds is sometimes open to interpretation. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. Although management believes its application of current laws, regulations and treaties to be correct and sustainable upon examination by the tax authorities, the tax authorities could challenge our interpretation resulting in additional tax liability or adjustment to our income tax provision that could increase our effective tax rate. Specifically, the IRS could challenge our claims to increases in the tax basis of assets in the Apollo Operating Group arising from our incorporation and from various tax elections that have been made in connection therewith. Further, we cannot predict how changes in the TCJA, regulations, technical corrections or other guidance issued under it or conforming or non-conforming state tax rules might affect us or our business or the business of our funds\u2019 portfolio companies. In addition, there can be no assurance that U.S. tax laws, including laws impacting the corporate income tax rate, will not change in the future. In addition, other changes could be enacted in the future to increase the corporate tax rate, limit further the deductibility of interest, subject carried interest to more onerous taxation or effect other changes that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. President Biden has provided some informal guidance on what tax law changes he would support. Among other things, his proposals would raise the rate on both domestic and foreign income and impose a new alternative minimum tax on book income. If these proposals are ultimately enacted into legislation, they could materially impact our tax provision, cash tax liability and effective tax rate.\nWe may hold or acquire certain investments in or through entities classified as PFICs or CFCs for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could adversely affect the value of your investment.\nCertain of our investments may be in foreign corporations or may be acquired through foreign subsidiaries that would be classified as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such entities may be passive foreign investment companies (\u201cPFICs\u201d) or controlled foreign corporations (\u201cCFCs\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For example, certain portfolio companies owned by our funds are considered to be CFCs for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, we may experience adverse U.S. tax consequences, including the recognition of taxable income prior to the receipt of cash relating to such income.\nIn addition, gain on the sale of a PFIC or CFC, including certain non-U.S. portfolio companies owned by our funds may be taxable at ordinary income tax rates, which may result in an increase of our overall tax burden and adversely affect the value of your investment.\nAs described above, the TCJA introduced a new minimum tax on \u201cGlobal Intangible Low-Taxed Income\u201d (\u201cGILTI\u201d) which may require us to pay tax at the highest rates applicable to ordinary income on our pro rata share of GILTI generated by certain CFCs that we own directly or indirectly prior to the receipt of cash relating to such income. Although we are still evaluating the new minimum tax imposed on GILTI and the full impact of such tax is unclear at this point, it is possible that we may be required to recognize income without the receipt of cash relating to such income.\nOur structure involves complex provisions of U.S. federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available. Our structure is also subject to on-going future potential legislative, judicial or administrative change and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.\nThe U.S. federal income tax treatment of our structure and transactions undertaken by us depends in some instances on determinations of fact and interpretations of complex provisions of U.S. federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available.\nYou should also be aware that the U.S. federal income tax rules are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, frequently resulting in revised interpretations of established concepts, statutory changes, revisions to regulations and other modifications and interpretations. It is possible that future legislation increases the U.S. federal income tax rates applicable to corporations again. No prediction can be made as to whether any particular proposed legislation will be enacted or, if enacted, what the specific provisions or the effective date of any such legislation would be, or whether it would have any effect on us. As such, we cannot assure you that future legislative, administrative or judicial developments will not result in an increase in the amount of U.S. tax payable by us, our funds, portfolio companies owned by our funds or by investors in our Class A shares. If any such developments occur, our business, results of operation and cash flows could be adversely affected and such developments could have an adverse effect on your investment in our Class A shares.\nChanges in U.S. and foreign tax law could adversely affect our ability to raise funds from certain investors.\nUnder the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (\u201cFATCA\u201d), certain U.S. withholding agents, or USWAs, foreign financial institutions (\u201cFFIs\u201d), and non-financial foreign entities (\u201cNFFEs\u201d), are required to report information about offshore accounts and investments to the U.S. or their local taxing authorities annually. In response to this legislation, various foreign governments have entered into Intergovernmental Agreements (\u201cIGAs\u201d), with the U.S. Government and some have enacted similar legislation.\nIn order to meet these regulatory obligations, Apollo is required to register FFIs with the IRS, evaluate internal FATCA procedures, expand the review of investor Anti-Money Laundering/Know Your Customer requirements and tax forms, evaluate the FATCA offerings by third-party administrators and ensure that Apollo is prepared for the new global tax and information reporting requirements.\nFurther, FATCA as well as Chapters 3 and 61 of the Code, require Apollo to collect new IRS Tax Forms (W-9 and W-8 series), and, in some cases, Cayman Self-Certifications and other supporting documentation from their investors. Similarly, the Common Reporting Standards (\u201cCRS\u201d) require Apollo to collect CRS Self-Certifications. Apollo has undertaken efforts to re-paper their pre-existing investors and new investors.\nFailure to meet these regulatory requirements could expose Apollo and/or its investors to a punitive withholding tax of 30% on certain U.S. payments and possibly limit their ability to open bank accounts and secure funding the global capital markets. As of 2019, a 30% withholding tax applies to the gross proceeds from the sale of U.S. stocks and securities. Proposed regulations were issued eliminating withholding on the payments of gross proceeds and further delaying the effective date of foreign pass-thru payment withholding, however aspects of these changes are uncertain and may be modified by regulations issued by the U.S. Treasury Department. The reporting obligations imposed under FATCA require FFIs to comply with agreements with the IRS to obtain and disclose information about certain investors to the IRS. The administrative and economic costs of compliance with FATCA may discourage some investors from investing in U.S. funds, which could adversely affect our ability to raise funds from these investors.\nOther countries, such as the U.K., Luxembourg, and the Cayman Islands, have implemented regimes similar to that of FATCA, and a growing number of countries have adopted (or are in process of introducing) similar legislation designed to provide increased transparency about our investors and their tax planning and profile. The OECD has also developed the CRS for exchange of information pursuant to which many countries have now signed multilateral agreements. As noted above, in the EU, a new mandatory exchange of information regime has been implemented under the DAC. The DAC, which effectively implements the CRS, requires EU member states to obtain detailed account information from financial institutions and exchange that information automatically with other jurisdictions annually. One or more of these information exchange regimes are likely to apply to our funds, and we may be obligated to collect and share with applicable taxing authorities information concerning investors in our funds (including identifying information and amounts of certain income allocable or distributable to them).Like FATCA, CRS imposes reporting obligations on Financial Institutions (\u201cFIs\u201d) not residents in the U.S., but CRS does not impose withholding tax obligations. Compliance with CRS and other similar regimes could result in increased administrative and compliance costs and could subject our investment entities to increased non-U.S. withholding taxes.\nInvestments in foreign countries and securities of issuers located outside of the U.S. may involve tax uncertainties and risks.\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) and other government agencies in jurisdictions where we and our affiliates invest or conduct business have continued to recommend and implement changes related to the taxation of multinational companies.\nOn October 5, 2015, the OECD published 13 final reports and an explanatory statement outlining consensus actions under the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (\u201cBEPS\u201d) project. This project involves a coordinated multijurisdictional approach to increase transparency and exchange of information in tax matters, and to address weaknesses of the international tax system that create opportunities for BEPS by multinational companies. The reports cover measures such as new minimum standards, the revision of existing standards, common approaches which will facilitate the convergence of national practices, and guidance drawing on best practices. The outcome of the BEPS project, including limiting interest deductibility, changes in transfer pricing, new rules around hybrid instruments or entities, and loss of eligibility for benefits of double tax treaties could increase tax uncertainty and impact the tax treatment of funds\u2019 earnings. This may adversely impact the investment returns of funds or limit future investment opportunities due to potential withholding tax leakage or non-resident capital gain taxes.\nImplementation into domestic legislation is not yet complete and may not be uniform across the participating states; certain actions give states options for implementation, certain actions are recommendations only and other jurisdictions may elect to only partially implement rules where it is in the state\u2019s interest. On November 24, 2016, the OECD published the text of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS, which is intended to expedite the interaction of the tax treaty changes of the BEPS project. Several of the proposed measures, including measures covering treaty abuse, the deductibility of interest expense, local nexus requirements, transfer pricing and hybrid mismatch arrangements are potentially relevant to some of our fund structures and could have an adverse tax impact on our funds, investors and/or our funds\u2019 portfolio companies. On June 7, 2017, the first wave of countries (68 in total) participated in the signing ceremony of the multilateral instrument (\u201cMLI\u201d). The MLI went into effect on July 1, 2018 with the intention to override and complement certain provisions in existing bilateral tax treaties. As of January 15, 2021, 95 countries have signed the MLI and 61 have ratified it. There are some important countries that have not yet signed including the U.S. and Brazil. As a result, uncertainty remains around the access to tax treaties for some of the investments\u2019 holding platforms, which could create situations of double taxation and adversely impact the investment returns of our funds.\nIt should be noted that Luxembourg opted for the application of a principal purpose test (\u201cPPT\u201d) clause being included in all the treaties in force as part of the anti-treaty abuse provisions (\u201cBEPS Action 6\u201d). The purpose of the PPT is essentially to deny treaty relief where it is broadly reasonable to conclude that obtaining the benefit of the treaty was one of the principal purposes of an arrangement or transaction leading to such benefit. Limitation on benefits (\u201cLOB\u201d) provisions have historically been used as anti-avoidance measures in tax treaties, and certain countries, including the U.S. and China, continue to opt for LOB provisions. The PPT will be a consideration for the relevant underlying countries, however, there is no current consistent interpretative view, thus posing a risk that our investment structures may be challenged and additional taxes and penalties imposed.\nIn addition, there are transfer pricing and standardized country by country (\u201cCbC\u201d) reporting requirements being implemented under the BEPS actions which may place additional administrative burden on our management team or portfolio company management and ultimately could lead to increased cost which could adversely affect profitability. For example, Luxembourg introduced additional transfer pricing regulations from January 1, 2017, that apply to intragroup financing activities and that are in line with the recommendations of the BEPS Action Plan. This has not significantly impacted our investments to date but has required some actions and adjustments in the structuring of our investments and in the maintenance\nand documentation thereof. Additional information from these sources and other documentation held by tax authorities is expected to be subject to greater information sharing under Automatic Exchange of Information provisions under BEPS and specific local arrangements such as the EU\u2019s automatic exchange of cross-border rulings directive, or the mandatory disclosure of certain cross-border transactions (\u201cDAC6\u201d).\nCountries including various EU countries have been moving forward on the BEPS agenda independent of agreement and finalization of the BEPS action items and certain European jurisdictions have adopted legislation affecting deductibility of interest and other financing expenses, local nexus requirements, transfer pricing and the treatment of hybrid entities and/or instruments.\nSimilarly, the U.K. introduced Anti-Hybrid provisions that came into effect on January 1, 2017. The scope of these rules is wide-reaching, in certain instances beyond the scope proposed by the BEPS initiative, and can apply to disallow certain payments or \u2018quasi-payments\u2019 for U.K. corporation tax purposes involving U.K. or non-U.K. hybrid entities. Where hybrid entities exist within a portfolio company structure, this may place additional administrative burden on our management team or portfolio company management to assess the impact of the rules and potentially create additional tax costs.\nThe European Union has taken steps to implement a consistent application of BEPS project type principles between EU member states through the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive 2016/1164 (\u201cATAD 1\u201d) and the Council Directive amending Directive (EU) 2016/1164 (\u201cATAD II\u201d) (together, \u201cthe ATAD rules\u201d). The ATAD rules may place additional administrative burden on our management team or portfolio company management to assess the impact of such rules on the investments of our funds and ultimately could lead to increased cost which could adversely affect profitability. The ATAD rules may also impact the investment returns of our funds.\nThe OECD is continuing with the BEPS project with proposals under Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 workstreams. These approaches go beyond the original measures from the 2015 reports and may have the effect of changing the way that the tax base for the Company and our and funds\u2019 investments is established. The impact for financial services businesses is currently unclear.\nThe European Union has taken further steps towards tax transparency DAC6. These rules (also known as the EU Mandatory Disclosure Rules (\u201cMDR\u201d)) may require taxpayers and their advisers to report on cross-border arrangements with an EU component that bear one of the proscribed hallmarks. The hallmarks are significantly broad such that a large volume of transactions within the financial services context may need to be disclosed. Failure to comply with disclosure obligations can result in fines and penalties. DAC6 may expose Apollo\u2019s investment activities to increased scrutiny from European tax authorities. Furthermore, many tax authorities are unfamiliar with asset management businesses and dealing with challenges from tax authorities reviewing such information may also place additional administrative burden on our management team or portfolio company management and ultimately could lead to increased cost which could adversely affect profitability.\nAs a result of the complexity of, and lack of clear precedent or authority with respect to, the application of various income tax laws to our structures, the application of rules governing how transactions and structures should be reported is also subject to differing interpretations. Certain jurisdictions where our funds have made investments, have sought to tax investment gains or other returns (including those from real estate) derived by nonresident investors, including private equity funds, from the disposition of the equity in companies operating in those jurisdictions. In some cases this development is the result of new legislation or changes in the interpretation of existing legislation and local authority assertions that investors have a local taxable presence or are holding companies for trading purposes rather than for capital purposes, or are not otherwise entitled to treaty benefits. In addition, the tax authorities in certain jurisdictions have sought to deny the benefits of income tax treaties for withholding taxes on interest and dividends of nonresident entities, if the entity is not the beneficial owner of the income but rather a mere conduit company inserted primarily to access treaty benefits.\nIn December 2018, the Cayman Islands Legislative Assembly passed The International Tax Co-Operation (Economic Substance) Law, 2018 (the \u201cCI Law\u201d) and the Bermuda House of Assembly passed a bill entitled the Economic Substance Act 2018 (the \u201cBermuda Act\u201d). As of January 1, 2019, the CI Law and the Bermuda Act requires every Cayman Islands or Bermuda relevant entity engaging in a relevant activity to maintain a substantial economic presence in the Cayman Islands or Bermuda. Outside of the BEPS agenda countries continue to develop their own domestic anti-avoidance provisions. Such provisions can be general or targeted in nature.\nIn many jurisdictions, there is an increasing political, legislative and regulatory focus on identifying the ultimate beneficial owners of corporate entities. The need to provide beneficial ownership information when forming new corporate entities or when seeking regulatory consents in relation to prospective transactions may in certain cases require the disclosure of\nadditional information relating to Apollo or its investors, and the need to obtain and verify such information may potentially have an impact on transaction costs and timelines.", "PERMNO": 12591, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "APO"}
