{"cik": "816956", "company": "CONMED CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities, including our common stock, involves a high degree of risk. Investors should carefully consider the specific factors set forth below as well as the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. See \u201cForward Looking Statements\u201d.\n(i) Risks Related to Our Business and the Medical Device Industry\nOur financial performance is dependent on conditions in the healthcare industry and the broader economy.\nThe results of our business are directly tied to the economic conditions in the healthcare industry and the broader economy as a whole. We will continue to monitor and manage the impact of the overall economic environment on the Company.\nIn this regard, approximately 18% of our revenues are derived from the sale of capital products. The sales of such products may be negatively impacted if hospitals and other healthcare providers are unable to secure the financing necessary to purchase these products or otherwise defer purchases.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic may pose significant risks to our business if the pandemic, and various government responses to it, continue for an extended period of time.\nThe public health actions undertaken to reduce the spread of the virus have created and may continue to create significant disruptions with respect to the demand for non-urgent surgeries in hospitals and surgery centers, hospital and ambulatory surgery center operating volumes, and potentially to our ability to adequately rely on our supply chain.\nAs of the date of this report:\n1.In some geographies or territories, our field-based sales representatives are limited in their ability to travel to service or call on customers, with in-person visits in many cases dependent on requests by physicians to cover surgeries, the policies of individual hospitals, surgery centers or other institutions, and the availability of appropriate personal protective equipment, testing or vaccines;\n2.Our office-based employees continue to work remotely, and\n3.Our manufacturing facilities and warehouses continue to operate with precautions, including increased hygiene and cleaning within facilities, social distancing, mandatory personal protective equipment and monitoring of temperatures.\nAs such, the COVID-19 pandemic has directly and indirectly adversely impacted the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results. The extent to which this will continue will depend on numerous evolving factors that are highly uncertain, rapidly changing and cannot be predicted with precision or certainty at this time, including:\n\u2022the duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, including any resurgence of the pandemic in some areas and the development of new strains, as well as the effectiveness of vaccines, and the extent to which they are distributed and administered;\n\u2022governmental, business and individual actions that have been, continue to be, or may in the future be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic including, for example, business and travel restrictions, \u201cstay-at-home\u201d and \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d directives, quarantines, and slowdowns, suspensions or delays of commercial activity;\n\u2022the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our partners and customers, including their ability to conduct surgeries, to continue to purchase our products, to pay for the products purchased from us and/or to collect reimbursement, or their ability to do so in the volumes that existed prior to the pandemic;\n\u2022the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and the governmental response on the budgets of our partners and customers;\n\u2022our ability during the COVID-19 pandemic to continue operations and/or adjust our production schedules in an efficient manner, as a result of current and anticipated weakened demand and/or production delays, if any, from our suppliers;\n\u2022significant reductions or volatility in demand for certain surgeries or for certain of our products;\n\u2022the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our supply chain\u2019s reliability and costs;\n\u2022costs incurred as a result of actions intended to protect the health and safety of our employees and continued operations, including enhanced cleaning processes and protocols designed to implement appropriate social distancing practices;\n\u2022our ability to comply with the financial covenants in our debt agreements if a material economic downturn as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic results in substantially increased indebtedness and/or lower earnings; and\n\u2022the exacerbation of negative impacts resulting from the occurrence of a global or national recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe have undertaken steps to reduce our spending and expenses in light of the uncertainty concerning forecasting demand, and consequently revenues. While we expect that we will be well positioned as surgeries return to their normalized levels, we are unable to predict with certainty how long the COVID-19 pandemic will last, or how severe its economic impact will be. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic and government responses thereto have subsided, residual economic and other effects may have an impact on the demand for post-pandemic surgery levels. If the downturn is more severe and prolonged than we currently expect, we may need to take further steps to reduce our costs, or to refinance our debt.\nOur financial performance may be adversely impacted by healthcare reform legislation.\nProvisions of healthcare legislation, including provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\") in the United States and any future federal healthcare legislation that may be passed, and similar attempts to reform or manage health care costs in other markets, could meaningfully change the way health care is developed and delivered and may adversely affect our business and results of operations. For example, the ACA includes provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs of Medicare, governing comparative effectiveness research, and implementing an independent payment advisory board and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies. We also face uncertainties that might result in the modification of health care laws or reimbursement in the United States and other markets. The uncertainty associated with\nmodifications could generally cause healthcare markets to be unstable and we could be subject to some interruptions, the magnitude of which cannot be determined.\nLimitations on the availability of Ethylene Oxide (\u201cEtO\u201d) sterilization services may limit our ability to sell certain sterile products.\nApproximately 33% of our products when measured in terms of revenues, are sterilized by third-party sterilizers using ethylene oxide, a chemical which, when present or used in high levels of concentrations, has raised some environmental concerns in some areas within the United States, with the result that some EtO sterilization facilities have closed, or are threatened with closure, either temporarily or permanently, in connection with government enforcement actions or enhanced regulations prompted by environmental concerns. We have been able to work to secure alternate EtO sterilization services to date, and do not currently expect sterilization availability to have a material impact on our business. If, however, there are further restrictions on capacity or further government actions adverse to EtO sterilization, it is possible that we could be impacted materially in the future.\nAs a manufacturer of medical devices that interacts with physicians and health care providers domestically and internationally, we face risks under domestic and foreign regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nManufacturers of medical devices have been the subject of various investigations or enforcement actions relating to interactions with health care providers domestically or internationally. The interactions with domestic health care providers are subject to regulations, known as the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Act and the False Claims Act, that generally govern incentives for health care providers, or methods of reimbursement funded in whole or in part by the government. Similarly, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), and similar foreign laws, prohibit certain conduct by manufacturers, generally described as bribery, with respect to interactions, either directly through foreign subsidiaries or indirectly through distributors, with health care providers who may be considered government officials because they are affiliated with public hospitals. The FCPA also imposes obligations on manufacturers listed on U.S. stock exchanges to maintain accurate books and records, and maintain internal accounting controls sufficient to provide assurance that transactions are accurately recorded, lawful and in accordance with management\u2019s authorization. The FCPA can pose unique challenges for manufacturers who operate in foreign cultures where conduct prohibited by the FCPA may not be viewed as illegal in local jurisdictions, and because, in some cases, a United States manufacturer may face risks under the FCPA based on the conduct of third parties over whom the manufacturer may not have complete control.\nIn this regard, from time to time, the Company may receive an information request or subpoena from a government agency, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, Department of Justice, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Department of Labor, the Treasury Department or other federal and state agencies or foreign governments or government agencies. Alternatively, employees or private parties may provide us with reports of alleged misconduct. These information requests or subpoenas may or may not be routine inquiries, or may begin as informal or routine inquiries and over time develop into investigations or enforcement actions of various types under the FCPA or otherwise. Similarly, the employee and third party reports may prompt us to conduct internal investigations into the alleged misconduct. As a medical device company, CONMED\u2019s operations and interactions with government hospitals, healthcare professionals and purchasers may be subject to various federal and state regulations, including the federal False Claims Act, which provides, in part, that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person or entity that it believes has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment to the government, or has made or used, or caused to be made or used, a false statement or false record material to a false claim. In addition, in certain circumstances, private parties may bring so-called Qui Tam claims as plaintiffs purportedly on behalf of the government asserting claims arising under the False Claims Act. A violation of the False Claims Act may result in fines up to $11,000 for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the government, and may also provide the basis for the imposition of administrative penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Many states have enacted false claims acts that are similar to the federal False Claims Act. No inquiry or claim that the Company currently faces or has faced to date, and no report of misconduct that the Company has received to date, has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. There can be no assurance, however, that any pending inquiries will not become investigations or enforcement actions, or the costs associated with responding to such inquiries, investigations, enforcement actions or investigations relating to reports of misconduct will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nFailure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in recalls, loss of revenues, fines or materially adverse implications.\nSubstantially all of our products are classified as class II medical devices subject to regulation by numerous agencies and legislative bodies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") and comparable international counterparts. As a manufacturer of medical devices, our manufacturing processes and facilities are subject to on-site inspection and continuing review by the FDA for compliance with the Quality System Regulations. We may have future inspections at our sites and there can be no assurance that the costs of responding to such inspections will not be material.\nManufacturing and sales of our products outside the United States are also subject to international regulatory requirements which vary from country to country. Moreover, we are generally required to obtain regulatory clearance or approval prior to marketing a new product. The time required to obtain approvals from foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance, and requirements for such approvals may differ from FDA requirements. Failure to comply with applicable domestic and/or foreign regulatory requirements may result in:\n\u2022fines or other enforcement actions;\n\u2022recall or seizure of products;\n\u2022total or partial suspension of production;\n\u2022loss of certification;\n\u2022withdrawal of existing product approvals or clearances;\n\u2022refusal to approve or clear new applications or notices;\n\u2022increased quality control costs; or\n\u2022criminal prosecution.\nIn addition to the Quality System Regulations, many of our products are also subject to industry-defined standards. We may not be able to comply with these regulations and standards due to deficiencies in component parts or our manufacturing processes. If we are not able to comply with the Quality System Regulations or industry-defined standards, we may not be able to fill customer orders and we may decide to cease production or sale of non-compliant products. Failure to produce products could affect our revenues, profit margins and could lead to loss of customers.\nOur products are subject to product recall and we have conducted product recalls in the past. Although no recall has had a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, we cannot assure you that regulatory issues will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in the future or that product recalls will not harm our reputation and our customer relationships.\nThe highly competitive market for our products may create adverse pricing pressures.\nThe market for our products is highly competitive and our customers have numerous alternatives of supply. Many of our competitors offer a range of products in areas other than those in which we compete, which may make such competitors more attractive to surgeons, hospitals, group purchasing organizations and others. In addition, many of our competitors are large, technically competent firms with substantial assets. Competitive pricing pressures or the introduction of new products by our competitors could have an adverse effect on our revenues. See \u201cProducts\u201d in Item 1 - Business for a further discussion of these competitive forces.\nFactors which may influence our customers\u2019 choice of competitor products include:\n\u2022changes in surgeon preferences;\n\u2022increases or decreases in healthcare spending related to medical devices;\n\u2022our inability to supply products to them as a result of product recall, market withdrawal or back-order;\n\u2022the introduction by competitors of new products or new features to existing products;\n\u2022the introduction by competitors of alternative surgical technology; and\n\u2022advances in surgical procedures, discoveries or developments in the healthcare industry.\nCost reduction efforts in the healthcare industry could put pressures on our prices and margins.\nIn recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs. Such efforts include national healthcare reform, trends towards managed care, cuts in Medicare reimbursement for procedures, consolidation of healthcare distribution companies and collective purchasing arrangements by GPOs and IDNs. Demand and prices for our products may be adversely affected by such trends.\nWe use a variety of raw materials in our businesses, and significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products.\nOur reliance on certain suppliers and commodity markets to secure raw materials used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of raw materials. In some instances, we participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations by suppliers. A disruption in deliveries from our suppliers, price increases or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. The increases in costs or availability of raw materials may be exacerbated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that our supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Nonetheless, price increases or the unavailability of some raw materials may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological change or to successfully develop new products with wide market acceptance, which could cause us to lose business to competitors.\nThe market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology. Our future financial performance will depend in part on our ability to develop and manufacture new products on a cost-effective basis, to introduce them to the market on a timely basis and to have them accepted by surgeons and other healthcare professionals.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technology or to develop viable new products. In addition, many of our competitors are substantially larger with greater financial resources which may allow them to more rapidly develop new products. Factors which may result in delays of new product introductions or cancellation of our plans to manufacture and market new products include:\n\u2022capital constraints;\n\u2022research and development delays;\n\u2022delays in securing regulatory approvals; and\n\u2022changes in the competitive landscape, including the emergence of alternative products or solutions which reduce or eliminate the markets for pending products.\nOrdering patterns of our customers may change resulting in reductions in sales.\nOur hospital and surgery center customers purchase our products in quantities sufficient to meet their anticipated demand. Likewise, our healthcare distributor customers purchase our products for ultimate resale to healthcare providers in quantities sufficient to meet the anticipated requirements of the distributors\u2019 customers. Should inventories of our products owned by our hospital, surgery center and distributor customers grow to levels higher than their requirements, our customers may reduce the ordering of products from us. This could result in reduced sales.\n(ii) Risks Related to Our Indebtedness\nThe terms of our indebtedness outstanding from time to time, including our senior credit agreement, may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.\nThe senior credit agreement contains, and future credit facilities are expected to contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to respond to changes in our business or competitive activities, or to otherwise engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022incur indebtedness;\n\u2022allow for liens to be placed on our assets;\n\u2022make investments;\n\u2022engage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022make certain restricted payments;\n\u2022enter into certain restrictive agreements;\n\u2022enter into certain swap agreements;\n\u2022change our line of business;\n\u2022pay dividends or make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock;\n\u2022consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022prepay and/or modify the terms of certain indebtedness; and\n\u2022pursue acquisitions.\nThese covenants, unless waived, may prevent us from pursuing acquisitions, significantly limit our operating and financial flexibility and limit our ability to respond to changes in our business or competitive activities. Our ability to comply with such provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. In the event of any default under our credit agreement, the credit agreement lenders may elect to declare all amounts borrowed under our credit agreement, together with accrued interest, to be due and payable. If we were unable to repay such borrowings, the credit agreement lenders could proceed against collateral securing the credit agreement which consists of substantially all of our property and assets. Our credit agreement also contains a material adverse effect clause which may limit our ability to access additional funding under our credit agreement should a material adverse change in our business occur.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, and, our leverage and debt service requirements may require us to adopt alternative business strategies.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $793.8 million of debt outstanding, representing 52% of total capitalization. We may not have sufficient cash flow available to enable us to meet our obligations. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, we will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include actions such as foregoing acquisitions, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness or seeking additional equity capital. We cannot assure you that any of these strategies could be implemented on terms acceptable to us, if at all. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d and Note 7.\nThe degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to investors, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022a portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to debt service and will not be available for operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends and other purposes;\n\u2022our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be limited or impaired or may be at higher interest rates;\n\u2022we may be at a competitive disadvantage when compared to competitors that are less leveraged;\n\u2022we may be hindered in our ability to adjust rapidly to market conditions;\n\u2022our degree of leverage could make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or other adverse circumstances applicable to us; and\n\u2022our interest expense could increase if interest rates in general increase because a portion of our borrowings, including our borrowings under our credit agreement, are and will continue to be at variable rates of interest.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our senior credit agreement are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. In the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.\nOur interest rates may be impacted by the phase out of LIBOR.\nLIBOR, the London Interbank Offered Rate, is the basic rate of interest used in lending transactions between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. Certain of the interest rates applicable to our sixth amended and restated senior credit agreement are calculated using LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if at that time LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. While our sixth amended and restated credit agreement includes provisions for establishing alternative reference rates in the event that LIBOR shall no longer be available or the determination is made to adopt an alternative reference rate, any such alternative reference rate could be higher and more volatile than LIBOR or may otherwise perform differently than LIBOR. The consequences of the adoption of any such alternative reference rates cannot be predicted at this time and may result in exposure to additional interest rate risk and increase the cost of indebtedness under our sixth amended and restated credit agreement.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.\nWe may incur substantial additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, we have $375.5 million of availability under the senior credit agreement. If we incur secured indebtedness and such secured indebtedness is either accelerated or becomes subject to a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, our assets would be used to satisfy obligations with respect to the indebtedness secured thereby before any payment could be made on the debt that is not similarly secured. If new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify. Our senior credit agreement restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, but if the facilities mature or are repaid, we may not be subject to such restrictions under the terms of any subsequent indebtedness.\nThe conditional conversion features of our 2.625% Convertible Notes due 2024 (the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d), if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition.\nIn the event the conditional conversion features of the Convertible Notes issued on January 29, 2019 are triggered, holders of the Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Convertible Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock, we would be required to make cash payments to satisfy all or a portion of our conversion obligation based on the conversion rate, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Convertible Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which could result in a material reduction of our net working capital. Refer to Item 7. Management and Discussion and Analysis - Financing Cash Flows and Note 7 for further details on the Convertible Notes.\nThe convertible notes hedge and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the offering of the Convertible Notes may affect the value of the Convertible Notes and our common stock.\nIn connection with the offering of the Convertible Notes, we entered into convertible notes hedge transactions with certain option counterparties (each an \u201cOption Counterparty\u201d). The convertible notes hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Convertible Notes, as the case may be. We also entered into warrant transactions with each Option Counterparty. The warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants, unless we elect to settle the warrants in cash. In connection with establishing its initial hedge of the convertible notes hedge and warrant transactions, each Option Counterparty or an affiliate thereof may have entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Convertible Notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of our common stock or the Convertible Notes at that time. In addition, each Option Counterparty or an affiliate thereof may modify its hedge position by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes (and is likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the Convertible Notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the Convertible Notes. In addition, if any such convertible notes hedge and warrant transactions fail to become effective, each Option Counterparty may unwind its hedge position with respect to our common stock, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock and the value of the Convertible Notes.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible notes hedge transactions.\nEach Option Counterparty to the convertible notes hedge transactions is a financial institution whose obligation to perform under the convertible notes hedge transaction will not be secured by any collateral. If an Option Counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with the Option Counterparty. Our exposure will generally correlate to the increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by an Option Counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. Although these counterparties are large, reputable U.S. financial institutions, we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any Option Counterparty.\n(iii) Risks Related to Our Acquisition Strategy\nOur financial performance is subject to the risks inherent in any acquisition, including the effects of increased borrowing and integration of newly acquired businesses or product lines.\nA key element of our business strategy has been to expand through acquisitions and we may seek to pursue additional acquisitions in the future. Our success in pursuing acquisitions depends on our ability to identify target companies or product lines that are available for sale, and, negotiating successful terms with the sellers, as the sellers may also be negotiating with other bidders with greater financial resources than we have. Even when we win a bid, our success is also dependent in part upon our ability to integrate acquired companies or product lines into our existing operations. We may not have sufficient management and other resources to accomplish the integration of our past and future acquisitions, which may strain our relationship with customers, suppliers, distributors, personnel or others. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and make acquisitions, or that we will be able to obtain financing for such acquisitions, on acceptable terms. In addition, while we are generally entitled to customary indemnification from sellers of businesses or coverage from representation and warranty insurance for any difficulties that may have arisen prior to our acquisition of each business, acquisitions may involve exposure to unknown liabilities and the amount and time for claiming under these indemnification provisions is often limited. As a result, our financial performance is now, and will continue to be, subject to various risks associated with the acquisition of businesses, including the financial effects associated with any increased borrowing required to fund such acquisitions or with the integration of such businesses.\nThe terms of any future preferred equity or debt financing may give holders of any preferred securities or debt securities rights that are senior to rights of our common shareholders or impose more stringent operating restrictions on our company.\nDebt or equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms. If we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of preferred stock or convertible securities, the terms of the debt or the preferred stock issued may give the holders rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. The terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations. If we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity, the ownership percentage of our existing shareholders would be diluted.\n(iv) Other Risks Related to Our Business\nWe could experience a failure of a key information technology system, process or site or a breach of information security, including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key information technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites or service providers, and could potentially become liable for a breach of various data privacy regulations.\nWe rely extensively on information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems for the storage, processing, and transmission of our electronic, business-related, information assets used in or necessary to conduct business. We leverage our internal IT infrastructures, and those of our business partners, to enable, sustain, and support our global business activities. In addition, we rely on networks and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third-parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. The data we store and process may include customer payment information, personal information concerning our employees, confidential financial information, and other types of sensitive business-related information. In limited instances, we may also come into possession of information related to patients of our physician customers. Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats pose potential risks to the security of our IT systems, networks and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. In addition, the laws and regulations governing security of data on IT systems and otherwise collected, processed, stored, transmitted, disclosed and disposed of by companies are evolving, adding another layer of complexity in the form of new requirements. We have made, and continue to make investments, seeking to address these threats, including monitoring of networks and systems, hiring of experts, employee training and security policies for employees and third-party providers. The techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time and difficult to anticipate by implementing adequate preventative measures.\nOur worldwide operations mean that we are subject to laws and regulations, including data protection and cybersecurity laws and regulations, in many jurisdictions. For example, the European Union (\"EU\") General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") requires us to manage personal data in the EU and may impose fines of up to four percent of our global revenue in the event of certain violations. Likewise, the California Consumer Privacy Act imposes obligations on companies that conduct business in California, and meet other requirements, with respect to the collection or sale of specified personal information. Other jurisdictions are also implementing or proposing a variety of data privacy laws and regulations. Further, there has been a developing trend of civil lawsuits and class actions relating to breaches of consumer data held by large companies or incidents\narising from other cyber-attacks. Any data security breaches, cyber-attacks, malicious intrusions or significant disruptions could result in actions by regulatory bodies and/or civil litigation, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation or competitive position.\nThe costs of attempting to protect IT systems and data may increase, and there can be no assurance that these added security efforts will prevent all breaches of our IT systems or thefts of our data. If our IT systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, we fail to comply with an applicable law or regulation, such as the GDPR, or we or one of our third-party providers suffer a loss or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to potential disruption in operations, loss of customers, reputational, competitive and business harm, and significant costs from remediation, litigation and regulatory actions.\nWe rely on a third party to obtain, process and distribute sports medicine allograft tissue. If such tissue cannot be obtained, is not accepted by the market or is not accepted under numerous government regulations, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nA portion of our orthopedic revenues relate to our share of the service fees from the MTF allograft tissues for which we have exclusive worldwide sales representation, marketing and promotion rights, as further described in our revenue recognition policy in Note 1. Our primary costs related to these revenues come from our commission expense and certain marketing costs. Our ability to increase the service fees may be constrained by certain factors which are outside of our control, such as the limited supply of donors and donated tissue that meets the quality standards of MTF. Similarly, under the terms of the agreement, MTF remains responsible for tissue procurement and processing, shipment of tissues and invoicing of service fees to customers. To the extent MTF\u2019s performance does not meet customer expectations or otherwise fails, CONMED may be unable to increase the allograft service fees or to find a suitable replacement for MTF on terms that are acceptable.\nThe FDA and several states have statutory authority to regulate allograft processing and allograft-based materials. The FDA could identify deficiencies in future inspections of MTF or MTF's suppliers or promulgate future regulatory rulings that could disrupt our business, reducing profitability.\nWe distribute some products for third-party companies, and cannot ensure that our rights to distribute such third-party products will continue indefinitely.\nWhile we generally own the products' designs and rights to the products we sell, in some cases we distribute products for third-parties. While these third-parties may have business reasons for contracting with us to distribute their products, we may face the risk that the third-parties may seek alternate distribution partners when their distribution contracts with us expire or are scheduled for renewal. If we lose the distribution rights to such products, we may not be able to find replacement products that are acceptable to our customers, or to us.\nIf we lose our patents or they are held to be invalid, or if our products or services infringe on third party patents, we could become subject to liability and our competitive position could be harmed.\nMuch of the technology used in the markets in which we compete is covered by patents. We have numerous U.S. patents and corresponding international patents on products expiring at various dates from 2021 through 2040 and have additional patent applications pending. See Item 1 Business \u201cResearch and Development\u201d and \u201cIntellectual Property\u201d for a further description of our patents. The loss of our patents could reduce the value of the related products and any related competitive advantage. Competitors may also be able to design around our patents and to compete effectively with our products. In addition, the cost of enforcing our patents against third parties and defending our products against patent infringement actions by others could be substantial, and we may not prevail.\nWhile we seek to take reasonable steps to avoid infringing on patents we do not own or license, we cannot be sure that our services and products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and we may have infringement claims asserted against us. These claims could cost us money, prevent us from offering some services or products, or damage our reputation. We cannot assure you that:\n\u2022pending patent applications will result in issued patents;\n\u2022patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged by competitors;\n\u2022our patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technology or provide us with a competitive advantage; or\n\u2022we will be successful in defending against pending or future patent infringement claims asserted against our products.\nWe can be sued for product liability claims and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover the nature and amount of any product liability claims.\nEven if our products are properly designed and perform as intended, we may be sued. The nature of our products as medical devices, and the litigious environment, should be regarded as potential risks which could significantly and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The insurance we maintain to protect against claims associated with the use of our products has deductibles and may not adequately cover the amount or nature of any claim asserted against us. We are also exposed to the risk that our insurers may become insolvent or that premiums may increase substantially. See \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d for a further discussion of the risk of product liability actions and our insurance coverage.\nDamage to our physical properties as a result of windstorm, earthquake, fire or other natural or man-made disaster may cause a financial loss and a loss of customers.\nAlthough we maintain insurance coverage for physical damage to our property and the resultant losses that could occur during a business interruption, we are required to pay deductibles and our insurance coverage is limited to certain caps. For example, our deductible for windstorm damage to our Florida property amounts to 2% of any loss. Any increase in the frequency or severity of natural disaster events could result in increased insurance premiums.\nFurther, while insurance reimburses us for our lost gross earnings during a business interruption, if we are unable to supply our customers with our products for an extended period of time, there can be no assurance that we will regain the customers\u2019 business once the product supply is returned to normal.\nOur significant international operations subject us to foreign currency fluctuations and other risks associated with operating in countries outside the United States.\nA significant portion of our revenues, approximately 44% of 2020 consolidated net sales, were to customers outside the United States. We have sales subsidiaries in a significant number of countries in Europe as well as Australia, Canada, China, Japan and Korea. In those countries in which we have a direct presence, our sales are denominated in the local currency and those sales denominated in local currency amounted to approximately 34% of our total net sales in 2020. The remaining 10% of sales to customers outside the United States was on an export basis and transacted in United States dollars.\nBecause a significant portion of our operations consist of sales activities in jurisdictions outside the United States, our financial results may be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the markets in which we distribute products. While we have implemented a hedging strategy involving foreign currency forward contracts for 2020, our revenues and earnings are only partially protected from foreign currency translation if the United States dollar strengthens as compared with currencies such as the Euro. Further, as of the date of this Form 10-K, we have not entered into any foreign currency forward contracts beyond 2022. Our international presence exposes us to certain other inherent risks, including:\n\u2022imposition of limitations on conversions of foreign currencies into dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by international subsidiaries;\n\u2022imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by international subsidiaries;\n\u2022trade barriers and tariffs;\n\u2022compliance with economic sanctions, trade embargoes, export controls, and the customs laws and regulations of the many countries in which we operate;\n\u2022political risks, including political instability;\n\u2022reliance on third parties to distribute our products;\n\u2022hyperinflation in certain countries outside the United States; and\n\u2022imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments.\nWe cannot assure you that such risks will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur new products may fail to achieve expected levels of market acceptance.\nNew product introductions may fail to achieve market acceptance. The degree of market acceptance for any of our products will depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\u2022our ability to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements in the time frames we currently estimate;\n\u2022our ability to successfully implement new technologies;\n\u2022the market\u2019s readiness to accept new products;\n\u2022having adequate financial and technological resources for future product development and promotion;\n\u2022the efficacy of our products; and\n\u2022the prices of our products compared to the prices of our competitors\u2019 products.\nIf our new products do not achieve market acceptance, we may be unable to recover our investments and may lose business to competitors.\nIn addition, some of the companies with which we now compete, or may compete in the future, have or may have more extensive research, marketing and manufacturing capabilities and significantly greater technical and personnel resources than we do, and may be better positioned to continue to improve their technology in order to compete in an evolving industry. See \u201cProducts\u201d in Item 1 - Business for a further discussion of these competitive forces.\nOur Board of Directors may, in the future, limit or discontinue payment of a dividend on common stock.\nWe have paid a quarterly dividend to our shareholders since 2012. However, we may not pay such dividends in the future at the prior rate, or at all. All decisions regarding our payment of dividends will be made by our Board of Directors from time to time, and are subject to an evaluation of our financial condition, results of operations and capital requirements, applicable law, industry practice, contractual restraints and other business considerations. In addition, our senior credit agreement may restrict our ability to pay dividends, and the terms of agreements governing debt that we may incur in the future may also limit or prohibit dividend payments. We may not have sufficient surplus or net profits under Delaware law to be able to pay any dividends, which may result from extraordinary cash expenses, actual expenses exceeding contemplated costs, funding of capital expenditures or increases in reserves.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable. These provisions include:\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without shareholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022the requirement that a special meeting of shareholders may be called only by the board of directors, the chair of the board of directors, the president, or stockholders holding at least 25% of our outstanding stock (subject to certain procedural and informational requirements), which may delay the ability of our shareholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action;\n\u2022the procedural safeguards in place in connection with stockholder action by written consent, including a requirement that stockholders of at least 25% of our outstanding common stock request that the board of directors set a record date to determine the stockholders entitled to act by written consent;\n\u2022providing indemnification and exculpation rights to our directors and officers;\n\u2022advance notice procedures that shareholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a shareholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us; and\n\u2022exclusive forum provisions, including provisions providing for the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for bringing certain actions.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which provides that we may not engage in a business combination, such as a merger, consolidation, recapitalization, asset sale or disposition of stock, with any \"interested stockholder\" for a period of three years from the date that the interested stockholder first became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met.\nAny provision of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our shareholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations and climate change initiatives could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business and facilities and those of our suppliers are subject to a number of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations governing the protection of human health and the environment. In addition, concern over climate change and sustainability has led to foreign and domestic legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. A failure to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations could result in fines or penalties. Any such expenses or liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to our success.\nCONMED\u2019s employees are its most important resource, and in many areas of the medical industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. CONMED seeks to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain and motivate its existing employees. If we are unable to continue to attract or retain qualified employees, including our executives, CONMED\u2019s performance, including its competitive position, could be materially and adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 11547, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "CNMD"}
