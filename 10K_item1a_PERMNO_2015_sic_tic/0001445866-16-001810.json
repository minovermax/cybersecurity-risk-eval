{"cik": "1494582", "company": "BOSTON OMAHA Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in shares of our common stock is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider all of the risks discussed below, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report. If any of the following risks develop into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE COMPANY AND OUR BUSINESS\nWe face early stage risks and other risks we have not yet identified.\nWe have a limited operating history. As a company in the early stages of its new business strategy and under new management, we may experience under-capitalization, cash shortages, setbacks in employee recruitment or acquisitions for growth opportunities, and other risks common to emerging businesses. No assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully implement any or all of our business plan, or if implemented, that we will accomplish the desired objectives of operation, expansion or creation of additional revenues and earnings.\nWe are reliant on the success of our expansion plans.\nOur growth strategy depends to a significant degree upon our ability to successfully acquire, develop and profitably operate new businesses, in both the outdoor billboard and insurance industries and in other industries and markets which we may choose to enter. The successful acquisition and development of new businesses will depend on a number of factors, including the identification and availability of suitable assets, businesses or acquisition candidates, the determination of new industries in which to expand, the availability of adequate financing, the hiring, training and retention of qualified employees, the ability of management to effectively control the expansion process, and other factors, some or all of which may be beyond our control. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement our growth strategy, to acquire new businesses on a timely and cost-efficient basis or to operate our new businesses profitably. If the expected operating efficiencies from such transactions do not materialize, if we fail to integrate new businesses into our existing portfolio, or if the costs of such integration exceed expectations, our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nIf future acquisitions do not achieve sufficient profitability relative to expenses and investment, our business and ability to finance our operations could be materially adversely affected.\nA key element of our growth strategy is the acquisition or development of other related businesses. The potential negotiation of future acquisitions could require us to incur significant costs and expose us to significant risks, including:\n*\nrisks relating to the condition of assets acquired and exposure to residual liabilities of prior businesses;\n*\noperating risks, including equipment, technology and supply problems, regulatory requirements and approvals necessary for acquisitions;\n*\nrisks that potential acquisitions may require the disproportionate attention of our senior management, which could distract them from the management of our existing businesses;\n*\nrisks related to our ability to retain experienced personnel of the acquired company; and\n*\nrisks that certain acquisitions may require regulatory approvals, which could be refused or delayed and which could result in unforeseen regulatory expenses or unfavorable regulatory conditions.\nThese issues could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to finance our operations. The businesses and other assets we acquire in the future may not achieve sufficient revenue or profitability to justify our investment, and any difficulties we may encounter in the integration process could interfere with our operations and reduce operating margins. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuance of our equity securities, incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and fluctuations in quarterly results and expenses.\nIncreased operating expenses associated with the expansion of our business may negatively impact our operating income.\nIncreased operating expenses associated with any expansion of our business may negatively impact our income as we, among other things:\n*\nseek to acquire related businesses;\n*\nexpand geographically;\n*\nmake significant capital expenditures to support our ability to provide services in our existing businesses; and\n*\nincur increased general and administrative expenses as we grow.\nAs a result of these factors, we may not achieve, sustain or increase our profitability on an ongoing basis.\nWe have limited experience in acquiring other companies and businesses, and we may have difficulty integrating the operations of companies or businesses that we may acquire and may incur substantial costs in connection therewith.\nA significant component of our growth strategy is the acquisition of other operations. Our experience acquiring companies has been relatively limited to date. We have evaluated, and expect to continue to evaluate, a wide array of potential strategic transactions. From time to time, we may engage in discussions regarding potential acquisitions. The costs and benefits of future acquisitions are uncertain. Any of these transactions could be material to our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the process of integrating the operations of an acquired company may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The key areas where we may face risks and uncertainties include:\n*\nthe need to implement or remediate appropriate controls, procedures and policies at companies that, prior to the acquisition, lacked these controls, procedures and policies;\n*\ndisruption of ongoing business, diversion of resources and of management time and focus from operating our business to acquisitions and integration challenges;\n*\nour ability to achieve anticipated benefits of acquisitions by successfully marketing the service offerings of acquired businesses to our existing partners and customers, or by successfully marketing our existing service offerings to customers and partners of acquired businesses;\n*\nthe negative impact of acquisitions on our results of operations as a result of large one-time charges, substantial debt or liabilities acquired or incurred, amortization or write down of amounts related to deferred compensation, goodwill and other intangible assets, or adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges;\n*\nthe need to ensure that we comply with all regulatory requirements in connection with and following the completion of acquisitions;\n*\nthe possibility of acquiring unknown or unanticipated contingencies or liabilities;\n*\nretaining employees and clients and otherwise preserving the value of the assets of the businesses we acquire; and\n*\nthe need to integrate each acquired business's accounting, information technology, human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management.\nIf we identify appropriate acquisition targets, we may be unable to acquire businesses on terms that we consider acceptable due to a variety of factors, including competition from other strategic buyers or financial buyers. Furthermore, in order to achieve the growth we seek, we may acquire numerous smaller market participants, which could require significant attention from management and increase risks, costs and uncertainties associated with integration.\nWe may need a significant amount of additional capital, which could substantially dilute your investment.\nWe may need significant additional capital in the future to continue our planned operations. No assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain such funds upon favorable terms and conditions, if at all. Failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions that may include voting rights (including the right to vote as a series on particular matters), preferences as to dividends and liquidation, and conversion and redemption rights, subject to applicable law, and at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time.\nSuch issuances and the exercise of any convertible securities will dilute the percentage ownership of our stockholders, and may affect the value of our capital stock and could adversely affect the rights of the holders of such stock, thereby reducing the value of such stock. Moreover, any exercise of convertible securities may adversely affect the terms upon which we will be able to obtain additional equity capital, since the holders of such convertible securities can be expected to exercise them at a time when we would, in all likelihood, be able to obtain any needed capital on terms more favorable to us than those provided in such convertible securities.\nIf we sell shares or other equity securities in one or more other transactions, or issue stock or stock options pursuant to any future employee equity incentive plan, investors may be materially diluted by such subsequent issuances.\nWe face intense competition, including competition from companies with significantly greater resources than us, and if we are unable to compete effectively with these companies, our market share may decline and our business could be harmed.\nThe outdoor billboard industry is highly competitive and there is a concentration in the ownership of billboards in the geographic markets in which we compete. Further, new competitors may regularly enter the market. Any additional industries or markets that we may enter through future acquisitions will also likely be occupied by established competitors. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, product development and human resources than us. Accordingly, even if there is a large market for our products and services in the industries in which we compete, there can be no assurance that our products and services will be purchased by consumers at a rate sufficient for us to achieve our growth objectives.\nOur management recognizes that we will, therefore, be forced to compete primarily on the basis of price, performance, service, and other factors. Our management believes that our ability to achieve sustained profitability will depend primarily on our ability to consummate acquisitions of assets and businesses in competitive markets, skillfully allocate capital, and establish brand recognition and customer allegiance in each of our businesses. This approach requires that our management perform at a high level and is fraught with risks, many of which are beyond our control or ability to foresee.\nIf actual insurance claims exceed our claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or if changes in the estimated level of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are necessary, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\nAs we establish our insurance operations, we will be establishing claims and claims adjustment expense reserves. These reserves will not represent an exact calculation of liability, but instead will represent management estimates of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost, generally utilizing actuarial expertise and projection techniques, at a given accounting date.\nThe process of estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. These variables can be affected by both internal and external events, such as: changes in claims handling procedures; adverse changes in loss cost trends, including inflationary pressures; economic conditions including general inflation; legal trends and legislative changes; and varying judgments and viewpoints of the individuals involved in the estimation process, among others. The impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses will be difficult to estimate. We also expect that claims and claim adjustment expense reserve estimation difficulties will also differ significantly by product line due to differences in claim complexity, the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of occurrence date for a claim and reporting lags (the time between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer).\nThe estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves may also be more difficult during times of adverse or uncertain economic conditions due to unexpected changes in behavior of claimants and policyholders, including an increase in fraudulent reporting of exposures and/or losses, reduced maintenance of insured properties, increased frequency of small claims or delays in the reporting of claims.\nWe will attempt to consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are established or reviewed. Due to the recent establishment of our insurance subsidiary and the inherent uncertainty underlying claims and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates, the final resolution of the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses will likely be higher or lower than the related claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at the reporting date. Therefore, actual paid losses in the future may yield a materially different amount than will be currently reserved.\nBecause of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities resulting from one insured event, or an accumulation of insured events, may exceed the current related reserves. In addition, our estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. These additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and/or our financial position.\nOur efforts to develop new products or expand in targeted markets may not be successful and may create enhanced risks.\nA number of our planned business initiatives in the insurance markets we intend to serve will involve developing new products or expanding existing products in targeted markets. This includes the following efforts, from time to time, to protect or grow market share:\n*\nWe may develop products that insure risks we have not previously insured, contain new coverage or coverage terms or contain different commission terms.\n*\nWe may refine our underwriting processes.\n*\nWe may seek to expand distribution channels.\n*\nWe may focus on geographic markets within or outside of the United States where we have had relatively little or no market share.\nWe may not be successful in introducing new products or expanding in targeted markets and, even if we are successful, these efforts may create enhanced risks. Among other risks:\n*\nDemand for new products or in new markets may not meet our expectations.\n*\nTo the extent we are able to market new products or expand in new markets, our risk exposures may change, and the data and models we use to manage such exposures may not be as sophisticated or effective as those we use in existing markets or with existing products. This, in turn, could lead to losses in excess of our expectations.\n*\nModels underlying underwriting and pricing decisions may not be effective.\n*\nEfforts to develop new products or markets have the potential to create or increase distribution channel conflict.\n*\nTo develop new products or markets, we may need to make substantial capital and operating expenditures, which may also negatively impact results in the near term.\nIf our efforts to develop new products or expand in targeted markets are not successful, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may lack operational control over certain companies in which we invest.\nWe have made, and may continue to make, certain strategic investments in various businesses without acquiring all or a majority ownership stake in those businesses. To the extent that such investments represent a minority or passive stake in any business, we may have little to no participation, input or control over the management, policies, and operations of such business. Further, we may lack sufficient ownership of voting securities to impact, without the vote of additional equity holders, any matters submitted to shareholders or members of such business for a vote.\nThere is inherent risk in making minority equity investments into companies over which we have little to no control. Without control of the management and decision-making of these businesses, we cannot control their direction, strategy, policies and business plans, and we may be powerless to improve any declines in their performance, operating results and financial condition. If any company in which we are a minority investor suffers adverse effects, it may not be able to continue as a going business concern, and we may lose our entire investment.\nGovernmental regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur billboard businesses are regulated by governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These regulations could limit our growth by putting constraints on the number, location and timing of billboards we wish to erect. New regulations and changes to existing regulations may also curtail our ability to expand our billboard business and adversely affect us by reducing our revenues or increasing our operating expenses.\nWe will also be subject to maintaining compliance within the highly regulated insurance industry as we continue our pursuit of opportunities in that market, including the maintenance of certain levels of operating capital and reserves. Changes to the regulatory environment in the insurance industry may cause us to adjust our views or practices regarding regulatory risk management, and necessitate changes to our operations that may limit our growth or have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, certain of the other new markets and industries that we may choose to enter may be regulated by a variety of federal, state and local agencies.\nOur insurance business is a startup business, and no assurance can be given that we can successfully achieve demand for our products and services and achieve profitability.\nOur insurance business has yet to commence sales and we do not know when it may expect to realize revenues. There is no certainty that our products and services will achieve market acceptance or that we will achieve profitability. Commercial relationships must be developed with other market participants to deliver our insurance products and services to market, which cannot be guaranteed to be consummated in a timely fashion, if at all.\nWe are dependent upon our key personnel.\nOur ability to develop, expand and maintain a competitive position in light of market developments will depend, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. The successful operation of our business acquisitions is tied to our hiring of key operations managers, salespeople and other employees that are both experienced in the relevant industry and located in the geographic locations into which we wish to expand. Further, we rely greatly on our executive management team to determine our business strategy, select appropriate targets for expansion and acquisition, and manage our overall portfolio of businesses. Competition for such personnel is substantial, and no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to attract and retain such personnel. The Company's Co-Chief Executive Officers, Adam K. Peterson and Alex B. Rozek, are each managing members of separate investment management entities, which are each major shareholders of our company. While we have deemed that the outside business endeavors of our management team do not currently constitute a conflict of interest, it is possible that a conflict of interest could arise between the performance of our executive management team and their roles as managing members of entities which together own a majority of our outstanding capital stock. Such conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nAdverse economic conditions could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations are sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer and commercial spending, including discretionary spending. Future economic conditions such as employment levels, business conditions, interest rates and tax rates could reduce our revenues. A general reduction in the level of business activity could adversely affect our financial condition and/or results of operations.\nDisruptions or similar problems could increase our expenses.\nA natural disaster (such as an earthquake, fire or flood) or an act of terrorism could cause substantial delays in our operations, damage or destroy our equipment or facilities and cause us to incur additional expenses and lose revenue. The insurance we maintain against natural disasters may not be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case, which would require us to expend significant resources to replace any destroyed assets, thereby materially and adversely affecting our financial condition and prospects.\nCash and cash equivalents represent one of our largest assets and we may be at risk of being uninsured for a large portion of such assets.\nAs of February 29, 2016, we had approximately $29,296,891 in cash and cash equivalents with a single large financial banking institution. At times, our cash and cash equivalents may be uninsured or in deposit accounts that exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") insurance limits. If the institution at which we have placed our funds were to become insolvent or fail, we could be at risk for losing a substantial portion of our cash deposits, or incur significant time delays in obtaining access to such funds. In light of the limited amount of federal insurance for deposits, even if we were to spread our cash assets among several institutions, we would remain at risk for the amount not covered by insurance.\nWe are subject to extensive financial reporting and related requirements for which our accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared.\nWe are subject to reporting and other obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 requires us to conduct an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. These reporting and other obligations place significant demands on our management, administrative, operational and accounting resources. In order to comply with these requirements, we may need to (i) upgrade our systems, (ii) implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures, (iii) implement an internal audit function, and (iv) hire additional accounting, internal audit and finance staff. If we are unable to accomplish these objectives in a timely and effective manner, our ability to comply with our financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies could be impaired. Any failure to maintain effective internal controls could have a negative impact on our ability to manage our business and on our stock price.\nWe may be at risk to accurately report financial results or detect fraud if we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls.\nAs directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report that contains an assessment by management on the Company's internal control over financial reporting in their annual and quarterly reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q. While we are consistently working on improvements and conducting rigorous reviews of our internal controls over financial reporting, our independent auditors may interpret Section 404 requirements and apply related rules and regulations differently. We are a smaller reporting company not currently subject to having our outside auditors attest to our internal controls. When we do become subject to these requirements, if our independent auditors are not satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or with the level at which it is documented, operated or reviewed, they may decline to accept management's assessment and not provide an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. Additionally, if we are not able to meet all the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities such as the SEC. We cannot assure you that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting will be identified in the future. Also, future changes in our accounting, financial reporting, and regulatory environment may create new areas of risk exposure. Failure to adequately implement our existing control environment accordingly may impair our controls over financial reporting and cause our investors to lose confidence in the reliability of our financial reporting which may adversely affect our stock price.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nInvestors should not rely on the accuracy of forward-looking statements made by us.\nTo the extent that we or any of our officers were to provide any projections, financial forecasts, or other forward-looking statements to investors, investors must recognize that any such forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions and estimates. We cannot make any representations as to the accuracy and reasonableness of such assumptions or the forward-looking statements based thereon. The validity and accuracy of those forward-looking statements will depend in large part on future events that we cannot foresee, and may or may not prove to be correct. Consequently, there can be no assurance that our actual operating results will correspond to any of the projections or forecasts. Accordingly, an investment in our company should not be made in reliance on projections or forecasts prepared by us.\nNo market currently exists for the sale or resale of any common stock that you purchase, and there are limitations on transferability.\nNo public market for any of our securities currently exists. A recognized market for our securities may never develop and you therefore may not be able to liquidate your investment. The securities we are offering in the 2016 Financing are \"restricted securities\" as that term is used in federal securities laws and have not been registered under the Securities Act. The securities are being offered in reliance upon an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, are not eligible for sale in the public market, and are subject to applicable resale restrictions under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 144. Therefore, the purchase of our common stock should be considered a long-term investment, as investors may be unable to liquidate the investment and should be prepared to bear the economic risk of such investment for an indefinite period. Because our common stock is not registered under the Securities Act, and has been issued pursuant to exemptions from registration, our common stock may not be resold by the holders thereof in the absence of an effective registration under the Securities Act, or an opinion of counsel satisfactory to us that such registration is not required.\nWe do not know whether a public market will develop for our common stock, and public registration of our common stock may create a variety of risks.\nThere is no public trading market for our common stock. In connection with the 2016 Financing, we intend to apply to have our common stock listed on the OTCQX or another trading exchange and there can be no assurance that our listing will be accepted. This listing, if approved, may give rise to certain risks, including the following:\n* If a market for our common stock does not develop or is not sustained, it may be difficult for you to sell your common stock at an attractive price or at all. We cannot predict the prices at which our common stock will trade.\n* Since our common stock could be thinly traded, its trading price is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to extreme fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. Such factors include, without limitation, the trading volume of our shares; the number of securities analysts, market-makers and brokers following our common stock; new products or services introduced or announced by us or our competitors; actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results; conditions or trends in our business industries; announcements by us of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; additions or departures of key personnel; sales of our common stock; and general stock market price and volume fluctuations of publicly-traded, and particularly microcap, companies. Investors may have difficulty reselling our common stock, either at or above the price they paid for our stock, or even at fair market value. The stock markets often experience significant price and volume changes that are not related to the operating performance of individual companies, and because our common stock could be thinly traded it is particularly susceptible to such changes. These broad market changes may cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of how well we perform as a company. In addition, there is a history of securities class action litigation following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities. Although there is no such litigation currently pending or threatened against us, such a suit against us could result in the incursion of substantial legal fees, potential liabilities and the diversion of management's attention and resources from our business.\n* The market price for the common stock may be significantly affected by factors such as variations in quarterly and yearly operating results, general trends in the industries in which we operate, and changes in state or federal regulations affecting us and our industries. Furthermore, in recent years the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies. Such broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our stock, if a market for it develops, and the market price of our stock may be similarly volatile and subject to such wide fluctuations.\n* Our business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition could be materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. A wide variety of factors continue to impact economic conditions and consumer confidence. These factors include, among others, concerns over the pace of economic growth in the U.S., continued low interest rates, the U.S. Federal Reserve's plans to further raise short-term interest rates, the strength of the U.S. Dollar, global economic factors including quantitative easing or similar programs by the European Central Bank, the potential breakup of the European Union resulting from the exit by one or more member states, the recent slowdown and resulting economic turmoil in China, volatile energy costs, and domestic and geopolitical issues, as well as government interpretations and actions changing the regulatory environment and the tax system under which we operate. Certain of these factors could have an adverse effect on us. Our revenues may decline, our profit margins could erode and we could incur significant losses.\n* We may provide public guidance on our expected operating and financial results for future periods. Any such guidance will be comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties as described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public filings and public statements. Whether or not we provide guidance, investment analysts may publish their estimates of our future financial performance. Our actual results may not always be in line with or exceed any guidance we have provided or the expectations of investment analysts, especially in times of economic uncertainty. If, in the future, our operating or financial results for a particular period do not meet any guidance we provide or the expectations of investment analysts or if we or investment analysts reduce estimates of our performance for future periods, the market price of our common stock may decline.\n* Volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent investors from being able to sell their common stock at or above the price paid for their shares. As a result, our stockholders may suffer a loss on their investment.\n* Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares.\n* We are an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, (i) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and (iii) exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and of shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we elect to take advantage of these exemptions and as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. In addition, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We may take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.\n* Our common stock is deemed to be \"penny stock\" as that term is defined in Regulation Section 240.3a51-1 of the SEC. Penny stocks are stocks: (a) with a price of less than $5.00 per share; (b) that are not traded on a \"recognized\" national exchange; (c) whose prices are not quoted on the NASDAQ automated quotation system (NASDAQ - where listed stocks must still meet requirement (a) above); or (d) in issuers with net tangible assets of less than $2,000,000 (if the issuer has been in continuous operation for at least three years) or $5,000,000 (if in continuous operation for less than three years), or with average revenues of less than $6,000,000 for the last three years. Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act and Regulation 240.15g(c)2 of the SEC require broker dealers dealing in penny stocks to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks and to obtain a manually signed and dated written receipt of the document before effecting any transaction in a penny stock for the investor's account. Potential investors in our common stock are urged to obtain and read such disclosure carefully before purchasing any common stock that are deemed to be \"penny stock.\" Moreover, Regulation 240.15g-9 of the SEC requires broker dealers in penny stocks to approve the account of any investor for transactions in such stocks before selling any penny stock to that investor. Compliance with this procedure may make it more difficult for investors in our common stock to resell their shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them. Holders should be aware that, according to SEC Release No. 34-29093, dated April 17, 1991, the market for penny stocks suffers from patterns of fraud and abuse.\nWe will incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company in the United States.\nAs a public company in the United States, we will incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses, including costs associated with U.S. public company reporting requirements. We will also incur costs associated with listing requirements, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules implemented by the SEC. The expenses incurred by U.S. public companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. We expect these rules and regulations would increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly, although we are currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. In estimating these costs, we took into account expenses related to insurance, legal, accounting, and compliance activities, as well as other expenses not currently incurred. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as our executive officers. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.\nOur directors have limited liability under Delaware law.\nPursuant to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and Delaware law, our directors are not liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty, except for: liability in connection with a breach of the duty of loyalty; acts or omissions not in good faith; acts or omissions that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; dividend payments or stock repurchases that are illegal under Delaware law; or any transaction in which a director has derived an improper personal benefit. Accordingly, except in those circumstances, our directors will not be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of their duty.\nOur two principal stockholders currently control all voting matters brought before our board of directors and shareholders.\nOur board of directors, which currently consists solely of the two directors appointed by the holders of the Company's Class A common stock voting as a separate class and a third director, approves the Company's annual budget, compensation matters, and major agreements. Currently, the two largest shareholders of the Company, Boulderado and Magnolia, collectively own all of our Class A common stock and a majority of our common stock, and will continue to own all of the outstanding Class A common stock and a majority of the outstanding common stock following the completion of the 2016 Financing. Further, each share of Class A common stock is entitled to cast 10 votes for all matters on which our stockholders vote, while each share of common stock is entitled to cast only one vote. Including the shares issued in the 2016 Financing to date, and assuming all currently exercisable warrants are exercised, Magnolia and Boulderado collectively own approximately 91.91% of our current outstanding shares of common stock and Class A Common Stock on a combined basis. As each share of Class A common stock has 10 votes for each share of common stock, Magnolia and Boulderado combined control the voting of 97.26% of all votes held by the holders of Class A common stock and common stock on a combined basis. Therefore, for the foreseeable future, the two majority shareholders will continue to control virtually all matters submitted to shareholders for a vote; may elect all of our directors; and, as a result, may control our management, policies, and operations. Our other shareholders will not have voting control over the company's actions, including the determination of other industries and markets that we may elect to enter.\nOur currently outstanding Class A common stock allows the holders of Class A common stock to elect two Directors who can each veto many important actions requiring approval of our board of directors.\nThe holders of our Class A common stock are also allowed to elect two Class A Directors to our Board of Directors. Under the terms of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, certain significant matters requiring approval by the Board of Directors also require the unanimous approval of our Class A Directors. Each of Boulderado and Magnolia agreed as part of the Voting and First Refusal Agreement, entered into on June 19, 2015, to elect as the Class A Directors each of Alex B. Rozek, as a nominee of Boulderado and Adam Peterson, as a nominee of Magnolia. In the event of (a) the death of a Class A Director, (b) the incapacitation of a Class A Director as a result of illness or accident, which makes it reasonably unlikely that the Class A Director will be able to perform his normal duties for the Company for a period of ninety (90) days, or (c) a change of control of Boulderado or Magnolia, then the Class A stockholder which nominated such dead or incapacitated Class A Director, or the Class A stockholder undergoing such change of control, shall convert all of such Class A common stock into shares of our Common Stock, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The Voting and First Refusal Agreement also provides each of the Company and the other party to the Voting Agreement with the right of first refusal to purchase the Class A common stock proposed to be sold by the other holder of Class A common stock.\nAt any time when shares of Class A common stock are outstanding, we may not, without the affirmative vote of all of the Class A Directors:\n* Amend, alter or otherwise change the rights, preferences or privileges of the Class A common stock, or amend, alter or repeal any provision of our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws in a manner that adversely affects the powers, preferences or rights of the Class A common stock.\n* Liquidate, dissolve or wind-up our business, effect any merger or consolidation or any other deemed liquidation event or consent to any of the foregoing.\n* Create, or authorize the creation of, or issue or issue additional shares of Class A common stock, or increase the authorized number of shares of any additional class or series of capital stock.\n* Increase or decrease the authorized number of directors constituting the Board of Directors.\n* Hire, terminate, change the compensation of, or amend the employment agreements of, our executive officers.\n* Purchase or redeem (or permit any subsidiary to purchase or redeem) or pay or declare any dividend or make any distribution on, any shares of our capital stock.\n* Create, or authorize the creation of, or issue, or authorize the issuance of any debt security, if our aggregate indebtedness for borrowed money following such action would exceed $10,000, or guarantee, any indebtedness except for our own trade accounts arising in the ordinary course of business.\n* Make, or permit any subsidiary to make, any loan or advance outside of the ordinary course of business to any employee or director.\n* Create, or hold capital stock in, any subsidiary that is not wholly owned (either directly or through one or more other subsidiaries) by us or permit any direct or indirect subsidiary to sell, lease, otherwise dispose all or substantially all of the assets of any subsidiary.\n* Change our principal business, enter new lines of business, or exit the current line of business.\n* Enter into any agreement involving the payment, contribution, or assignment by us or to us of money or assets greater than $10,000.\n* Enter into or be a party to any transaction outside of the ordinary course of business with any our directors, officers, or employees or any \"associate\" (as defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of any such person or entity.\n* Acquire, by merger, stock purchase, asset purchase or otherwise, any material assets or securities of any other corporation, partnership or other entity.\nOur board of directors is not composed of a majority of independent directors which poses a significant risk for us from a corporate governance perspective.\nOur two co-chief executive officers serve as two of our three directors. Our third director is the principal of a real estate brokerage and management company, in which we currently have a 30% ownership interest and a separate real estate entity in which we own a 15% equity interest. Our directors and executive officers are required to make interested party decisions, such as the approval of related party transactions, their level of compensation, and oversight of our accounting function. Our two largest shareholders also exercise control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the nomination of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions. We have chosen not to implement various corporate governance measures at this time, the absence of which may cause stockholders to have more limited protections against transactions implemented by our board of directors, conflicts of interest and similar matters. Stockholders should bear in mind our current lack of corporate governance measures in formulating their investment decisions.\nDelaware law and certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may prevent efforts by our stockholders to change the direction or management of the Company.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of the Company more difficult, including, but not limited to, the following:\n* setting forth specific procedures regarding how our stockholders may nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;\n* permitting our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval; and\n* limiting the rights of stockholders to amend our bylaws.\nThese provisions could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team.\nBecause we currently have no plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nWe currently do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain any additional future earnings to finance our operations and growth. Any future determination to pay cash dividends or other distributions on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent on our earnings, financial condition, operation results, capital requirements, and contractual, regulatory and other restrictions, including restrictions contained in any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries may incur, on the payment of dividends by us or by our subsidiaries to us, and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nYou could lose your entire investment.\nAlthough we had approximately $29,296,891 of cash funds in reserve as of February 29, 2016, we may need to raise significant additional capital in the future, including funds in excess of the 2016 Financing. If we do not raise a sufficient amount of funds to implement and continue our business plan, we may not be able to continue as a viable entity and you may lose your entire investment.\nOur authorized preferred stock exposes holders of our common stock to certain risks.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.001 per share. The authorized but un-issued preferred stock constitutes what is commonly referred to as \"blank check\" preferred stock. This type of preferred stock may be issued by the Board of Directors from time to time on any number of occasions, without shareholder approval, as one or more separate series of shares comprised of any number of the authorized but un-issued shares of preferred stock, designated by resolution of the Board of Directors stating the name and number of shares of each series and setting forth separately for such series the relative rights, privileges and preferences thereof, including, if any, the: (i) rate of dividends payable thereon; (ii) price, terms and conditions of redemption; (iii) voluntary and involuntary liquidation preferences; (iv) provisions of a sinking fund for redemption or repurchase; (v) terms of conversion to common stock, including conversion price, and (vi) voting rights. Such preferred stock may provide our Board of Directors the ability to hinder or discourage any attempt to gain control of us by a merger, tender offer at a control premium price, proxy contest or otherwise. Consequently, the preferred stock could entrench our management. The market price of our common stock could be depressed to some extent by the existence of the preferred stock. As of the date of this Annual Report, no shares of preferred stock have been issued.", "PERMNO": 16779, "SIC": 7310, "TIC": "BOMN"}
