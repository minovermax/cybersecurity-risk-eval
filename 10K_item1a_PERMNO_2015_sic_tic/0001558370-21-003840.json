accurately bill for testing services, or to comply with applicable laws relating to government healthcare programs, could adversely affect our business.\n\u25cf We depend on third parties to provide services critical to our XpresCheck diagnostic testing and vaccination business, and we would by adversely impacted by their failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or breaches of their information technology systems.\n\u25cf Our business operations may be materially impaired if we do not comply with privacy laws or information security policies, including laws protecting health information and personal data.\n\u25cf Hardware and software failures or delays in our information technology systems or payment systems could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of confidential information, customers and business opportunities.\n\u25cf Our capital expenditures in XpresCheck\u2122 Wellness Centers may not generate a positive return and we will incur significant additional costs.\n\u25cf We rely on international and domestic airplane travel, and the time that airline passengers spend in United States airports post-security.\n\u25cf We rely on a limited number of distributors and suppliers for certain of our products, and events outside our control may disrupt our supply chain and ultimately cause us to lose our concessions.\n\u25cf Our operating results may fluctuate significantly due to factors beyond our control.\n\u25cf Our expansion into new airports or off-airport locations may present increased risks due to our unfamiliarity with those areas.\n\u25cf We may not be able to execute our growth strategy to expand and integrate new concessions or future acquisitions into our business or remodel existing concessions.\n\u25cf If the estimates and assumptions we use to determine the size of our market are inaccurate, our future growth rate may be impacted.\n\u25cf Our business requires substantial capital expenditures and we may not have access to the capital required to maintain and grow our operations.\n\u25cf We currently rely on a skilled, licensed labor force to provide spa services, and the supply of this labor force is finite.\n\u25cf Unionization of our labor force or continued minimum wage increases could increase our cost of labor.\n\u25cf We compete for new locations in airports and may not be able to secure new locations.\n\u25cf We may not be able to predict accurately or fulfill customer preferences or demands.\n\u25cf Our leases may be terminated, either for convenience by the landlord or as a result of an XpresSpa default.\n\u25cf Our ability to operate depends on the traffic patterns of the terminals in which we operate.\n\u25cf We are dependent on our local partners.\n\u25cf Failure to comply with minimum airport concession disadvantaged business enterprise participation goals and requirements could lead to lost business opportunities or the loss of existing business.\n\u25cf If we are unable to protect our customers\u2019 credit card data and other personal information, we could be exposed to data loss, litigation and liability, and our reputation could be significantly harmed.\n\u25cf Negative social media regarding XpresSpa could result in decreased revenues and impact XpresSpa\u2019s ability to recruit workers.\n\u25cf We source, develop and sell products that may result in product liability defense costs and product liability payments.\n\u25cf We have commenced legal proceedings and/or licensing discussions with security, content distribution and/or telecommunications companies, which may be time consuming, may fail to lead to a license, or may result in litigation.\n\u25cf We may fail or be unable to protect our patents, trademarks or other proprietary rights we use.\n\u25cf We and our subsidiaries have been, are, and may become involved in litigation that could divert management\u2019s attention and harm our businesses.\n\u25cf Future acquisitions or business opportunities could involve unknown risks that could harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Business Operations\n\u25cf The market price of our Common Stock historically has been and likely will continue to be highly volatile, and our Common Stock has historically traded in low volumes.\n\u25cf Future sales of our shares of Common Stock or the exercise of a substantial number of warrants or options could cause the market price of our Common Stock to drop significantly, even if our business is otherwise performing well.\n\u25cf We have no current plans to pay dividends on our Common Stock, and our investors may not receive funds without selling their stock.\n\u25cf Our failure to meet the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a delisting of our Common Stock.\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020 and has rapidly spread throughout the United States and worldwide, and may continue to adversely affect our business operations, employee availability, financial condition, liquidity and cash flow for an extended period of time.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak is having an impact on the global economy, resulting in rapidly changing market and economic conditions. Similar to many businesses in the travel sector, our business has been materially adversely impacted by the recent COVID-19 outbreak due to the restrictions on travel that have been implemented. Effective March 24, 2020, we temporarily closed all global spa locations, largely due to the categorization of our spa locations by local jurisdictions as \u201cnon-essential services\u201d in connection with the outbreak of COVID-19. This has had a materially adverse impact on our cash flows from operations and caused a liquidity crisis. Ongoing significant reductions in business related activities could result in further loss of sales and profits and other material adverse effects. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial results, liquidity and cash flows will depend largely on future developments, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity and action taken to contain or prevent further spread within the U.S. and the related impact on consumer confidence and spending, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. As the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to spread rapidly in the U.S. and globally, related government and private sector responsive actions may continue to adversely affect our business operations. It is impossible to predict the effect and ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as the situation is rapidly evolving. If the COVID-19 outbreak continues and persists for an extended period of time, we expect there will be significant and material disruptions to our operations, which will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn connection with the preparation of our annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In connection with our audit of the year ended December 31, 2020, we identified a material weakness in our internal controls over our financial close and reporting process. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. Our management has concluded that additional formal procedures need to be put in place in the financial close and reporting process to ensure that appropriate reviews occur on all financial reporting analysis in a timely manner. We also concluded that we did not maintain a sufficient complement of corporate employee personnel with appropriate levels of accounting and controls knowledge and experience commensurate with our financial reporting requirements to appropriately analyze, record and disclose accounting matters completely and accurately. As this deficiency created a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement would not have been prevented or detected in a timely basis, management concluded that the control deficiency represented a material weakness and accordingly our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2020.\nWe are still considering the full extent of, and implementing, the procedures to implement in order to remediate the material weakness described above. Our preliminary remediation plan, complemented by our existing outsourced internal audit procedures, includes implementing a more robust review process, an increase in the supervision and monitoring of the financial reporting processes and our accounting personnel, and implementing better controls over calculations, analysis and conclusions associated with non-routine transactions at a more precise level. Moreover, we have hired a new chief financial officer and a new controller, each within the last six months of the date of this report, and such individuals will be criticial to the implementation of such procedures.\nWe cannot assure you that any of our remedial measures will be effective in resolving this material weakness. If our management is unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, or to certify the effectiveness of such controls, or if additional material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified in the future, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness and our stock price. In addition, if we do not maintain adequate, qualified financial and management personnel, processes and controls, we may not be able to manage our business effectively or accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our estimated aggregate total net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) were $150,926,000 for U.S. federal purposes, expiring 20 years from the respective tax years to which they relate, and $60,269,000 for U.S. federal purposes with an indefinite life due to new regulations in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Our ability to utilize our NOLs may be limited under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The limitations apply if an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, occurs. Generally, an ownership change occurs when certain stockholders increase their aggregate ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage in a testing period (typically three years). Additionally, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 imposed substantial restrictions on the utilization of NOL and tax credits in the event of an ownership change of a corporation. Thus, the Company\u2019s ability to utilize all such NOL and credit carryforwards may be limited. Future changes in stock ownership may also trigger an ownership change and, consequently, a Section 382 limitation.\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) was enacted on March 27, 2020 and includes favorable changes to tax law and incentives for businesses impacted by COVID-19. However, we do not anticipate the income tax law changes and incentives will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.\nGlobal economic and market conditions may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur business plan depends significantly on worldwide economic conditions and our success is dependent on consumer spending, which is sensitive to economic downturns, inflation and any associated rise in unemployment, decline in consumer confidence, adverse changes in exchange rates, increase in interest rates, increase in the price of oil, deflation, direct or indirect taxes or increase in consumer debt levels. As a result, economic downturns may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, uncertainty about global economic conditions poses a risk as businesses and individuals may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and declines in income or asset values. This could have a negative effect on corporate and individual spending on health and wellness and travel. These factors, taken together or individually, could cause material harm to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are not currently cash flow positive and will depend on funding to fund our ongoing business strategy. In the event that capital is unavailable, we will not be able to open new XpresCheck locations or fully develop our new travel health and wellness concept .\nThroughout its operating history, we have not generated sufficient cash from operations to fund our new store development. The design and implementation of our new travel health and wellness concept, as well as identification, management and implementation of opening additional XpresCheck Wellness Centers, will be capital intensive, , While we have mitigated the cash crisis we faced in the first half of 2020, we will be dependent upon managing and effectively deploying our cash resources and will likely require additional funding for our new location growth for XpresCheck Wellness Centers and the design and lauch of our new travel health and wellness concept until such time as we can produce enough cash to profitably fund our own location growth and ongoing development efforts..\nRisks Related to our Business Operations\nWe have limited operating history in the diagnostic testing and vaccination industry.\nDespite our management\u2019s extensive experience in health and wellness services, we have very limited specific operating history in the diagnostic testing and vaccination industry, including providing management services to a professional practice offering diagnostic testing or vaccination services. We face substantial risks and uncertainties to which our new diagnostic testing and vaccination line of business is subject. To address these risks and uncertainties, we must, among other things, successfully execute our business strategy, respond to competitive developments and attract and retain\nqualified personnel. We cannot assure you that we will operate profitably or that our business strategy will be successful. As a result, our diagnostic testing and vaccination line of business may not succeed.\nWe may never establish long-term formal contracts and relationships with professional practices for the ordering of and collection of samples for, or with laboratories for the performance of, COVID-19 and other medical testing and vaccination services in our XpresCheck\u2122 Wellness Centers.\nWe have begun offering COVID-19 and other medical testing services, as well as and certain seasonal vaccines in XpresCheck\u2122 Wellness Centers. On June 22, 2020, we began pilot testing and have established a formal contractual relationship with a professional practice for the ordering of and collection of samples for, and with clinical laboratories for the performance, of COVID-19 testing. These contractual relationships are for an initial period of one year, with automatic one year renewals, unless otherwise terminated by either party. We may never formalize longer-term arrangements with a professional practice or clinical laboratory for these purposes and may never conduct diagnostic testing and vaccination operations on a widescale basis. As a result, there can be no assurances that we will be able to execute our current plans or generate substantial revenue associated with our current XpresCheck COVID-19 testing and other medical testing and vaccines plans, including any COVID-19 vaccine that might become available in the future.\nWe may be unable to successfully secure new locations for, or transition our existing spa facilities into, XpresCheck\u2122 Wellness Centers at which COVID-19 or other medical testing and vaccinations will be ordered or performed.\nThere can be no assurances that we will be able to open new XpresCheck\u2122 Wellness Centers or further expand our initial sites, including JFK International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, Boston Logan International Airport, in order make available or renovate our other existing spa facilities for the purpose of operating a location at which XpresCheck COVID-19 testing will be ordered and/or performed by a professional practice. In addition, we have expanded our testing capabilities to include rapid testing services for other communicable diseases, including influenza, mononucleosis and group A streptococcus, as well as seasonal flu vaccination services which may require additional renovations and costs. If we are unable to successfully transition such facilities to locations at which COVID-19 testing or other medical testing and vaccination services will be ordered and/or performed due to issues with lease agreements, permits, licenses or other delays, we will not be able to move forward with our planned business transition.\nWe rely on a limited number of professional practices and suppliers and, in some cases, a single professional practice or supplier, for the COVID-19 test and certain of the laboratory substances, equipment and other materials used for COVID-19 tests, and any delays or difficulties securing these materials could disrupt our operations and materially harm our business.\nWe plan to contract with a limited number of professional practices, and potentially only a single professional practice, for the ordering of and collection of samples for COVID-19 testing. We currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for test kits, seasonal flu vaccines, collection supplies, reagents, and various other equipment and materials we intend to use in performing COVID-19 or other medical testing or for administering seasonal flu vaccines, and we may not be able to increase our number of suppliers significantly for these items. We currently do not have formal long-term agreements with any professional practice or supplier, and, as a result, our professional practice partners or suppliers could cease supplying these services or tests, materials and equipment to us at any time due to our inability to reach agreement on terms, disruptions in the professional practice\u2019s or supplier\u2019s operations, a determination to pursue other activities or lines of business, or for other reasons, or the professional practice or supplier could fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of services or materials that meet our specifications. Transitioning to a new professional practice or supplier or locating a temporary substitute, even if available, would be time-consuming and expensive, could result in interruptions in or otherwise affect the performance specifications of our intended operations, or could require that we revalidate the tests we use. In addition, the use of services, equipment or materials provided by a replacement professional practice or supplier could require us to alter our future operations and procedures. Moreover, we believe there are currently only a limited number of manufacturers that are capable of supplying and servicing some of the equipment and other materials necessary for our intended operations. As a result, replacement equipment and materials that meet our quality control and performance requirements may not be available on reasonable terms, in a timely manner or at all. If we encounter delays or difficulties securing, reconfiguring or revalidating the equipment, reagents and other materials required for administering tests, our operations could be materially disrupted and our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, and reputation could be adversely affected. We also may experience services or supply issues as we increase the volume or scope of our testing and vaccination services.\nThe COVID-19 testing technology we have chosen may not perform as expected, as a result of human error or otherwise, and may not aid in the testing of this virus.\nOn June 22, 2020, our professional practice partner began performing point of care COVID-19 testing at our JFK Airport XpresCheck location, and our testing service has since expanded to Newark Liberty International Airport and Boston Logan International Airport. Our success will depend on the COVID-19 and other communicable diseases testing technology we have chosen to use to provide a reliable, high-quality diagnostic result. Diagnostic testing for COVID-19 is relatively new, and there is no guarantee that the COVID-19 test technology we are currently using, or that we may choose to use in the future, will be accurate. We believe that customers will be particularly sensitive to COVID-19 test defects and errors. As a result, the failure of the chosen tests to perform as expected could significantly impair our reputation and the public image of the tests we use. There can be no assurance that the COVID-19 test technology will be broadly adopted for use. Many companies are developing tests for COVID-19 and the COVID-19 test technology we are currently using may not be effective. As a result, the failure or perceived failure of the chosen tests to perform as expected could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. If there is little or no demand for the COVID-19 test, our business could be materially harmed. Moreover, as testing technology evolves, develops and improves over time, we may not be able to identify and gain access to the latest and best COVID-19 testing methodologies and equipment.\nThere can be no assurance that demand for our COVID-19 testing services will exist in the future at the levels we expect or at all, because of the success of containment efforts, the emergence of a vaccine, widespread availability of testing at other locations or due to other events. If there is no demand for our COVID-19 testing services or demand is significantly lower than we expect, our business will be materially harmed.\nOur COVID-19 testing and other medical testing and vaccination capabilities may never achieve significant acceptance in the market or by countries or states that are imposing travel or quarantine restrictions.\nWe may expend substantial funds and management effort on the development and marketing of our professional practice partner\u2019s COVID-19 testing capabilities with no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our planned diagnostic testing business. Our ability to successfully offer COVID-19 tests will depend significantly on the perception that the tests used by our professional practice partner can reduce transmission risk and are reliable. Further, the success of our business may depend on being part of a national rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations. Moreover, we cannot assure you regarding the availability of, or our access to, various COVID-19 vaccinations. In addition, we are working with major airlines to support creation of potential air bridges between U.S. cities and international destinations, including, but not limited to, New York to London, and are engaged in discussions with multiple emerging Health Passport Apps. These apps would directly link into COVID-19 test results from there partnered labs, so that passengers would be able to show their test results through these apps to airlines and destinations in order to facilitate a hassle-free entry and avoid quarantines, where applicable. However, there can be no assurance as to the degree to which our public testing model assists passengers meet testing requirements for entry into, or avoidance of quarantine in various states and countries, and we may not be able to execute our COVID-19 testing strategy and our business results may be harmed.\nIn addition, we have expanded our testing capabilities to include rapid testing services for other communicable diseases, including influenza, mononucleosis and group A streptococcus, as well as seasonal flu vaccines. These plans will require us to expend additional funds and efforts to obtain medical testing supplies for these additional communicable diseases and to market our capabilities in these additional areas. Demand for these additional testing and vaccination services may never meet anticipated levels, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe use potentially hazardous materials, chemicals and patient samples in our XpresCheck diagnostic testing and vaccination business and any disputes relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly.\nOur professional practice partner\u2019s diagnostic testing activities involve the controlled use of hazardous laboratory materials and chemicals, including small quantities of acid and alcohol, and patient samples. They are subject to U.S. laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, the health and safety of employees and the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste. They could be liable for accidental contamination or discharge or any resultant injury from hazardous materials, and conveyance, processing, and storage of and data on patient samples. If they fail to comply with applicable laws or regulations, they could be required to pay penalties or be held liable for any damages that result and this liability could exceed their financial resources. Further, future changes to environmental health and safety laws could cause them to incur additional expense or restrict operations.\nIn the event of a lawsuit or investigation concerning such hazardous materials, we could be held responsible for any injury caused to persons or property by exposure to, or release of, these hazardous materials or patient samples that may contain infectious materials. The cost of this liability could exceed our resources. While we expect to maintain broad form liability insurance coverage for these risks, and we expect our professional practice partner to maintain appropriate malpractice insurance, the level or breadth of our or their coverage may not be adequate to fully cover potential liability claims to which we might be exposed.\nOur XpresCheck diagnostic testing and vaccination business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future changes in, or interpretations of, the law or regulations of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1967, and the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), or those of Medicare, Medicaid or other national, state or local agencies in the U.S. and other countries where we operate laboratories.\nThe performance of laboratory testing is subject to extensive U.S. regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. CLIA extends federal oversight to virtually all physician practices performing clinical laboratory testing and to clinical laboratories operating in the U.S. by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or, in the case of clinical laboratories, by a federally approved accreditation agency. The sanction for failure to comply with CLIA requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory\u2019s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. In addition, we expect to be subject to regulation under state law. State laws may require that laboratories and/or laboratory personnel meet certain licensing or other qualifications, specify certain quality controls or require maintenance of certain records. Applicable statutes and regulations could be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect our business. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on us, which may be costly.\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation of diagnostic products could result in increased costs and the imposition of fines or penalties, and could have a material adverse effect upon our business.\nThe FDA has regulatory responsibility for instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories. The FDA enforces laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, performance, labeling, advertising, marketing, distribution and surveillance of diagnostic products, and it regularly inspects and reviews the manufacturing processes and product performance of diagnostic products.\nFDA regulation of the diagnostic products we use could result in increased costs and administrative and legal actions for noncompliance, including warning letters, fines, penalties, product suspensions, product recalls, injunctions and other civil and criminal sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nIf we fail to comply with the complex federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that apply to our XpresCheck business, we could suffer severe consequences that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe expect our planned operations to be subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, all of which are subject to change. These laws and regulations currently include, among other things:\n\u25cf\nCLIA, which requires that laboratories obtain certification from the federal government, and state licensure laws;\n\u25cf\nFDA laws and regulations;\n\u25cf\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which imposes comprehensive federal standards with respect to the privacy and security of protected health information and requirements for the use of certain standardized electronic transactions, and amendments to HIPAA under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), which strengthen and expand HIPAA privacy and security compliance requirements, increase penalties for violators, extend enforcement authority to state attorneys general and impose requirements for breach notification;\n\u25cf\nstate laws regulating genetic testing and protecting the privacy of genetic test results, as well as state laws protecting the privacy and security of health information and personal data and mandating reporting of breaches to affected individuals and state regulators;\n\u25cf\nthe federal anti-kickback law, or the Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for, or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal healthcare program;\n\u25cf\nother federal and state fraud and abuse laws, such as anti-kickback laws, prohibitions on self-referral, and false claims acts, which may extend to services reimbursable by any third-party payor, including private insurers;\n\u25cf\nthe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires medical device manufactures to track and report to the federal government certain payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;\n\u25cf\nSection 216 of the federal Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, which requires applicable laboratories to report private payor data in a timely and accurate manner beginning in 2017 and every three years thereafter (and in some cases annually);\n\u25cf\nstate laws that impose reporting and other compliance-related requirements;\n\u25cf\nstate billing laws, including regulations on \u201cpass through billing\u201d which may limit our ability to submit claims for payment and/or mark up the cost of services in excess of the price paid for such services, and \u201cdirect-bill\u201d laws which may limit our ability to purchase services from a laboratory and bill for the services ordered;\n\u25cf\nsimilar foreign laws and regulations that apply to us in the countries in which we operate.\nThese laws and regulations are complex and are subject to interpretation by the courts and by government agencies. Our failure to comply could lead to civil or criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in state and federal healthcare programs, or prohibitions or restrictions on our laboratory\u2019s ability to provide or receive payment for our services. We believe that we are in material compliance with all statutory and regulatory requirements, but there is a risk that one or more government agencies could take a contrary position, or that a private party could file suit under the qui tam provisions of the federal False Claims Act or a similar state law. Such occurrences, regardless of their outcome, could damage our reputation and adversely affect important business relationships with third parties, including managed care organizations, and other private third-party payors.\nChanges in the way that the FDA regulates COVID-19 tests could result in the delay or additional expense in XpresCheck offering tests.\nHistorically, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) has exercised enforcement discretion with respect to most laboratory-developed tests (\u201cLDTs\u201d) and has not required laboratories that furnish LDTs to comply with the agency\u2019s requirements for medical devices (e.g., establishment registration, device listing, quality systems regulations, premarket clearance or premarket approval, and post-market controls). In recent years, however, the FDA publicly announced its intention to regulate certain LDTs and issued two draft guidance documents that set forth a proposed phased-in risk-based regulatory framework that would apply varying levels of FDA oversight to LDTs. However, these guidance documents were withdrawn at the end of the Obama administration and replaced by an informal discussion paper reflecting some of the feedback that FDA had received on LDT regulation. The FDA acknowledged that the discussion paper in January 2017 does not represent the formal position of the FDA and is not enforceable. Nevertheless, the FDA wanted to share its synthesis of the feedback that it had received in the hope that it might advance public discussion on future LDT oversight. Notwithstanding the discussion paper, the FDA continues to exercise enforcement discretion and may decide to regulate certain LDTs on a case-by-case basis at any time, which could result in delay or additional expense in offering tests. Until the FDA finalizes its regulatory position regarding LDTs, or other legislation is passed reforming the federal government\u2019s regulation of LDTs, it is unknown how the FDA may regulate tests we use in the future and what testing and data may be required to support any required clearance or approval.\nOur professional practice partner\u2019s failure to accurately bill for testing services, or to comply with applicable laws relating to government healthcare programs, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBilling for diagnostic testing and vaccination services is complex and subject to extensive and non-uniform rules and administrative requirements. Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, we expect to bill various payers, such as patients, insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid, clinicians, hospitals and employer groups if we begin performing point of care COVID-19 or other medical testing at our XpresCheck\u2122 Wellness Centers. We expect that the majority of our billing and related operations will be provided by a third party. Failure to accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing government healthcare programs may result in various consequences, including the return of overpayments, civil and criminal fines and penalties, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur additional liabilities from third-party claims, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Certain violations of these laws may also provide the basis for a civil remedy under the federal False Claims Act, including fines and damages of up to three times the amount claimed. The qui tam provisions of the federal False Claims Act and similar provisions in certain state false claims acts allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of the government.\nAlthough we expect to be in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion. The federal and state governments have substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages and fines far exceeds the rates at which services will be reimbursed, and the government has the remedy of excluding a non-compliant provider from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. We expect that federal and state governments continue aggressive enforcement efforts against perceived healthcare fraud. Legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel with substantial funding, powers, penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse.\nWe depend on third parties to provide services critical to our XpresCheck diagnostic testing and vaccination business, and we depend on them to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, any breaches of the information technology systems of third parties could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe depend on third parties to provide services critical to our XpresCheck diagnostic testing and vaccination business, including supplies, ground and air transport of clinical and diagnostic testing supplies and specimens, vaccinations, research products, and people, among other services. Third parties that provide services to us are subject to similar risks related to security of customer-related information and compliance with U.S., state, local, or international environmental, health and safety, and privacy and security laws and regulations as we will be. Any failure by third parties to comply with applicable laws, or any failure of third parties to provide services more generally, could have a material impact on us, whether because of the loss of the ability to receive services from the third parties, our legal liability for the actions or inactions of third parties, or otherwise. In addition, third parties to whom we outsource certain services or functions may process personal data, or other confidential information belonging to us. A breach or attack affecting these third parties could also harm our business, results of operations and reputation.\nOur business operations and reputation may be materially impaired if we do not comply with privacy laws or information security policies.\nWe will collect, generate, process or maintain sensitive information, such as patient data and other personal information. If we do not use or adequately safeguard that information in compliance with applicable requirements under federal, state and international laws, or if it were disclosed to persons or entities that should not have access to it, our business could be materially impaired, our reputation could suffer and we could be subject to fines, penalties and litigation. In the event of a data security breach, we may be subject to notification obligations, litigation and governmental investigation or sanctions, and may suffer reputational damage, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe will be subject to laws and regulations regarding protecting the security and privacy of certain healthcare and personal information, including: (a) the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the regulations thereunder, which establish (i) a complex regulatory framework including requirements for safeguarding protected health information and (ii) comprehensive federal standards regarding the uses and disclosures of protected health information; and (b) state laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act.\nHardware and software failures or delays in our information technology systems, including failures resulting from our systems conversions or otherwise, could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of confidential information, customers and business opportunities or otherwise adversely impact our business.\nIT systems will be used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business, including clinical testing, test reporting, billing, customer service, logistics and management of medical data. Our success depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our IT systems. A failure or delay in our IT systems could impede our ability to serve our customers and patients and protect their confidential personal data. Despite redundancy and backup measures and precautions that we have implemented, our IT systems may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions and shutdown from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, system conversion or standardization initiatives, human acts and natural disasters. These issues can also arise as a result from failures by third parties with whom we do business and for which we have limited control. Any disruption or failure of our IT systems could have a material impact on our ability to serve our customers and patients, including negatively affecting our reputation in the marketplace.\nWe must comply with complex and overlapping laws protecting the privacy and security of health information and personal data.\nThere are a number of state, federal and international laws protecting the privacy and security of health information and personal data. Under the administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has issued regulations which establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the privacy and security of personal health information (PHI) used or disclosed by healthcare providers and other covered entities.\nThe privacy regulations regulate the use and disclosure of PHI by healthcare providers engaging in certain electronic transactions or \u201cstandard transactions.\u201d They also set forth certain rights that an individual has with respect to his or her PHI maintained by a covered healthcare provider, including the right to access or amend certain records containing PHI or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of PHI. The HIPAA security regulations establish administrative, physical, and technical standards for maintaining the integrity and availability of PHI in electronic form. These standards apply to covered healthcare providers and also to \u201cbusiness associates\u201d or third parties providing services involving the use or disclosure of PHI. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations establish a uniform federal \u201cfloor\u201d and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent or provide individuals with greater rights with respect to the privacy or security of, and access to, their records containing PHI. As a result, we may be required to comply with both HIPAA privacy regulations and varying state privacy and data security laws.\nMoreover, HITECH, among other things, established certain health information security breach notification requirements. In the event of a breach of unsecured PHI, a covered entity must notify each individual whose PHI is breached, federal regulators and in some cases, must publicize the breach in local or national media. Breaches affecting 500 individuals or more are publicized by federal regulators who publicly identify the breaching entity, the circumstances of the breach and the number of individuals affected.\nThese laws contain significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of PHI. Given the complexity of HIPAA and HITECH and their overlap with state privacy and security laws, and the fact that these laws are rapidly evolving and are subject to changing and potentially conflicting interpretation, our ability to comply with the HIPAA, HITECH and state privacy requirements is uncertain and the costs of compliance are significant. Adding to the complexity is that our planned operations are currently evolving and the requirements of these laws will apply differently depending on such things as whether or not we bill electronically for our services, or provide services involving the use or disclosure of PHI and incur compliance obligations as a business associate. The costs of complying with any changes to HIPAA, HITECH and state privacy restrictions may have a negative impact on our operations. Noncompliance could subject us to criminal penalties, civil sanctions and significant monetary penalties as well as reputational damage.\nWe also will be required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees as well as receive and transfer certain payment information, to accept payments from our customers, including credit card information. Most states have adopted laws requiring notification of affected individuals and state regulators in the event of a breach of personal information, which is a broader class of information than the health information protected by HIPAA. Many state laws impose significant data security requirements, such as encryption or mandatory contractual terms to ensure ongoing protection of personal information. Activities outside of the United States implicate local and national data protection standards, impose additional compliance requirements, and generate additional risks of enforcement for non-compliance. The collection and use of such information may be subject to contractual obligations as well. If the security and information systems that we or our outsourced third-party providers use to store or process such information are compromised or if we, or such third parties, otherwise fail to comply with these laws, regulations, and contractual obligations, we could face litigation and the imposition of penalties that could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe must comply with all applicable privacy and data security laws in order to operate our business and may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to ensure ongoing compliance, to protect against security breaches and hackers or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches. Breaches of health information and/or personal data may be extremely expensive to remediate, may prompt federal or state investigation, fines, civil and/or criminal sanctions and significant reputational damage.\nOur capital expenditures in XpresCheck\u2122 Wellness Centers may not generate a positive return and we will incur significant additional costs.\nOur capital expenditures may not generate a positive return. Significant capital expenditures will be required to construct new XpresCheck\u2122 Wellness Centers or renovate our existing spa facilities to accommodate our proposed new business model. No assurance can be given that our future capital expenditures will generate a positive return or that we will have adequate capital available to finance such construction or renovations. If we are unable to, or elect not to, pay for costs associated with such construction or renovations, the ability of our professional practice partner to order or perform COVID-19 or other medical testing could be limited, and our competitive position could be harmed.\nAdditionally, we expect to incur significant additional costs as we expand the ability of our professional practice partner to perform on-site COVID-19 and other medical testing in XpresCheck\u2122 Wellness Centers. The COVID-19 outbreak could disrupt our future supply chain, including by impacting our ability to secure COVID-19 or other testing supplies and to provide personal protective equipment for our employees in our testing locations. For similar reasons, the COVID-19 pandemic has also adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, third parties that will be critical to our business, including vendors, suppliers, and business partners. These developments, and others that are difficult or impossible to predict, could materially impact our business, financial results, cash flows, and financial position.\nWe rely on international and domestic airplane travel, and the time that airline passengers spend in United States airports post-security. Continued lower demand for airline travel, a decrease in the desire of customers to buy spa services and products, or decreased time spent in airports would negatively impact XpresSpa\u2019s operations.\nXpresSpa depends upon a large number of airplane travelers with the propensity for health and wellness, and in particular spa treatments and products, spending significant time post-security clearance check points.\nIf the number of airline travelers decreases, the time that these travelers spend post-security decreases, and/or if travelers ability or willingness to pay for XpresSpa\u2019s products and services diminishes, this could have an adverse effect on XpresSpa\u2019s growth, business activities, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations. Some reasons for these events could include:\n\u25cf the impact of a public health epidemic, including the novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d), which has interfered and may continue to interfere with our ability, or the ability of our employees, workers, contractors, suppliers and other business partners to perform our and their respective responsibilities and obligations relative to the conduct of our business. A public health epidemic, including COVID-19, poses the risk of disruptions from the temporary closure of third-party suppliers and manufacturers, restrictions on the shipment of our products, restrictions on our employees' and other service providers' ability to travel, the decreased willingness or ability of our customers to travel or to utilize our services and shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others;\n\u25cf the temporary closure of our spa locations, largely due to the categorization of such spa locations by local jurisdictions as \u201cnon-essential services\u201d in connection with the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19;\n\u25cf terrorist activities (including cyber-attacks) impacting either domestic or international travel through airports where XpresSpa operates, causing fear of flying, flight cancellations, or an economic downturn, or any other event of a similar nature, even if not directly affecting the airline industry, may lead to a significant reduction in the number of airline passengers;\n\u25cf a decrease in business spending that impacts business travel, such as a recession;\n\u25cf a decrease in consumer spending that impacts leisure travel, such as a recession or a stock market downturn or a change in consumer lending regulations impacting available credit for leisure travel;\n\u25cf an increase in airfare prices that impacts the willingness of air travelers to fly, such as an increase in oil prices or heightened taxation from federal or other aviation authorities;\n\u25cf severe weather, ash clouds, airport closures, natural disasters, strikes or accidents (airplane or otherwise), causing travelers to decrease the amount that they fly and any of these events, or any other event of a similar nature, even if not directly affecting the airline industry, may lead to a significant reduction in the number of airline passengers;\n\u25cf scientific studies that malign the use of spa services or the products used in spa services, such as the impact of certain chemicals and procedures on health and wellness; or\n\u25cf streamlined security screening checkpoints, which could decrease the wait time at checkpoints and therefore the time air travelers budget for spending time at the airport.\nFurther, any disruption to, or suspension of services provided by airlines and the travel industry as a result of financial difficulties, labor disputes, construction work, increased security, changes to regulations governing airlines, mergers and acquisitions in the airline industry and challenging economic conditions causing airlines to reduce flight schedules or increase the price of airline tickets could negatively affect the number of airline passengers.\nAdditionally, the threat of terrorism and governmental measures in response thereto, such as increased security measures, recent executive orders in the United States impacting entry into the United States and changing attitudes towards the environmental impacts of air travel may in each case reduce demand for air travel and, as a result, decrease airline passenger traffic at airports.\nThe effect that these factors would have on our business depends on their magnitude and duration, and a reduction in airline passenger numbers will result in a decrease in our sales and may have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success will depend in part on relationships with third parties. Any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur success is dependent on our ability to maintain and renew our existing business relationships and to establish new business relationships. There can be no assurance that our management will be able to maintain such business relationships or enter into or maintain new business contracts and other business relationships, on acceptable terms, if at all. The failure to maintain important business relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe rely on a limited number of distributors and suppliers for certain of our products, and events outside our control may disrupt our supply chain, which could result in an inability to perform our obligations under our concession agreements and ultimately cause us to lose our concessions.\nWe rely on a small number of suppliers for our products. As a result, these distributors may have increased bargaining power and we may be required to accept less favorable purchasing terms. In the event of a dispute with a supplier or distributor, the delivery of a significant amount of merchandise may be delayed or cancelled, or we may be forced to purchase merchandise from other suppliers on less favorable terms. Such events could cause turnover to fall or costs to increase, adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, we have publicized our sale of certain brands of products in our stores - our failure to sell these brands may adversely affect our business.\nFurther, damage or disruption to our supply chain due to any of the following could impair our ability to sell our products: adverse weather conditions or natural disaster, government action, fire, terrorism, cyber-attacks, the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities, pandemics, industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues, strikes and other labor disputes, customs or import restrictions or other reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and business partners. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly due to certain factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nXpresSpa\u2019s operating results may fluctuate from period to period significantly because of several factors, including:\n\u25cf the timing and size of new unit openings, particularly the launch of new terminals;\n\u25cf passenger traffic and seasonality of air travel;\n\u25cf changes in the price and availability of supplies;\n\u25cf macroeconomic conditions, nationally locally and internationally;\n\u25cf changes in consumer preferences and competitive conditions;\n\u25cf expansion to new markets and new locations; and\n\u25cf increases in infrastructure costs, including those costs associated with the build-out of new concession locations and renovating existing concession locations.\nXpresSpa\u2019s operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of the factors discussed above. Accordingly, results for any period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other period or for any year.\nOur expansion into new airports or off-airport locations, and to the online marketplace, may present increased risks due to its unfamiliarity with those areas.\nXpresSpa\u2019s growth strategy depends upon managing our XpresCheck Wellness Center growth, and transitioning to our travel health and wellness concept, which will expanding into markets (including an online presence) where have little or no meaningful operating experience. Those markets and locations may have demographic characteristics, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns that are different from those in the markets where our existing spa and testing operations are located. As a result, new airport terminal and/or off-airport operations may be less successful than existing concession locations in current airport terminals. XpresSpa may find it more difficult in new markets to hire, motivate and keep qualified employees who can project its vision, passion and culture. XpresSpa may also be unfamiliar with local laws, regulations and administrative procedures, including the procurement of spa services retail licenses, in new markets which could delay the build-out of new concession locations and prevent it from achieving its target revenues on a timely basis. Operations in new markets may also have lower average revenues or enplanements than in the markets where XpresSpa currently operates. Operations in new markets may also take longer to ramp up and reach expected sales and profit levels, and may never do so, thereby negatively affecting XpresSpa\u2019s results of operations.\nOur growth strategy is dependent in part on our ability to successfully identify and open new locations.\nImplementing this part of our strategy depends on our ability to successfully identify new locations. We will also need to assess and mitigate the risk of any new locations, to open the location on favorable terms and to successfully integrate their operations with ours. We may not be able to successfully identify opportunities that meet these criteria, or, if we do, we may not be able to successfully negotiate and open new locations on a timely basis. If we are unable to identify and open new locations in accordance with its operating plan, our revenue growth rate and financial performance may fall short of our expectations.\nOur profitability relating to our operations depends on the number of airline passengers in the terminals in which we have concessions. Changes by airport authorities or airlines that lower the number of airline passengers in any of these terminals could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe number of airline passengers that visit the terminals in which we have concessions is dependent in part on decisions made by airlines and airport authorities relating to flight arrivals and departures. A decrease in the number of flights and resulting decrease in airline passengers could result in fewer sales, which could lower our profitability and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Concession agreements generally provide for a minimum annual guaranteed payment (\u201cMAG\u201d) payable to the airport authority or landlord regardless of the amount of sales at the concession. Currently, the majority of our concession agreements provide for a MAG that is either a fixed dollar amount or an amount that is variable based upon the number of travelers using the airport or other location, retail space used, estimated sales, past results or other metrics. If there are fewer airline passengers than expected or if there is a decline in the sales per airline passenger at these facilities, we will nonetheless be required to pay the MAG or fixed rent and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nFurthermore, the exit of an airline from a market or the bankruptcy of an airline could reduce the number of airline passengers in a terminal or airport where we operate and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to execute our growth strategy to expand and integrate new concessions or future acquisitions into our business or remodel existing concessions. Any new concessions, future acquisitions or remodeling of existing concessions may divert management resources, result in unanticipated costs, or dilute the ownership of our stockholders.\nPart of our growth strategy is to expand and remodel our existing facilities and to seek new concessions through tenders, direct negotiations or other acquisition opportunities. In this regard, our future growth will depend upon a number of factors, such as our ability to identify any such opportunities, structure a competitive proposal and obtain required financing and consummate an offer. Our growth strategy will also depend on factors that may not be within our control, such as the timing of any concession or acquisition opportunity.\nWe must also strategically identify which airport terminals and concession agreements to target based on numerous factors, such as airline passenger numbers, airport size, the type, location and quality of available concession space, level of anticipated competition within the terminal, potential future growth within the airport and terminal, rental structure, financial return and regulatory requirements. We cannot provide assurance that this strategy will be successful.\nIn addition, we may encounter difficulties integrating expanded or new concessions or any acquisitions. Such expanded or new concessions or acquisitions may not achieve anticipated turnover and earnings growth or synergies and cost savings. Delays in the commencement of new projects and the refurbishment of concessions can also affect our business. In addition, we will expend resources to remodel our concessions and may not be able to recoup these investments. A failure to grow successfully may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn particular, new concessions and acquisitions, and in some cases future expansions and remodeling of existing concessions, could pose numerous risks to our operations, including that we may:\n\u25cf have difficulty integrating operations or personnel;\n\u25cf incur substantial unanticipated integration costs;\n\u25cf experience unexpected construction and development costs and project delays;\n\u25cf face difficulties associated with securing required governmental approvals, permits and licenses (including construction permits) in a timely manner and responding effectively to any changes in federal, state or local laws and regulations that adversely affect our costs or ability to open new concessions;\n\u25cf have challenges identifying and engaging local business partners to meet Airport Concession Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (\"ACDBE\") requirements in concession agreements;\n\u25cf not be able to obtain construction materials or labor at acceptable costs;\n\u25cf face engineering or environmental problems associated with our new and existing facilities;\n\u25cf experience significant diversion of management attention and financial resources from our existing operations in order to integrate expanded, new or acquired businesses, which could disrupt our ongoing business;\n\u25cf lose key employees, particularly with respect to acquired or new operations;\n\u25cf have difficulty retaining or developing acquired or new business customers;\n\u25cf impair our existing business relationships with suppliers or other third parties as a result of acquisitions;\n\u25cf fail to realize the potential cost savings or other financial benefits and/or the strategic benefits of acquisitions, new concessions or remodeling; and\n\u25cf incur liabilities from the acquired businesses and we may not be successful in seeking indemnification for such liabilities.\nIn connection with acquisitions or other similar investments, we could incur debt or amortization expenses related to intangible assets, suffer asset impairments, assume liabilities or issue stock that would dilute the percentage of ownership of our then-current stockholders. We may not be able to complete acquisitions or integrate the operations, products, technologies or personnel gained through any such acquisition, which may have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the estimates and assumptions we use to determine the size of our market are inaccurate, our future growth rate may be impacted.\nMarket opportunity estimates and growth forecasts are subject to uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. The estimates and forecasts in this Annual Report on Form 10-K relating to the size and expected reemergence of the travel retail market may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the market in which we compete meets our size estimates and rate of return to normalized travel activity, our business could fail to reemerge or grow at similar rates, if at all. The principal assumptions relating to our market opportunity include projected reemergence and growth in the travel retail market and our share of the market. If these assumptions prove inaccurate, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur business requires substantial capital expenditures and we may not have access to the capital required to maintain and grow our operations.\nMaintaining and expanding our operations in our existing and new locations, expanding our testing operations, and the development of a new branding concept in the travel health and wellness space are all capital intensive activities. Specifically, the construction, redesign and maintenance of our locations in airport terminals where we operate, technology costs, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations require substantial capital expenditures. Moreover, the creation of a digital platform in the travel health and wellness space will take substantial capital resources. In connection with all of the foregoing, we may require additional capital in the future to fund our operations and respond to potential strategic opportunities, such as investments, acquisitions and expansions.\nIn the past year, we have been able to obtain such additional capital through access to the equity markets, selling our common stock and warrants. We may not be able to obtain additional financing through equity capital when needed, on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, the terms of our financings may be dilutive to, or otherwise adversely affect, holders of our Common Stock. Moreover, our ability to raise additional equity capital will be constrained because we have relatively few authorized shares of Common Stock that are not issued and outstanding or reserved for future issuance, and we may need to increase our authorized shares or undertake a reverse stock split in the near future to maintain our flexibility in access the equity capital markets. If we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis, we may be required to curtail or terminate some or all of our business plans. Any such financing that we undertake will likely be dilutive to our current stockholders.\nWe must continue to invest capital to maintain or to improve the success of our concessions and to meet refurbishment requirements in our concessions. Decisions to expand into new terminals could also affect our capital needs. Our actual capital expenditures in any year will vary depending on, among other things, the extent to which we are successful in renewing existing concessions and winning additional concession agreements.\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain our operating performance, generate sufficient cash flow, or have access to sufficient financing to continue our operations and development activities at or above our present levels, and we may be required to defer all or a portion of our capital expenditures. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if we cannot make such capital expenditures.\nWe currently rely on a skilled, licensed labor force to provide spa services, and the supply of this labor force is finite. If we cannot hire adequate staff for our locations, we will not be able to operate.\nAs of March 15, 2021, XpresSpa had approximately 119 full-time and 33 part-time employees in its locations. Excluding some dedicated retail staff, the majority of these employees are licensed to perform spa services, and hold such licenses as masseuses, nail technicians, aestheticians, barbers and master barbers. The demand for these licensed technicians has been increasing as more consumers gravitate to health and wellness treatments such as spa services. XpresSpa competes not only with other airport-based spa companies but with spa companies outside of the airport for this skilled labor force. In addition, all staff hired by XpresSpa must pass the background checks and security clearances necessary to work in airport locations. If XpresSpa is unable to attract and retain qualified staff to work in its airport locations, its ability to operate will be impacted negatively.\nEffective March 24, 2020, we temporarily closed all global locations and furloughed the majority of our XpresSpa employees, largely due to the categorization of such spa locations by local jurisdictions as \u201cnon-essential services\u201d in connection with the outbreak of COVID-19. We will evaluate reinstating the furloughed employees when restrictions related to non-essential services are eliminated, but there can be no assurances that such employees will return to our locations in a timely manner or at all.\nOur business is subject to various laws and regulations, and changes in such laws and regulations, or failure to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, could adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations in the United States, Netherlands and United Arab Emirates that affect the operation of our concessions. The impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, or our inability to respond effectively to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and, therefore, have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nFailure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of governmental authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. In addition, certain laws may require us to expend significant funds to make modifications to our concessions in order to comply with applicable standards. Compliance with such laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.\nOur labor force could unionize, putting upward pressure on labor costs.\nCurrently, XpresSpa stores in two airports have a labor force which is unionized. Major players in labor organization, and in particular \u201cUnite Here!\u201d which represents approximately 45,000 employees in the airport concessions and airline catering industries, could target XpresSpa locations for its unionization efforts. In the event of the successful unionization of all of XpresSpa\u2019s labor force, XpresSpa would likely incur additional costs in the form of higher wages, more benefits such as vacation and sick leave, and potentially also higher health care insurance costs.\nWe compete for new locations in airports and may not be able to secure new locations.\nWe participate in the highly competitive and lucrative airport concessions industry, and as a result compete for retail leases with a variety of larger, better capitalized concessions companies as well as smaller, mid-tier and single unit operators. Frequently, an airport includes only one similar travel health and wellness concept per terminal within its retail offering and, in those instances, we compete primarily with these other concessionaires.\nWe may not be able to predict accurately or fulfill customer preferences or demands.\nWe derive a significant amount of our revenue from the sale of massage, cosmetic and luxury products which are subject to rapidly changing customer tastes. The availability of new products and changes in customer preferences has made it more difficult to predict sales demand for these types of products accurately. Our success depends in part on our ability to predict and respond to quickly changing consumer demands and preferences, and to translate market trends into appropriate merchandise offerings. Additionally, due to our limited sales space relative to other retailers, the proper selection of salable merchandise is an important factor in revenue generation. We cannot provide assurance that our merchandise selection will correspond to actual sales demand. If we are unable to predict or rapidly respond to sales demand or to changing styles or trends, or if we experience inventory shortfalls on popular merchandise, our revenue may be lower, which could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur leases may be terminated, either for convenience by the landlord or as a result of an XpresSpa default.\nXpresSpa has store locations and kiosks in a number of airports in which the landlord, with prior written notice to XpresSpa, can terminate XpresSpa\u2019s lease, including for convenience or as necessary for airport purposes or operations. If a landlord elects to terminate a lease at an airport, XpresSpa may have to shut down one or more store locations at that airport. In addition, we have received rent concessions from landlords on a majority of our airport location leases relating to our temporary closures in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, allowing for the relief of minimum guaranteed payments in exchange for percentage-of-revenue rent or providing relief from rent through payment deferrals. These deferrals may lapse or expire with respect to any particular spa location before we believe it makes economic sense to reopen that location, in which case the landlord may decide to terminate the lease for that location if we do not agree to reopen it.\nAdditionally, XpresSpa leases have numerous provisions governing the operation of XpresSpa\u2019s stores. Violation of one or more of these provisions, even unintentionally, may result in the landlord finding that XpresSpa is in default of the lease. Violation of lease provisions may result in fines and, in some cases, termination of a lease.\nOur ability to operate depends on the traffic patterns of the terminals in which we operate, and the cessation or disruption of air traveler traffic in these terminals would negatively impact XpresSpa\u2019s addressable market.\nXpresSpa depends on a high volume of air travelers in its terminals. It is possible that a terminal in which XpresSpa operates could become subject to a lower volume of air travelers, which would significantly impact traffic near and around XpresSpa locations and therefore its total addressable market. Lower volume in a terminal could be caused by:\n\u25cf terminal construction that results in the temporary or permanent closure of a unit, or adversely impacts the volume or pattern of traffic flows within an airport;\n\u25cf an airline utilizing an airport in which XpresSpa operates could abandon that airport or an individual terminal in favor of other airports or terminals, or because it is contracting operations; or\n\u25cf adverse weather conditions could cause damage to the terminal or airport in which XpresSpa operates, resulting in the temporary or permanent closure of a unit.\nWe are dependent on our local partners.\nOur local partners, including our ACDBE partners, maintain ownership interests in certain of our locations. Our participation in these operating entities differs from market to market. While the precise terms of each relationship vary, our local partners may have control over certain portions of the operations of these concessions. The stores are operated pursuant to the applicable joint venture agreement governing the relationship between us and our local partner. Generally, these agreements also provide that strategic decisions are to be made by a committee comprised of us and our local partner. These concessions involve risks that are different from the risks involved in operating a concession independently, and include the possibility that our local partners:\n\u25cf are in a position to take action contrary to our instructions, our requests, our policies, our objectives or applicable laws;\n\u25cf take actions that reduce our return on investment;\n\u25cf go bankrupt or are otherwise unable to meet their capital contribution obligations;\n\u25cf have economic or business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our business interests or goals; or\n\u25cf take actions that harm our reputation or restrict our ability to run our business.\nFailure to comply with minimum airport concession disadvantaged business enterprise participation goals and requirements could lead to lost business opportunities or the loss of existing business.\nPursuant to ACDBE participation requirements, XpresSpa is often required to meet, or use good faith efforts to meet, certain minimum ACDBE participation requirements when bidding on or submitting proposals for new concession contracts. If XpresSpa is unable to find and/or partner with an appropriate ACDBE, XpresSpa may lose opportunities to open new locations. In addition, a number of XpresSpa\u2019s existing leases contain minimum ACDBE participation requirements which require the ACDBE to own a significant portion of the business being operated under those leases. The level of ACDBE participation requirements may affect XpresSpa\u2019s profitability and/or its ability to meet financial forecasts.\nFurther, if XpresSpa fails to comply with the minimum ACDBE participation requirements, XpresSpa may be held responsible for a breach of contract, which could result in the termination of a lease and impairment of XpresSpa\u2019s ability to bid on or obtain future concession contracts. To the extent that XpresSpa leases are terminated and XpresSpa is required to shut down one or more store locations, there could be a material adverse impact to its business and results of operations.\nContinued minimum wage increases could negatively impact our cost of labor.\nXpresSpa compensates its licensed technicians via a formula that includes commissions. As a result, an increase in the minimum wage could increase XpresSpa\u2019s cost of labor and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInformation technology systems failure or disruption, or changes to information technology related to payment systems, could impact our day-to-day operations.\nOur information technology systems are used to record and process transactions at our point-of-sale interfaces and to manage our operations. These systems provide information regarding most aspects of our financial and operational performance, statistical data about our customers, our sales transactions and our inventory management. Fire, natural disasters, power-loss, telecommunications failure, break-ins, terrorist attacks (including cyber-attacks), computer viruses, electronic intrusion attempts from both external and internal sources and similar events or disruptions may damage or impact our information technology systems at any time. These events could cause system interruption, delays or loss of critical data and could disrupt our acceptance and fulfillment of customer orders, as well as disrupt our operations and management. For example, although our point-of-sales systems are programmed to operate and process customer orders independently from the availability of our central data systems and even of the network, if a problem were to disable electronic payment systems in our stores, credit card payments would need to be processed manually, which could result in fewer transactions. Significant disruption to systems could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also continually enhance or modify the technology used for our operations. We cannot be sure that any enhancements or other modifications we make to our operations will achieve the intended results or otherwise be of value to our customers. Future enhancements and modifications to our technology could consume considerable resources. We may be required to enhance our payment systems with new technology, which could require significant expenditures. If we are unable to maintain and enhance our technology to process transactions, we may experience a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to protect our customers\u2019 credit card data and other personal information, we could be exposed to data loss, litigation and liability, and our reputation could be significantly harmed.\nPrivacy protection is increasingly demanding, and the use of electronic payment methods and collection of other personal information, including order history, travel history and other preferences, exposes XpresSpa to increased risk of privacy and/or security breaches as well as other risks. The majority of XpresSpa\u2019s sales are by credit or debit cards. Additionally, XpresSpa collects and stores personal information from individuals, including its customers and employees.\nIn the future, XpresSpa may experience security breaches in which credit and debit card information or other personal information is stolen. Although XpresSpa uses secure private networks to transmit confidential information, third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of the customer information transmitted in connection with credit and debit card sales, and its security measures and those of technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access to this information. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and are often difficult to detect for long periods of time, which may cause a breach to go undetected for an extensive period of time. Advances in computer and software capabilities, new tools, and other developments may increase the risk of such a breach. Further, the systems currently used for transmission and approval of electronic payment transactions, and the technology utilized in electronic payments themselves, all of which can put electronic payment at risk, are determined and controlled by the payment card industry, not by XpresSpa. In addition, contractors, or third parties with whom XpresSpa does business or to whom XpresSpa outsources business operations may attempt to circumvent its security measures in order to misappropriate such information and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. If a person is able to circumvent XpresSpa\u2019s security measures or those of third parties, he or she could destroy or steal valuable information or disrupt XpresSpa\u2019s operations. XpresSpa may become subject to claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information, and XpresSpa may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings relating to these types of incidents. Any such claim or proceeding could cause XpresSpa to incur significant unplanned expenses, which could have an adverse effect on its business or results of operations. Further, adverse publicity resulting from these allegations could significantly harm its reputation and may have a material adverse effect on it. Although XpresSpa carries cyber liability insurance to protect against these risks, there can be no assurance that such insurance will provide adequate levels of coverage against all potential claims.\nNegative social media regarding XpresSpa could result in decreased revenues and impact XpresSpa\u2019s ability to recruit workers.\nXpresSpa\u2019s affinity among consumers is highly dependent on their positive feelings about the brand, its customer service and the range and quality of services and products that it offers. A negative customer experience that is posted to social media outlets and is distributed virally could tarnish XpresSpa\u2019s brand and its customers may opt to no longer engage with the brand.\nWe employ people in multiple different jurisdictions, and the employment laws of those jurisdictions are subject to change. In addition, our services are regulated through government-issued operating licenses. Noncompliance with applicable laws could result in employee lawsuits or legal action taken by government authorities.\nXpresSpa must comply with a variety of employment and business practices laws across the United States, Netherlands and United Arab Emirates. XpresSpa monitors the laws governing its activities, but in the event it does not become aware of a new regulation or fails to comply with a regulation, it could be subject to disciplinary action by governing bodies and potentially employee lawsuits.\nWe source, develop and sell products that may result in product liability defense costs and product liability payments.\nXpresSpa\u2019s products contain ingredients that are deemed to be safe by the United States Federal Drug Administration and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. However, there is no guarantee that these ingredients will not cause adverse health effects to some consumers given the wide range of ingredients and allergies amongst the general population. XpresSpa may face substantial product liability exposure for products it sells to the general public or that is uses in its services. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert management\u2019s attention, and adversely affect XpresSpa\u2019s reputation and the demand for its products and services. XpresSpa to date has not been named as a defendant in any product liability action.\nWe have commenced legal proceedings and/or licensing discussions with security, content distribution and/or telecommunications companies. We expect that licensing discussions may be time consuming and may either, absent any litigation we initiate, fail to lead to a license, or may result in litigations commenced by the potential licensee.\nTo license or otherwise monetize the patent assets that we own, we have commenced legal proceedings and/or attempted to commence licensing discussions with a number of companies, during the course of which we allege that such companies infringe one or more of our patents. The future viability of our licensing program is highly dependent on the outcome of these discussions, and there is a risk that we may be unable to achieve the results we desire from such negotiations and be forced either to accept minimal royalties or commence litigations against the alleged infringer. In addition, the recipients of our licensing overtures have substantially more resources than we do, which could make our licensing efforts more difficult. Furthermore, due to changes in the approach to patent laws around the world it has become much easier for potential licensees to commence proceedings to revoke or otherwise nullify our patents in lieu of engaging in bona fide licensing discussions. There is a real risk that any potential licensee we approach would rather commence proceedings to revoke our patents than engage in any licensing discussions whatsoever.\nWe anticipate that any legal proceedings could continue for several years. While we endeavor, where possible, to engage counsel on a full or partial contingency basis, proceedings may commence that fall outside of contingency arrangements with counsel and may require significant expenditures for legal fees and other expenses. Disputes regarding the assertion of patents and other intellectual property rights are highly complex and technical. Once initiated, we may be forced to litigate against other parties in addition to the originally named defendants. Our adversaries may allege defenses and/or file counterclaims for, among other things, revocation of our patents or file collateral litigations in an effort to avoid or limit liability and damages for patent infringement. If such actions by our adversaries are successful, they may preclude our ability to derive licensing revenue from the patents being asserted.\nThere is a risk that we may be unable to achieve the results we desire from such litigation, which may harm our business. In addition, the defendants in these litigations have substantially more resources than we do, which could make our litigation efforts more difficult.\nA court may find our patents invalid, not infringed or unenforceable and/or the USPTO or other relevant patent offices in various countries may either invalidate the patents or materially narrow the scope of their claims during the course of a reexamination, opposition or other such proceeding. In addition, even with a positive trial court verdict, the patents may be invalidated, found not infringed or rendered unenforceable on appeal. This risk may occur either presently or from time to time in connection with future litigations we may bring.\nPatent litigation is inherently risky, and the outcome is uncertain. Some of the parties that we believe infringe on our patents are large and well-financed by companies with substantially greater resources than ours. We believe that these parties may devote a substantial amount of resources in an attempt to avoid or limit a finding that they are liable for infringing on our patents or, in the event liability is found, to avoid or limit the amount of associated damages. In addition, there is a risk that these parties may file reexaminations or other proceedings with the USPTO or other government agencies in the United States or abroad in an attempt to invalidate, narrow the scope or render unenforceable the patents we own. In addition, as part of our ongoing legal proceedings, the validity and/or enforceability of our patents-in-suit is often challenged in a court or an administrative proceeding.\nWe and our subsidiaries have been, are, and may become involved in litigation that could divert management\u2019s attention and harm our businesses.\nLitigation often is expensive and diverts management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our businesses. We may be exposed to claims against us even if no wrongdoing has occurred. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming, costly to defend, disruptive to our management\u2019s attention and to our resources, damaging to our reputation and brand, and may cause us to incur significant expenses. Even if we are indemnified against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations.\nNew legislation, regulations or court rulings related to enforcing patents could harm our business and operating results.\nIntellectual property is the subject of intense scrutiny by the courts, legislatures and executive branches of governments around the world. Various patent offices, governments or intergovernmental bodies may implement new legislation, regulations or rulings that impact the patent enforcement process, or the rights of patent holders and such changes could negatively affect licensing efforts and/or litigations. For example, limitations on the ability to bring patent enforcement claims, limitations on potential liability for patent infringement, lower evidentiary standards for invalidating patents, increases in the cost to resolve patent disputes and other similar developments could negatively affect our ability to assert our patent or other intellectual property rights.\nIt is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed, or whether any of the proposals will become enacted as laws. Compliance with any new or existing laws or regulations could be difficult and expensive, affect the manner in which we conduct our business and negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure or inability to protect the trademarks or other proprietary rights we use or claims of infringement by us of rights of third parties, could adversely affect our competitive position or the value of our brands.\nWe believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position. However, any actions that we take to protect the intellectual property we use may not prevent unauthorized use or imitation by others, which could have an adverse impact on our image, brand or competitive position. If we commence litigation to protect our interests or enforce our rights, we could incur significant legal fees. We also cannot provide assurance that third parties will not claim infringement by us of their proprietary rights. Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time consuming and distracting for our management, result in costly litigation, cause changes to existing retail concepts or delays in introducing retail concepts, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. As a result, any such claim could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture acquisitions or business opportunities could involve unknown risks that could harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, acquire businesses or make investments, directly or indirectly through our subsidiaries, that involve unknown risks, some of which will be particular to the industry in which the investment or acquisition targets operate, including risks in industries with which we are not familiar or experienced. Although we intend to conduct appropriate business, financial and legal due diligence in connection with the evaluation of future investment or acquisition opportunities, there can be no assurance that our due diligence investigations will identify every matter that could have a material adverse effect on us. We may be unable to adequately address the financial, legal and operational risks raised by such investments or acquisitions, especially if we are unfamiliar with the relevant industry. The realization of any unknown risks could expose us to unanticipated costs and liabilities and prevent or limit us from realizing the projected benefits of the investments or acquisitions, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and trading price.\nRisks Related to our Capital Stock\nStock prices can be volatile, and this volatility may depress the price of our common stock.\nThe stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, which have affected the market price of many companies in ways that may have been unrelated to those companies\u2019 operating performance. Furthermore, we believe that our stock price may reflect certain future growth and profitability expectations. If we fail to meet these expectations, then our stock price may significantly decline, which could have an adverse impact on investor confidence. We believe that various factors may cause the market price of our Common Stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including, among others, the following:\n\u25cf the effects that COVID-19 might have on our results of operations and financial position;\n\u25cf additions to or departures of our key personnel;\n\u25cf announcements of innovations by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, capital commitments, or new technologies;\n\u25cf new regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning our patents and efforts in licensing and/or enforcing our patents;\n\u25cf lawsuits, claims, and investigations that may be filed against us, and other events that may adversely affect our reputation;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts; and\n\u25cf general and industry-specific economic conditions.\nFuture sales of our shares of Common Stock by our stockholders could cause the market price of our Common Stock to drop significantly, even if our business is otherwise performing well.\nAs of March 26, 2021, we have 105,282,382 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding, excluding shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of warrants, options or restricted stock units. As shares saleable under Rule 144 are sold or as restrictions on resale lapse, the market price of our Common Stock could drop significantly if the holders of shares of restricted stock sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. This decline in our stock price could occur even if our business is otherwise performing well.\nThe exercise of a substantial number of warrants or options by our security holders may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock.\nShould our warrants and options outstanding as of March 26, 2021 be exercised, there would be an additional 41,220,859 shares of Common Stock eligible for trading in the public market. The incentive equity instruments granted to our management, employees, directors and consultants are subject to acceleration of vesting of 75% and 100% (according to the agreement signed with each grantee) upon a subsequent change of control. Such securities, if exercised, will increase the number of issued and outstanding shares of our Common Stock. Therefore, the sale of the shares of Common Stock underlying the warrants and options could have an adverse effect on the market price for our securities and/or on our ability to obtain future financing.\nWe have no current plans to pay dividends on our Common Stock, and our investors may not receive funds without selling their stock.\nWe have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our Common Stock, nor do we expect to pay any cash dividends on our Common Stock for the foreseeable future. Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in our Common Stock for that purpose. We currently intend to retain any additional future earnings to finance our operations and growth and, therefore, we have no plans to pay cash dividends on our Common Stock at this time. Any future determination to pay cash dividends on our Common Stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be dependent on our earnings, financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, any contractual restrictions, and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant.\nAccordingly, our investors may have to sell some or all of their Common Stock in order to generate cash from their investment. You may not receive a gain on your investment when you sell our Common Stock and may lose the entire amount of your investment.\nThe market price of our Common Stock historically has been and likely will continue to be highly volatile.\nThe market price for our shares of Common Stock historically has been highly volatile, and the market for our shares has from time-to-time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, based both on our operating performance and for reasons that appear to be unrelated to our operating performance. The market price of our shares of Common Stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf the impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows;\n\u25cf the level of our financial resources;\n\u25cf our ability to develop and introduce new products and services;\n\u25cf developments concerning our intellectual property rights generally or those of us or our competitors;\n\u25cf our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and business plan and the effects that such financing may have on the value of the equity instruments held by our stockholders;\n\u25cf our ability to retain key personnel;\n\u25cf general economic conditions and level of consumer and corporate spending on health and wellness, and travel;\n\u25cf our ability to hire a skilled labor force and the costs associated;\n\u25cf our ability to secure new retail locations, maintain existing ones, and ensure continued customer traffic at those locations;\n\u25cf changes in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or deviations in our business and the trading price of our Common Stock from the estimates of securities analysts;\n\u25cf our ability to protect our customers\u2019 financial data and other personal information;\n\u25cf the loss of one or more of our significant suppliers;\n\u25cf unexpected trends in the health and wellness and travel industries and potential technology and service obsolescence;\n\u25cf market acceptance, quality, pricing, availability and useful life of our products and/or services, as well as the mix of our products and services sold; and\n\u25cf lawsuits, claims, and investigations that may be filed against us and other events that may adversely affect our reputation.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a delisting of our Common Stock.\nThe continued listing standards of Nasdaq provide, among other things, that a company may be delisted if the bid price of its stock drops below $1.00 for a period of 30 consecutive business days or if stockholders\u2019 equity is less than $2,500,000. On January 2, 2020, we received a deficiency letter from The Nasdaq Stock Market which indicated that we were not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. Although we were able to regain compliance by the applicable deadline, our stock price may fall below the minimum bid price in the future and we may be unable to regain compliance. Additionally, if we fail to comply with any other continued listing standards of Nasdaq, our Common Stock would also be subject to delisting. If that were to occur, our Common Stock would be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by these requirements could discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our Common Stock. This would significantly and negatively affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and would significantly and negatively affect the value and liquidity of our Common Stock. These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our Common Stock. Delisting of our Common Stock also would likely have a negative effect on the price of our Common Stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our Common Stock when you wish to do so. Further, if we were to be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market, our Common Stock would cease to be recognized as covered securities and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. If we seek to implement a reverse stock split in order to remain listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, the announcement and/or implementation of a reverse stock split could significantly negatively affect the price of our Common Stock.\nDelisting from Nasdaq could adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities, would significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and would negatively affect the value and liquidity of our Common Stock. Delisting could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities.\nOur Common Stock has historically traded in low volumes. We cannot predict whether an active trading market for our Common Stock will ever develop. Even if an active trading market develops, the market price of our Common Stock may be significantly volatile.\nHistorically, our Common Stock has experienced a lack of consistent trading liquidity. In the absence of an active trading market you may have difficulty buying and selling our Common Stock at all or at the price you consider reasonable; and market visibility for shares of our Common Stock may be limited, which may have a depressive effect on the market price for shares of our Common Stock and on our ability to raise capital or make acquisitions by issuing our Common Stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions of Delaware law, provisions in our charter and bylaws, and our stockholder rights plan could prevent or frustrate attempts by stockholders to change our Board of Directors or current management and could delay, discourage or make more difficult a third-party acquisition of control of us.\nWe are a Delaware corporation and, as such, certain provisions of Delaware law could prevent or frustrate attempts by stockholders to change the Board of Directors or current management, or could delay, discourage or make more difficult a third-party acquisition of control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to stockholders or the stockholders regard it as such. We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d), which prohibits certain \u201cbusiness combination\u201d transactions (as defined in Section 203) with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (defined in Section 203 as a 15% or greater stockholder) for a period of three years after a stockholder becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d unless the attaining of \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d status or the transaction is pre-approved by our Board of Directors, the transaction results in the attainment of at least an 85% ownership level by an acquirer or the transaction is later approved by our Board of Directors and by our stockholders by at least a 662/3 percent vote of our stockholders other than the \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d each as specifically provided in Section 203.\nOur certificate of incorporation and our bylaws, each as currently in effect, also contain certain provisions that may delay, discourage or make more difficult a third-party acquisition of control of us. Such provisions include a provision that any vacancies on our Board of Directors may only be filled by a majority of the directors then serving, although not a quorum, and not by the stockholders and the ability of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock, without stockholder approval, that could dilute the stock ownership of a potential unsolicited acquirer and hinder an acquisition of control of us that is not approved by our Board of Directors, including through the use of preferred stock in connection with a stockholder rights plan.\nWe have also adopted a stockholder rights plan in the form of a Section 382 Rights Plan, designed to help protect and preserve our substantial tax attributes primarily associated with our NOLs under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and research tax credits under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code and related United States Treasury regulations, which was approved by our stockholders in December 2016 and expires in March 2022. Although this is not the purpose of the Section 382 Rights Plan, it could have the effect of making it uneconomical for a third party to acquire us on a hostile basis.\nThese provisions of the DGCL, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and our Section 382 Rights Plan may delay, discourage or make more difficult certain types of transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the current market price, and might limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they think may be in their best interest.\nHaving availed ourselves of scaled disclosure available to smaller reporting companies, we cannot be certain if such reduced disclosure will make our Common Stock less attractive to investors.\nUnder Section 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d is a company that is not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company, and has a public float of less than $250 million and annual revenues of less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. Similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies are permitted to provide simplified executive compensation disclosure in their filings; they are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting; and they have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports. Decreased disclosure in our SEC filings as a result of our having availed ourselves of scaled disclosure may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects.\nOther Risk Factors\nOur confidential information may be disclosed by other parties.\nWe routinely enter into non-disclosure agreements with other parties, including but not limited to vendors, law firms, parties with whom we are engaged in negotiations, and employees. However, there exists a risk that those other parties will not honor their contractual obligations to not disclose our confidential information. This may include parties who breach such obligations in the context of confidential settlement offers and/or negotiations. In addition, there exists a risk that, upon such breach and subsequent dissemination of our confidential information, third parties and potential licensees may seek to use such confidential information to their advantage and/or to our disadvantage including in legal proceedings in which we are involved. Our ability to act against such third parties may be limited, as we may not be in privity of contract with such third parties.\nWe may fail to meet publicly announced financial guidance or other expectations about our business, which would cause our stock to decline in value.\nFrom time to time, we provide preliminary financial results or forward-looking financial guidance, to our investors. Such statements are based on our current views, expectations and assumptions that may not prove to be accurate and may vary from actual results and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, performance, achievements or share prices to be materially different from any future results, performance, achievements or share prices expressed or implied by such statements. Such risks and uncertainties include the risk factors contained herein. If we fail to meet our projections and/or other financial guidance for any reason, our stock price could decline.\nIf we raise additional capital in the future, stockholders\u2019 ownership in us could be diluted.\nAny issuance of equity we may undertake in the future to raise additional capital could cause the price of our shares to decline or require us to issue shares at a price that is lower than that paid by holders of our shares in the past, which would result in previously issued shares being dilutive. If we obtain funds through a credit facility or through the issuance of debt or preferred securities, these securities would likely have rights senior to rights as a holder of Common Stock, which could impair the value of our shares.", "PERMNO": 12017, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "XSPA"}
