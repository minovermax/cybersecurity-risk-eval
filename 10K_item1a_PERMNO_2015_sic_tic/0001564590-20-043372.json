{"cik": "878726", "company": "TUESDAY MORNING CORP/DE", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-09-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to significant risks, including the risks and uncertainties described below. These risks and uncertainties and the other information in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements, should be carefully considered. If any of the events described below actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected in a material way.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nAs a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, we are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy proceedings, and operating under Chapter 11 may restrict our ability to pursue strategic and operational initiatives.\nFor the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, our operations and our ability to execute our business strategy will be subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy. These risks include:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain timely Bankruptcy Court approval with respect to motions filed in the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022\nthe Bankruptcy Court\u2019s rulings in the Chapter 11 Cases and the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases generally;\n\u2022\nour ability to comply with the restrictions imposed by the terms of the DIP ABL Facility and the DIP Term Facility, including the Company\u2019s ability to maintain certain minimum liquidity requirements, complete the DIP Term Facility, and obtain approval of a plan of reorganization or sale of all of its assets by agreed upon deadlines;\n\u2022\nthe length of time that we will operate under Chapter 11 protection and the continued availability of operating capital during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022\nour ability to continue to operate our business during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022\nemployee attrition and our ability to retain senior management and other key personnel due to the distractions and uncertainties;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of the overall restructuring activities pursuant to the Chapter 11 Cases and any additional strategies we may employ to address our liquidity and capital resources;\n\u2022\nthe actions and decisions of creditors and other third parties that have an interest in the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with third parties seeking and obtaining authority to terminate or shorten the Company\u2019s exclusivity period to propose and confirm one or more plans of reorganization, for the appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee or to convert the Chapter 11 proceeding to a Chapter 7 proceeding;\n\u2022\nincreased legal and other professional costs necessary to execute the Company\u2019s restructuring;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain relationships with suppliers, customers, employees and other third parties as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022\nthe trading price and volatility of the Company\u2019s common stock and the effects of the delisting from Nasdaq; and\n\u2022\nlitigation and other risks inherent in a bankruptcy process.\nBecause of the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Cases, we cannot predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 process may have on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. We believe that our plans, already implemented and continuing to be implemented, will mitigate the conditions and events that have raised substantial doubt about the entity\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. However, due to the uncertainty around the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related disruption to our business and financial impacts, and because our plans, including those in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, are not yet finalized, fully executed, or approved by the Bankruptcy Court, they cannot be deemed probable of mitigating this substantial doubt.\nOur common stock has been delisted from trading on Nasdaq, and is traded only in the over-the-counter market, which could negatively affect our stock price and liquidity. Additionally, trading in our securities during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. Trading prices for the Company\u2019s common stock may bear little or no relationship to the actual recovery, if any, by holders of the Company\u2019s common stock in the Chapter 11 Cases.\nOn May 27, 2020, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) notifying it that, as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases and in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5101, 5110(b) and IM-5101-1, Nasdaq determined that the Company\u2019s common stock would be delisted from Nasdaq. On June 8, 2020, trading in the Company\u2019s common stock on Nasdaq was suspended. On July 1, 2020, Nasdaq filed a Form 25 with the SEC to delist the Company\u2019s common stock and the delisting was effective 10 days thereafter.\nOn June 8, 2020, the Company\u2019s common stock began trading on the OTC Pink marketplace under the symbol \u201cTUESQ\u201d. The Company can provide no assurance that the Company\u2019s common stock will continue to trade on this market, whether broker-dealers will continue to provide public quotes of the Company\u2019s common stock on this market, whether the trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock will be sufficient to provide for an efficient trading market or whether quotes for the Company\u2019s common stock will continue on this market in the future. The Company cautions that trading in the Company\u2019s common stock during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. Trading prices for the Company\u2019s common stock may bear little or no relationship to the actual recovery, if any, by holders of the Company\u2019s common stock in the Chapter 11 Cases.\nThe pursuit of the Chapter 11 Cases has consumed and will continue to consume a substantial portion of the time and attention of our management, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and we may face increased levels of employee attrition.\nWhile the Chapter 11 Cases continue, our management will be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort focusing on the cases. This diversion of attention may materially adversely affect the conduct of our business, and, as a result, our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the Chapter 11 Cases are protracted.\nDuring the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, our employees will face considerable distraction and uncertainty and we may experience increased levels of employee attrition. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to meet customer expectations, thereby adversely affecting our business and results of operations. The failure to retain or attract members of our management team and other key personnel could impair our ability to execute our strategy and implement operational initiatives, thereby having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are not able to confirm a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization or liquidation or are not able to consummate a sale of the Company or certain of its material assets pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, we could be required to liquidate under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nThe Company intends to pursue, among other things, a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization or the consummation of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all assets of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code. If we are not able to confirm a plan of reorganization or liquidation or consummate a Section 363 sale, we could be forced to liquidate under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nUpon a showing of cause, the Bankruptcy Court may convert the Chapter 11 Cases to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In such event, a Chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate our assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code. We believe that liquidation under Chapter 7 would result in significantly smaller distributions being made to our creditors than those provided for in a Chapter 11 sale because of (i) the likelihood that the assets would have to be sold or otherwise disposed of in a distressed fashion over a short period of time rather than in a controlled manner and as a going concern, (ii) additional administrative expenses involved in the appointment of a Chapter 7 trustee, and (iii) additional expenses and claims, some of which would be entitled to priority, that would be generated during the liquidation and from the rejection of leases and other executory contracts in connection with a cessation of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that our current cash position and amounts of cash from future operations will be sufficient to fund operations. In the event that we do not have sufficient cash to meet our liquidity requirements, and our current financing is insufficient or exit financing is not available, we may be required to seek additional financing. There can be no assurance that such additional financing would be available, or, if available, would be available on acceptable terms. Failure to secure any necessary exit financing or additional financing would have a material adverse effect on our operations and ability to continue as a going concern.\nIf we pursue a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, our post-bankruptcy capital structure is yet to be determined, and any changes to our capital structure may have a material adverse effect on existing debt and security holders.\nIf we pursue a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, our post-bankruptcy capital structure will be set pursuant to a plan that requires Bankruptcy Court approval. Any reorganization of our capital structure may include exchanges of new debt or equity securities for our existing securities, and such new debt or equity securities may be issued at different interest rates, payment schedules and maturities than our existing creditors. The success of a reorganization through any such exchanges or modifications will depend on approval by the Bankruptcy Court and the willingness of existing security holders to agree to the exchange or modification, and there can be no guarantee of success. If such exchanges or modifications are successful, holders of our debt may find their holdings no longer have any value or are materially reduced in value, or they may be converted to equity and be diluted or may be modified or replaced by debt with a principal amount that is less than the outstanding principal amount, longer maturities and reduced interest rates. There can be no assurance that any new debt or equity securities will maintain their value at the time of issuance. If existing debt or equity holders are adversely affected by a reorganization, it may adversely affect our ability to issue new debt or equity in the future.\nAny plan of reorganization that we may implement will be based in large part upon assumptions and analyses developed by us. If these assumptions and analyses prove to be incorrect, our plan may be unsuccessful in its execution.\nAny plan of reorganization that we may implement could affect both our capital structure and the ownership, structure and operation of our businesses and will reflect assumptions and analyses based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that we consider appropriate under the circumstances. Whether actual future results and developments will be consistent with our expectations and assumptions depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to (i) our ability to change substantially our capital structure; (ii) our ability to obtain adequate liquidity and financing sources; (iii) our ability to maintain customers\u2019 confidence in our viability as a continuing entity and to attract and retain sufficient business from them; (iv) our ability to obtain merchandise; (v) our ability to retain key employees, and (vi) the overall strength and stability of general economic conditions. The failure of any of these factors could materially adversely affect the successful reorganization of our businesses.\nIn addition, any plan of reorganization will rely upon financial projections, including with respect to revenues, EBITDA, capital expenditures, debt service and cash flow. Financial forecasts are necessarily speculative, and it is likely that one or more of the assumptions and estimates that are the basis of these financial forecasts will not be accurate. In our case, the forecasts will be even more speculative than normal, because they may involve fundamental changes in the nature of our capital structure. Accordingly, we expect that our actual financial condition and results of operations will differ, perhaps materially, from what we have anticipated. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the results or developments contemplated by any plan of reorganization we may implement will occur or, even if they do occur, that they will have the anticipated effects on us and our subsidiaries or our businesses or operations. The failure of any such results or developments to materialize as anticipated could materially adversely affect the successful execution of any plan of reorganization.\nWe may be unable to comply with restrictions imposed by our DIP ABL Facility and DIP Term Facility.\nThe DIP ABL Facility and the DIP Term Facility contain customary affirmative and negative covenants for debtor-in-possession financings, which include, among other things, restrictions on (i) indebtedness, (ii) liens, (iii) mergers, consolidations and dispositions, (iv) affiliate transactions, (v) changes in the nature of our businesses, (vi) dividends, distributions, and other restricted payments, (vii) the use of loan proceeds and cash on hand, (viii) entering into agreements that restrict our subsidiaries from paying dividends or distributions or that restrict us or our subsidiaries from granting security interests and other liens, (ix) advances, loans and investments, and (x) transactions with respect to our subsidiaries. In addition, the DIP ABL Facility requires us to, among other things, maintain certain minimum liquidity requirements, and receive approval of a plan of reorganization or sale of substantially all of our assets through the Chapter 11 process pursuant to certain agreed upon deadlines. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control and our failure to comply could result in an event of default under the DIP ABL Facility and DIP Term Facility. On September 8, 2020, the lenders under the DIP ABL Facility agreed to extend the deadline contained in the court order approving the DIP ABL Credit Agreement for filing a plan of reorganization or motion to sell substantially all of our assets to September 17, 2020. On September 9, 2020, the committee for the unsecured creditors in the Chapter 11 Cases filed an objection with the Bankruptcy Court asserting the extension was not valid. The Company believes the objection is without merit and intends to vigorously oppose the objection.\nWe have substantial liquidity needs and may not be able to obtain sufficient liquidity during the pendency of the Chapter 11 proceedings or to confirm a plan of reorganization or liquidation.\nIn addition to the cash requirements necessary to fund ongoing operations, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant professional fees and other costs in connection with our Chapter 11 proceedings. While we believe the DIP ABL Facility and the DIP Term Facility will provide sufficient liquidity to fund anticipated cash requirements through the Chapter 11 proceedings, there can be no assurance that our liquidity will be sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations related to the Chapter 11 Cases or to pursue confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization or plan of liquidation. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to secure additional interim financing or exit financing sufficient to meet our liquidity needs or, if sufficient funds are available, offered to us on acceptable terms.\nWe may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in our Chapter 11 proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bankruptcy Code provides that the confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to confirmation. With few exceptions, all claims that arose prior to confirmation of the plan of reorganization (i) would be subject to compromise and/or treatment under the plan of reorganization and (ii) would be discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the plan of reorganization. Any claims not ultimately discharged through a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization could be asserted against the reorganized entities and may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations on a post-reorganization basis.\nOur financial results may be volatile and may not reflect historical trends.\nDuring the Chapter 11 Cases, we expect our financial results to continue to be volatile as asset impairments, restructuring activities and expenses, contract terminations and rejections, and claims assessments may significantly impact our consolidated financial performance. As a result, our historical financial performance is likely not indicative of our financial performance after the Petition Date.\nIn addition, if we emerge from Chapter 11, the amounts reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements may materially change relative to historical consolidated financial statements, including as a result of revisions to our operating plans pursuant to a plan of reorganization. We also may be required to adopt fresh start accounting, in which case our assets and liabilities will be recorded at fair value as of the fresh start reporting date, which may differ materially from the recorded values of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our financial results after the application of fresh start accounting also may be different from historical trends.\nOperating in bankruptcy for a long period of time may harm our business.\nA long period of operations under Bankruptcy Court protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. So long as the proceedings related to the Chapter 11 Cases continue, senior management will be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort dealing with the reorganization instead of focusing exclusively on business operations. A prolonged period of operating under Bankruptcy Court protection also may make it more difficult to retain management and other key personnel necessary to the success of our business. In addition, the longer the proceedings related to the Chapter 11 Cases continue, the more likely it is that customers will lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our business successfully and will seek to establish alternative commercial relationships.\nSo long as the proceedings related to these cases continue, we will be required to incur substantial costs for professional fees and other expenses associated with the administration of the Chapter 11 Cases, including the cost of litigation. In general, litigation can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against. Such litigation could result in settlements or damages that could significantly affect our financial results. It is also possible that certain parties will commence litigation with respect to the treatment of their claims under a plan of reorganization. It is not possible to predict the potential litigation that we may become party to, nor the final resolution of such litigation. The impact of any such litigation on our business and financial stability, however, could be material.\nShould the Chapter 11 proceedings be protracted, we may also need to seek new financing to fund operations. If we are unable to obtain such financing on favorable terms or at all, the chances of successfully reorganizing our business may be seriously jeopardized and the likelihood that we will instead be required to liquidate our assets may increase.\nOutbreaks of communicable disease, or other public health emergencies, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, could substantially harm our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our business operations, store traffic, employee availability, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flow.\nAs of March 25, 2020, we had temporarily closed all of our stores nationwide, severely reducing revenues and resulting in significant operating losses and the elimination of substantially all operating cash flow. Although stores have gradually reopened as allowed by state and local jurisdictions, and all but two of our stores had re-opened by the end of the fiscal year, the scope and duration of this pandemic and the related disruption to our business and financial impacts cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Further impacts may include, but are not limited to, both internal and external impacts to our supply chain, transportation capabilities, staffing ability, and self-insurance costs\nOur customers may also be negatively affected by the consequences of COVID-19, which could negatively impact demand for our products as customers delay, reduce or eliminate discretionary purchases at our stores that have reopened or may reopen. Any significant reduction in customer visits to, and spending at, our stores caused directly or indirectly by COVID-19 would result in a further loss of revenue and cash flows and negatively impact profitability and could result in other material adverse effects.\nThe extent to which the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity is highly uncertain and difficult to predict considering the rapidly evolving environment and will depend on future developments, including the potential further geographic spread and duration of the ongoing pandemic, the severity, containment, and management of the virus and the actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.\nChanges in economic and political conditions may adversely affect consumer spending, which could significantly harm our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe success of our business depends, to a significant extent, upon the level of consumer spending. A number of factors beyond our control affect the level of consumer spending on merchandise that we offer, including, among other things:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nunemployment;\n\u2022\nthe housing market;\n\u2022\ndeterioration in consumer confidence;\n\u2022\ncrude oil prices that affect gasoline and diesel fuel, as well as, increases in other fuels used to support utilities;\n\u2022\nefforts by our customers to reduce personal debt levels;\n\u2022\navailability of consumer credit;\n\u2022\ninterest rates;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the financial markets;\n\u2022\ntax rates, tariffs and policies;\n\u2022\nwar, terrorism and other hostilities; and\n\u2022\nconsumer confidence in future economic conditions.\nThe merchandise we sell generally consists of discretionary items. Reduced consumer confidence and spending cut backs may result in reduced demand for our merchandise, including discretionary items, and may force us to take significant inventory markdowns. Reduced demand also may require increased selling and promotional expenses. Adverse economic conditions and any related decrease in consumer demand for our merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nFailure to identify and respond to changes in consumer trends and preferences could significantly harm our business.\nThe retail home furnishings and housewares industry is subject to sudden shifts in consumer trends and consumer spending. Our sales and results of operations depend in part on our ability to predict or respond to changes in trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. Although our business model allows us greater flexibility than many traditional retailers to meet consumer preferences and trends, we may not successfully do so. Any sustained failure to anticipate, identify and respond to emerging trends in consumer preferences could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nOur sales depend on a volume of traffic to our stores, and a reduction in traffic to, or the closing of, anchor tenants and other destination retailers in the shopping centers in which our stores are located could significantly reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory.\nMost of our stores are located in shopping centers that benefit from varied and complementary tenants, whether specialty or mass retailers, and other destination retailers and attractions to generate sufficient levels of consumer traffic near our stores. Any decline in the volume of consumer traffic at shopping centers, whether because of consumer preferences to shop on the internet or at large warehouse stores, an economic slowdown, a decline in the popularity of shopping centers, the closing of anchor stores or other destination retailers or otherwise, could result in reduced sales at our stores and leave us with excess inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results or business.\nWe must continuously attract buying opportunities for off-price merchandise and anticipate consumer demand as off-price merchandise becomes available, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our performance.\nBy their nature, specific off-price merchandise items are available from manufacturers or vendors generally on a non-recurring basis. As a result, we do not have long-term contracts with our vendors for supply, pricing or access to products, but make individual purchase decisions, which may be for large quantities. Due to economic uncertainties, some of our manufacturers and suppliers may cease operations or may otherwise become unable to continue supplying off-price merchandise on terms acceptable to us. We cannot assure that manufacturers or vendors will continue to make off-price merchandise available to us in quantities acceptable to us or that our buyers will continue to identify and take advantage of appropriate buying opportunities. In addition, if we misjudge consumer demand for products, we may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced to take significant markdowns and miss opportunities to sell more popular products. An inability to acquire suitable off-price merchandise in the future or to accurately anticipate consumer demand for such merchandise would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur results of operations will be negatively affected if we are not successful in managing our inventory profitably.\nInventory is one of the largest assets on our balance sheet and represented approximately 23% of our total assets at June 30, 2020 and 64% at June 30, 2019. Our inventory balance at June 30, 2020 is significantly lower than the prior year due to the COVID-19 disruption to our supply chain operations. Also impacting the lower percentage for fiscal 2020 is the adoption of ASC 842 at the beginning of the fiscal year, which resulted in recognizing operating lease right-of-use assets on our balance sheet in the current year. Inventory at June 30, 2020 represented 47% of total assets excluding our operating lease right-of use assets at that same date. Efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success and profitability. To be successful, we must maintain sufficient inventory levels to meet our customers\u2019 demands without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the costs to store and hold the goods unduly impact our financial results. If our buying decisions do not accurately predict customer trends or purchasing actions, we may have to take unanticipated markdowns to dispose of the excess inventory, which also can adversely impact our financial results. We continue to focus on ways to reduce these risks, but we cannot assure that we will be successful in our inventory management. If we are not successful in managing our inventory balances, our results of operations may be negatively affected. We have recorded significant inventory write-downs from time to time in the past and there can be no assurances that we will not record additional inventory charges in the future.\nOur results of operations will be negatively affected if we are unsuccessful in effectively managing our supply chain operations.\nWith few exceptions, all inventory is shipped directly from suppliers to our distribution network, including our Dallas distribution center along with bypass and pool point facilities, where the inventory is then processed, sorted and shipped to our stores. We depend in large part on the orderly operation of this receiving and distribution process, which depends, in turn, on adherence to shipping schedules and effective management of our distribution centers. We may not anticipate all of the changing demands which our operations will impose on our receiving and distribution system.\nThe loss of, disruption in operations of, or increased costs in the operation of our distribution center facilities would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nEvents beyond our control, such as disruptions in operations due to fire or other catastrophic events, labor disagreements or shipping problems, may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores. We also cannot assure that our insurance will be sufficient, or that insurance proceeds will be paid to us in a timely manner, in the event a distribution center is shut down for any reason. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and impact to our business, we have announced that we will be closing our Phoenix distribution center. We expect the closure to be completed in early fiscal 2021 and there can be no assurance there will be no delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores.\nThe unplanned loss or departure of one or more members of our senior management or other key management could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur future performance will depend in large part upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management and other key employees. The loss of service of these persons could have a material adverse effect on our business and future prospects. We do not maintain key person life insurance for our senior management. We cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience future turnover related to our senior management team.\nOur business is intensely competitive, and a number of different competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe retail home furnishings and housewares industry is intensely competitive. As an off-price retailer of home furnishings and housewares, we currently compete against a diverse group of retailers, including department stores and discount stores, specialty, on-line, and catalog retailers and mass merchants, which sell, among other products, home furnishing, houseware and related products similar and often identical to those we sell. We also compete in particular markets with a substantial number of retailers that specialize in one or more types of home furnishing and houseware products that we sell. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial resources that may, among other things, increase their ability to purchase inventory at lower costs or to initiate and sustain aggressive price competition.\nA number of different competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, including:\n\u2022\nincreased operational efficiencies of competitors;\n\u2022\ncompetitive pricing strategies, including deep discount pricing by a broad range of retailers during periods of poor consumer confidence or economic uncertainty;\n\u2022\ncontinued and prolonged promotional activity by competitors;\n\u2022\nliquidation sales by a number of our competitors who have filed or may file in the future for bankruptcy;\n\u2022\nexpansion by existing competitors;\n\u2022\nentry of new competitors into markets in which we currently operate; and\n\u2022\nadoption by existing competitors of innovative store formats or retail sales methods.\nWe cannot assure that we will be able to continue to compete successfully with our existing or new competitors, or that prolonged periods of deep discount pricing by our competitors will not materially harm our business. We compete for customers, employees, locations, merchandise, services and other important aspects of our business with many other local, regional, national and international retailers. We also face competition from alternative retail distribution channels such as catalogs and, increasingly, e-commerce websites and mobile device applications. Changes in the merchandising, pricing and promotional activities of those competitors, and in the retail industry, in general, may adversely affect our performance.\nIf we are unable to maintain and protect our information technology systems and technologies, we could suffer disruptions in our business, damage to our reputation, increased costs and liability, and obstacles to our growth.\nThe operation of our business is heavily dependent upon the implementation, integrity, security, and successful functioning of our computer networks and information systems, including the point-of-sale systems in our stores, data centers that process transactions, and various software applications used in our operations. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from weather events, power outages, telecommunications or computer failures, computer viruses, security breaches, employee errors and similar occurrences. A failure of our systems to operate effectively as a result of damage to, interruption, or failure of any of these systems could result in data loss, a failure to meet our reporting obligations, or material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements, or cause losses due to disruption of our business operations and loss of customer confidence. These adverse situations could also lead to loss of sales or profits or cause us to incur additional repair, replacement and development costs. Our inability to improve our information technology systems and technologies may fail to support our growth and may limit opportunities.\nIncreases in fuel prices and changes in transportation industry regulations or conditions may increase our freight costs and thus our cost of sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nOur freight costs are impacted by changes in fuel prices through surcharges. Fuel prices and surcharges affect freight costs both on inbound shipments from vendors and outbound shipments to our stores. In addition, the U.S. government requires drivers of over-the-road trucks to take certain rest periods which reduces the available amount of time they can drive during a 24-hour period. Changes in trucking industry conditions, such as truck driver shortages and highway congestion, could increase freight costs. High fuel prices or surcharges, as well as stringent driver regulations and changes in transportation industry conditions, may increase freight costs and thereby increase our cost of sales.\nAn increase in the cost or a disruption in the flow of our imported products may significantly decrease our sales and profits.\nMerchandise manufactured and imported from overseas represents the majority of our total product purchases acquired both domestically and internationally. A disruption in the shipping of imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those products may significantly decrease our sales and profits. In addition, if imported merchandise becomes more expensive or unavailable, the transition to alternative sources may not occur in time to meet our demands. Products from alternative sources may also be of lesser quality and more expensive than those we currently import.\nRisks associated with our reliance on imported products include disruptions in the shipping and importation or increases in the costs of imported products because of factors such as:\n\u2022\nraw material shortages;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages;\n\u2022\nstrikes and political unrest;\n\u2022\nproblems with oceanic shipping, including shipping container shortages;\n\u2022\nincreased customs inspections of import shipments or other factors causing delays in shipments;\n\u2022\nmerchandise quality or safety issues;\n\u2022\neconomic crises;\n\u2022\ninternational disputes, wars, and terrorism;\n\u2022\nloss of \u201cmost favored nation\u201d trading status by the United States in relation to a particular foreign country;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters;\n\u2022\nimport duties and tariffs;\n\u2022\nforeign government regulations;\n\u2022\nimport quotas and other trade sanctions; and\n\u2022\nincreases in shipping rates.\nThe products we buy abroad are sometimes priced in foreign currencies and, therefore, we are affected by fluctuating exchange rates. We might not be able to successfully protect ourselves in the future against currency rate fluctuations, and our financial performance could suffer as a result.\nChanges to federal tax policy may adversely impact our operations and financial performance.\nChanges in U.S. tax or trade policy regarding merchandise produced in other countries could adversely affect our business. Changes in U.S. tariffs, quotas, trade relationships or tax provisions that reduce the supply or increase the relative cost of goods produced in other countries could increase our cost of goods and/or increase our effective tax rate. Although such changes would have implications across the entire industry, we may fail to effectively adapt and to manage the adjustments in strategy that would be necessary in response to those changes. In addition to the general uncertainty and overall risk from potential changes in U.S. laws and policies, as we make business decisions in the face of uncertainty as to potential changes, we may incorrectly anticipate the outcomes, miss out on business opportunities, or fail to effectively adapt our business strategies and manage the adjustments that are necessary in response to those changes. These risks could adversely affect our revenues, increase our effective tax rates, and reduce our profitability.\nOur success depends upon our marketing, advertising and promotional efforts. If our marketing spend is inadequate, if we fail to implement programs successfully, or if our competitors are more effective than we are, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nHistorically, we have used marketing and promotional programs to attract customers to our stores and to encourage purchases by our customers. We use various media for our promotional efforts, including email, direct mail, newspaper inserts, digital video, digital display, search and social networks. In fiscal 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we reduced our marketing spend, and anticipate spending at a reduced level for an unknown period of time. If we are unable to increase our marketing spend appropriately, our business may suffer. If we fail to choose the appropriate medium for our efforts, or fail to implement and execute new marketing opportunities, our competitors may be able to attract some of our customers and cause them to decrease purchases from us and increase purchases elsewhere, which would negatively impact our net sales. Changes in the amount and degree of promotional intensity or merchandising strategy by our competitors could cause us to have some difficulties in retaining existing customers and attracting new customers.\nIf we do not attract, train and retain quality employees in appropriate numbers, including key employees and management, our performance could be adversely affected.\nOur performance is dependent on recruiting, developing, training and retaining quality sales, distribution center and other employees in large numbers, as well as, experienced buying and management personnel. Many of our store employees are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors, such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation, and changes in rules governing eligibility for overtime and changing demographics. In the event of increasing wage rates, if we do not increase our wages competitively, our staffing levels and customer service could suffer because of a declining quality of our workforce, or our earnings would decrease if we increase our wage rates, whether in response to market demands or new minimum wage legislation. Changes that adversely impact our ability to attract and retain quality employees and management personnel could adversely affect our performance.\nOur results of operations are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or the market price of our common stock.\nOur business is subject to seasonality with a higher level of net sales and operating income generated during the quarter ended December 31, which includes the holiday shopping season. Net sales in the quarters ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 accounted for approximately 37%, 34% and 33% of our annual net sales for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For more information about our seasonality, please read Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Quarterly Results and Seasonality.\u201d\nBecause a significant percentage of our net sales and operating income are generated in the quarter ending December 31, we have limited ability to compensate for shortfalls in December quarter sales or earnings by changes in our operations or strategies in other quarters. A significant shortfall in results for the quarter ending December 31 of any year could have a material adverse effect on our annual results of operations and on the market price of our common stock. In addition, in anticipation of higher sales during this period, we purchase substantial amounts of seasonal inventory and hire many temporary employees. An excess of seasonal merchandise inventory could result if our net sales during this principal selling season were to fall below either seasonal norms or expectations. If our December quarter sales results are substantially below expectations, our financial performance and operating results could be adversely affected by unanticipated markdowns, particularly in seasonal merchandise. Lower than anticipated sales in the principal selling season would also negatively affect our ability to absorb the increased seasonal labor costs.\nOur quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly based on additional factors, such as:\n\u2022\nthe amount of net sales contributed by new and existing stores;\n\u2022\nthe timing of certain holidays and advertised events;\n\u2022\nchanges in our merchandise mix and inventory levels;\n\u2022\nthe timing of new store openings;\n\u2022\nthe success of our store relocation program;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and weather conditions that affect consumer spending; and\n\u2022\nactions of competitors, including promotional activity.\nThese factors could also have a material adverse effect on our annual results of operations and on the market price of our common stock.\nIf we fail to protect the security of information about our business and our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees, we could damage our reputation and our business, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation and government investigations and enforcement actions.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, on our computer networks and information systems. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure and that of our service providers may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Any such attack or breach could compromise our security and remain undetected for a period of time, and confidential information could be misappropriated, resulting in a loss of customers\u2019, suppliers\u2019, business partners\u2019 or employees\u2019 personal information, negative publicity, harm to our business and reputation, and potentially causing us to incur costs to reimburse third parties for damages and potentially subjecting us to government investigations and enforcement actions. In addition, the regulatory environment surrounding data and information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, as new and revised requirements are frequently imposed across our business. Compliance with more demanding privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes, and implementing new initiatives could result in system disruptions. We maintain cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses from any future breaches of our systems.\nWe are subject to various government regulations, changes in the existing laws and regulations and new laws and regulations which may adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\nThe development and operation of our stores are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in many areas of our business, including, but not limited to, those that impose restrictions, levy a fee or tax, or require a permit or license, or other regulatory approval, and building and zoning requirements. Difficulties or failures in obtaining required permits, licenses or other regulatory approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new store, and the suspension of, or inability to renew, a license or permit could interrupt operations at an existing store. We are also subject to laws governing our relationship with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, and other state and federal wage and hour regulations, regulations governing leaves of absence, health insurance mandates, working and safety conditions, and immigration status requirements. Additionally, changes in federal labor laws could result in portions of our workforce being subjected to greater organized labor influence. This could result in an increase to our labor costs. A significant portion of our store personnel are paid at rates related to the minimum wage established by federal, state and municipal law. Additionally, we are subject to certain laws and regulations that govern our handling of customers\u2019 personal information. A failure to protect the integrity and security of our customers\u2019 personal information could expose us to private litigation and government investigations and enforcement actions, as well as materially damage our reputation with our customers. While we endeavor to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, governmental and regulatory bodies may change such laws and regulations in the future which may require us to incur substantial cost increases. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to various sanctions, penalties or fines and may be required to cease operations until we achieve compliance which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results and operations.\nWe face risks to our corporate reputation from our customers, employees and other third parties.\nDamage to our corporate reputation could adversely affect our sales results and profitability. Our reputation is partially based on perception. Any incident that erodes the trust or confidence of our customers or the general public could adversely affect our reputation and operating performance, particularly if the incident results in significant adverse publicity or governmental inquiry. An incident could include alleged acts, or omissions by, or situations involving our vendors, our landlords, or our employees outside of work, and may pertain to social or political issues or protests largely unrelated to our business. The use of social media platforms, including blogs, social media websites, and other forms of internet-based communications, which allow individuals access to a broad audience, continues to increase. The opportunity for dissemination of information, including inaccurate information, is seemingly limitless and readily available. Information concerning our Company may be posted on such platforms at any time. Information posted may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate, which could negatively affect our sales and profitability, diminish customer trust, reduce employee morale and productivity, and lead to difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified employees. The harm may be immediate, without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.\nWe face litigation risks from customers, employees, and other third parties in the ordinary course of business.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation by customers, current and former employees, suppliers, stockholders and others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions, or other litigation. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend future litigation may be significant. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease customer acceptance of merchandise offerings, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable.\nWe face risks with respect to product liability claims and product recalls, which could adversely affect our reputation, our business, and our consolidated results of operations.\nWe purchase merchandise from third parties and offer this merchandise to customers for sale. Merchandise could be subject to recalls and other actions by regulatory authorities. Changes in laws and regulations could also impact the type of merchandise we offer to customers. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, issues that result in recalls of merchandise. In addition, in the past, individuals have asserted claims, and may in the future assert claims, that they have sustained injuries from third-party merchandise offered by us, and we may be subject to future lawsuits relating to these claims. There is a risk that these claims or liabilities may exceed, or fall outside the scope of, our insurance coverage. Any of the issues mentioned above could result in damage to our reputation, diversion of development and management resources, or reduced sales and increased costs, any of which could harm our business.\nOur stores may be adversely affected by local conditions, natural disasters, and other events.\nCertain regions in which our stores are located may be subject to adverse local conditions, natural disasters, and other events. If severe weather, such as heavy snowfall or extreme temperatures, discourages or restricts customers in a particular region from traveling to our stores, our sales could be adversely affected. If severe weather conditions occur during the second quarter of our fiscal year, the adverse impact to our sales and profitability could be even greater than at other times during the year because we generate a significant portion of our sales and profits during this period. Natural disasters including tornados, hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes may damage our stores, corporate office, and distribution facilities or other operations, which may adversely affect our financial results. Additionally, demographic shifts in the areas where our stores are located could adversely impact our financial results and operations.\nOur results of operations may be negatively affected by inventory shrinkage.\nWe are subject to the risk of inventory loss and theft. Although our inventory shrinkage rates have not fluctuated significantly in recent years, we cannot assure that actual rates of inventory loss and theft in the future will be within our estimates or that the measures we are taking will effectively reduce the problem of inventory shrinkage. Although some level of inventory shrinkage is an unavoidable cost of doing business, if we were to experience higher rates of inventory shrinkage or incur increased security costs to combat inventory theft, our results of operations could be affected adversely.\nOur results of operations may be negatively impacted by exposure to unexpected costs related to our insurance programs.\nOur insurance coverage is subject to deductibles, self-insured retentions, limits of liability and similar provisions that we believe are prudent based on our overall operations. We may incur certain types of losses that we cannot insure or which we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to acts of war and terrorism, employee and certain other crime, and some natural disasters. If we incur these losses and they are material, our business could suffer. Certain material events may result in sizable losses for the insurance industry and adversely impact the availability of adequate insurance coverage or result in excessive premium increases. To offset negative cost trends in the insurance market, we may elect to self-insure, accept higher deductibles or reduce the amount of coverage in response to these market changes. In addition, we self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers\u2019 compensation, general liability, and group health insurance programs. Unanticipated changes in any applicable actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our recorded liabilities for these self-insured losses, including potential increases in medical and indemnity costs, could result in significantly different expenses than expected under these programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Although we continue to maintain property insurance for catastrophic events, we are self-insured for losses up to the amount of our deductibles. If we experience a greater number of self-insured losses than we anticipate, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to customer payment-related risks that could increase operating costs or exposure to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business.\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, credit and debit cards, gift cards, gift certificates, store credits, and digital wallets. Acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. In October 2015, the payment card industry shifted liability for certain debit and credit card transactions to retailers who are not able to accept EMV chip technology transactions. Any disruption to our ability to accept EMV chip technology transactions may subject us to increased risk of liability for fraudulent transactions and may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nFor certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could potentially disrupt our business. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals, who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. If we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept, or if payment-related data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired. In addition, our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs. As a result, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, which could result in a loss of investor confidence and negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud. As further described in Part II Item 9A \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Annual Report, management has concluded that, because of a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to ineffective assessment of impairment of long-lived assets, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2020. Specifically, management\u2019s estimation of fair value did not appropriately utilize market participant assumptions, which was identified and corrected prior to filing. The material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. We cannot be certain that these measures will be successful or that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses. Any remediation efforts additionally may require us to incur unanticipated costs for various professional fees and services. Material inaccuracies in our financial statements would damage their value to management and our Board of Directors in making decisions as to the operation of our business, could harm our reputation and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information.", "PERMNO": 86866, "SIC": 5331, "TIC": "TUESQ"}
