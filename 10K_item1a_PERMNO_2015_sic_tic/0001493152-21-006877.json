Risk Factors.\nThe following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the information in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Our Business\nWe may need additional capital to complete future acquisitions, conduct our operations, and fund our business, and our ability to obtain the necessary funding is uncertain.\nWe may need to raise additional funding to complete future potential acquisitions and will be required to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing or other various means to fund our operations and complete workovers and acquire assets. In such a case, adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms. If we need to raise additional funds in the future by issuing equity securities, dilution to existing stockholders will result, and such securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of our common stock. If funding is insufficient at any time in the future and we are unable to generate sufficient revenue from new business arrangements, to complete future acquisitions or operations, our results of operations and the value of our securities could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, due to the nature of oil and gas interests, i.e., that rates of production generally decline over time as oil and gas reserves are depleted, if we are unable to acquire additional properties and/or develop our reserves, either because we are unable to raise sufficient funding for such development activities, or otherwise, or in the event we are unable to acquire additional operated or non-operated properties, we believe that our revenues will continue to decline over time. Furthermore, in the event we are unable to raise additional required funding in the future, we will not be able to participate in the drilling of additional wells, will not be able to complete other drilling and/or workover activities.\nIf this were to happen, we may be forced to scale back our business plan which could result in the value of our outstanding securities declining in value.\nOil, natural gas liquids (NGL) and natural gas prices, are volatile and declines in the prices of such commodities have in the past, and will continue in the future to, adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations or targets and financial commitments.\nThe price of oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas and NGLs, heavily influences our revenue, profitability, cash flows, liquidity, access to capital, present value and quality of our reserves, the nature and scale of our operations, and our future rate of growth. Oil, NGL, and natural gas are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. In recent years, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile. These markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future. Further, oil prices and natural gas prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relation to each other. The price of crude oil has experienced significant volatility over the last five years, with the price of a barrel of oil dropping below $20 during the early part of 2020, due in part to reduced global demand stemming from the recent global COVID-19 outbreak, and only recently increasing to around $55-65 a barrel. A prolonged period of low market prices for oil and natural gas, or further declines in the market prices for oil and natural gas, will likely result in capital expenditures being further curtailed and will adversely affect our business, financial condition and liquidity. Additionally, lower oil and natural gas prices have, and may in the future, cause, a decline in our stock price. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the daily Cushing, Oklahoma West Texas Intermediate (\u201cWTI\u201d) oil spot price ranged from a high of $66.24 per barrel (Bbl) to a low of $46.31 per Bbl and the NYMEX natural gas Henry Hub spot price ranged from a high of $4.25 per one million British Thermal Units (MMBtu) to a low of $1.75 per MMBtu. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the daily WTI oil spot price ranged from a high of $63.27 per Bbl to a low of ($36.98) per Bbl and the NYMEX natural gas Henry Hub spot price ranged from a high of $3.14 per MMBtu to a low of $1.33 per MMBtu.\nDeclines in the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas can also adversely affect our ability to finance capital expenditures, make acquisitions, raise capital and satisfy our financial obligations. In addition, declines in prices can reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically and the estimated future cash flow from that production and, as a result, adversely affect the quantity and present value of our proved reserves. Among other things, a reduction in the amount or present value of our reserves can limit the capital available to us, and the availability of other sources of capital likely will be based to a significant degree on the estimated quantity and value of the reserves.\nAs described above, oil, NGLs, and natural gas are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the commodities market has been volatile. An extended period of continued lower oil prices, or additional price declines, will have further adverse effects on us. The prices we receive for any future production and the prices received from operators of our NAPA non-operated production, and the levels of such production, will continue to depend on numerous factors, including the following:\n\u25cf the domestic and foreign supply of oil, NGLs, and natural gas;\n\u25cf the domestic and foreign demand for oil, NGLs, and natural gas;\n\u25cf the prices and availability of competitors\u2019 supplies of oil, NGLs, and natural gas;\n\u25cf the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and state-controlled oil companies relating to oil price and production controls;\n\u25cf the price and quantity of foreign imports of oil, NGLs, and natural gas;\n\u25cf the impact of U.S. dollar exchange rates on oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices;\n\u25cf domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;\n\u25cf speculative trading of oil, NGLs, and natural gas futures contracts;\n\u25cf localized supply and demand fundamentals, including the availability, proximity, and capacity of gathering and transportation systems for natural gas;\n\u25cf the availability of refining capacity;\n\u25cf the prices and availability of alternative fuel sources;\n\u25cf the threat, or perceived threat, or results, of viral pandemics, for example, as currently being experienced with the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u25cf political conditions in or affecting oil, NGLs, and natural gas producing regions, including the Middle East and South America;\n\u25cf the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military action and civil unrest;\n\u25cf public pressure on, and legislative and regulatory interest within, federal, state, and local governments to stop, significantly limit, or regulate hydraulic fracturing activities;\n\u25cf the level of global oil, NGL, and natural gas inventories and exploration and production activity;\n\u25cf authorization of exports from the United States of liquefied natural gas;\n\u25cf the impact of energy conservation efforts;\n\u25cf technological advances affecting energy consumption; and\n\u25cf overall worldwide economic conditions.\nDeclines in oil, NGL, or natural gas prices will reduce not only our revenue but also the amount of oil, NGL, and natural gas that we, and the operators of our properties, can produce economically. Should natural gas, NGL or oil prices decline in the future, our non-operated wells and/or any of our own wells, may be forced to be shut-in, and exploration and development plans for prospects and exploration or development activities may need to be postponed or abandoned. As a result, we may have to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, each of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe operators of our Williston Basin wells previously temporarily shut-in such wells to preserve oil and gas reserves for production during a more favorable oil price environment, and while such wells have resumed production, our wells may again be shut-in, should market conditions significantly deteriorate.\nIn early March 2020, there was a global outbreak of COVID-19 that resulted in a drastic decline in global demand of certain mineral and energy products including crude oil. As a result of the lower demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the oversupply of crude oil, spot and future prices of crude oil fell to historic lows during the second quarter of 2020. Operators in North Dakota\u2019s Williston Basin (including the operators of our wells) responded by significantly decreasing drilling and completion activity and shutting in or curtailing production from a significant number of producing wells. Operators decisions on these matters are changing rapidly and it is difficult to predict the future effects on the Company\u2019s business. Lower oil and natural gas prices not only decrease our revenues, but an extended decline in oil or gas prices may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial position, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, and ability to finance planned capital expenditures. While our producing wells are shut-in, we do not generate revenues from such wells, and would need to use our cash on hand and funds we receive from borrowings and the sale of equity in order to pay our operating expenses. A continued period of low-priced oil may make it non-economical for our wells to operate, which would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and the value of our assets. We cannot estimate the future price of oil, and as such cannot estimate, when our wells may again be shut-in by their operators.\nOur business and operations have been adversely affected by, and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by, the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be adversely affected by other similar outbreaks.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or other adverse public health developments, including voluntary and mandatory quarantines, travel restrictions, and other restrictions, our operations, and those of our subcontractors, customers, and suppliers, have and are anticipated to continue to experience delays or disruptions and temporary suspensions of operations. In addition, our financial condition and results of operations have been and are likely to continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe timeline and potential magnitude of the COVID-19 outbreak are currently unknown. The continuation or amplification of this virus could continue to more broadly affect the United States and global economy, including our business and operations, and the demand for oil and gas. For example, the outbreak of coronavirus has resulted in a widespread health crisis that will adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that will affect our operating results. Other contagious diseases in the human population could have similar adverse effects. In addition, the effects of COVID-19 and concerns regarding its global spread have recently negatively impacted the domestic and international demand for crude oil and natural gas, which has contributed to price volatility, impacted the price we receive for oil and natural gas, and has materially and adversely affected the demand for and marketability of our production, and is anticipated to continue to adversely affect the same for the foreseeable future. As the potential impact from COVID-19 is difficult to predict, the extent to which it will negatively affect our operating results, or the duration of any potential business disruption is uncertain. The magnitude and duration of any impact will depend on future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the severity and duration of COVID-19 and the actions taken by authorities to contain it or treat its impact, all of which are beyond our control.\nDeclining general economic, business or industry conditions have, and will continue to have, a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition, and are expected to continue having a material adverse effect for the foreseeable future.\nConcerns over global economic conditions, the threat of pandemic diseases and the results thereof, energy costs, geopolitical issues, inflation, the availability and cost of credit, the United States mortgage market, and a declining real estate market in the United States have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. These factors, combined with volatile prices of oil and natural gas, declining business and consumer confidence, and increased unemployment, have precipitated an economic slowdown and a recession, which could expand to a global depression. Concerns about global economic growth have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices and are expected to continue having a material adverse effect for the foreseeable future. If the economic climate in the United States or abroad continues to deteriorate, demand for petroleum products could diminish, which could further impact the price at which our operators can sell oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, affect the ability of our vendors, suppliers and customers to continue operations, and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition to a greater extent than it has already.\nThe development of oil and natural gas properties involves substantial risks that may result in a total loss of investment.\nThe business of exploring for, working over and developing natural gas and oil properties involves a high degree of business and financial risk, and thus a significant risk of loss of initial investment that even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome. The cost and timing of drilling, workover completing and operating wells is often uncertain. Factors which can delay or prevent drilling or production, or otherwise impact expected results, include but are not limited to:\n\u25cf unexpected drilling conditions;\n\u25cf inability to obtain required permits from governmental authorities;\n\u25cf inability to obtain, or limitations on, easements from landowners;\n\u25cf uncertainty regarding our operating partners\u2019 drilling schedules;\n\u25cf high pressure or irregularities in geologic formations;\n\u25cf equipment failures;\n\u25cf title problems;\n\u25cf fires, explosions, blowouts, cratering, pollution, spills and other environmental risks or accidents;\n\u25cf changes in government regulations and issuance of local drilling restrictions or moratoria;\n\u25cf adverse weather;\n\u25cf reductions in commodity prices;\n\u25cf pipeline ruptures; and\n\u25cf unavailability or high cost of equipment, field services and labor.\nA productive well may become uneconomic in the event unusual quantities of water or other non-commercial substances are encountered in the well bore that impair or prevent production. We may participate in wells that are or become unproductive or, though productive, do not produce in economic quantities. In addition, even commercial wells can produce less, or have higher costs, than we projected.\nIn addition, initial 24-hour or other limited-duration production rates announced regarding our oil and natural gas properties are not necessarily indicative of future production rates.\nDry holes and other unsuccessful or uneconomic exploration, exploitation and development activities can adversely affect our cash flow, profitability and financial condition, and can adversely affect our reserves. We do not currently operate the majority of our properties, and therefore have limited ability to control the manner in which drilling and other exploration and development activities on our non-operated properties are conducted, which may increase these risks.\nThe Williston Basin (Bakken and Three Forks shales) oil price differential could have adverse impacts on our revenue.\nGenerally, crude oil produced from the Bakken formation in North Dakota is high quality (36 to 44 degrees API, which is comparable to West Texas Intermediate Crude (\u201cWTI\u201d)). During 2020, our weighted average realized oil price in the Williston Basin was $32.63, which due to transportation costs was approximately $6.60 per barrel less than the average WTI spot price for crude oil. This discount, or differential, may widen in the future, which would reduce the price we receive for our production. We may also be adversely affected by widening differentials in other areas of operation.\nDrilling and completion costs for the wells we drill in the Williston Basin are comparable to or higher than other areas where there is no price differential. This makes it more likely that a downturn in oil prices will result in a ceiling limitation write-down of our oil and natural gas properties. A widening of the differential would reduce the cash flow from our Williston Basin properties and adversely impact our ability to participate fully in drilling. Our production in other areas could also be affected by adverse changes in differentials. In addition, changes in differentials could make it more difficult for us to effectively hedge our exposure to changes in commodity prices.\nOur former Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board of Directors received expense reimbursements without adequate backup, and we paid certain vehicle expenses on behalf of an entity affiliated with John Hoffman, a former director, both of which may be deemed violations of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and/or other federal securities laws.\nOur internal control testing identified inadequate supporting documentation and lack of adequate review for certain travel advances and expense reimbursements.\nFollowing the termination of David Veltri, our former Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman, our Audit Committee conducted a review of Company procedures, policies and practices, including travel expense advancements and reimbursements. Our Audit Committee retained independent counsel and an advisory firm with forensic accounting expertise to assist the Audit Committee in conducting the investigation. As part of the investigation, the Audit Committee reviewed our financial policies and procedures, including management expenses. The Audit Committee concluded that Mr. Veltri did not produce receipts with adequate detail for a portion of his reimbursed business expenses he received from 2017 to 2019.\nIn 2018 and 2019, we paid approximately $2,350 for vehicle expenses on behalf of an entity affiliated with Mr. Hoffman. While we were reimbursed for these expenses, it is possible that these payments by the Company on behalf of Mr. Hoffman could be deemed to be in violation of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nSection 402 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 prohibits personal loans to a director or executive officer of a public company. If the SEC were to commence an investigation or institute proceedings to enforce a violation of this statute or other federal securities laws as a result of the reimbursement of expenses to Mr. Veltri or the payment of the vehicle expenses associated with an entity owned by an affiliated entity of Mr. Hoffman, we may become a party to litigation or proceedings over these matters, and the outcome of such litigation or proceedings (including criminal, civil or administrative sanctions or penalties by the SEC), alone or in addition to the costs of litigation, may materially and adversely affect our business. We are unable to predict the extent of our ultimate liability with respect to these payments.\nNon-consent provisions could result in penalties and loss of revenues from wells.\nOur industry partners may elect to engage in drilling activities that we are unwilling or unable to participate in during 2021 and thereafter. Our exploration and development agreements contain customary industry non-consent provisions. Pursuant to these provisions, if a well is proposed to be drilled or completed but a working interest owner elects not to participate, the resulting revenues (which otherwise would go to the non-participant) flow to the participants until the participating parties receive from 150% to 300% of the capital they provided to cover the non-participant\u2019s share. In order to be in position to avoid non-consent penalties and to make opportunistic investments in new assets, we will continue to evaluate various options to obtain additional capital, including debt financing, sales of one or more producing or non-producing oil and natural gas assets and the issuance of shares of our common stock.\nUnanticipated costs could require new capital that may not be available.\nThe oil and natural gas business holds the opportunity for significant returns on investment, but achievement of such returns is subject to high risk. For example, initial results from one or more of the oil and natural gas programs could be marginal but warrant investing in more wells. Dry holes, over-budget exploration costs, low commodity prices, or any combination of these or other adverse factors, could result in production revenues falling below projections, thus adversely impacting cash expected to be available for a continued work program, and a reduction in cash available for investment in other programs. These types of events could require a reassessment of priorities and therefore potential re-allocations of existing capital and could also mandate obtaining new capital. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any financing transaction on acceptable terms.\nCompetition may limit our opportunities in the oil and natural gas business.\nThe oil and natural gas business is very competitive. We compete with many public and private exploration and development companies in finding investment opportunities. We also compete with oil and natural gas operators in acquiring acreage positions. Our principal competitors are small to mid-size companies with in-house petroleum exploration and drilling expertise. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours. They also may be willing and able to pay more for oil and natural gas properties than our financial resources permit, and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties. In addition, there is substantial competition in the oil and natural gas industry for investment capital, and we may not be able to compete successfully in raising additional capital if needed.\nSuccessful exploitation of shale formations are subject to risks related to horizontal drilling and completion techniques.\nOperations in shale formations in many cases involve utilizing the latest drilling and completion techniques in an effort to generate the highest possible cumulative recoveries and therefore generate the highest possible returns. Risks that are encountered while drilling include, but are not limited to, landing the well bore in the desired drilling zone, staying in the zone while drilling horizontally through the shale formation, running casing the entire length of the well bore (as applicable to the formation) and being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore.\nFor wells that are hydraulically fractured, completion risks include, but are not limited to, being able to fracture stimulate the planned number of fracture stimulation stages, and successfully cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage. Ultimately, the success of these latest drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficient period of time.\nCosts for any individual well will vary due to a variety of factors. These wells are significantly more expensive than a typical onshore shallow conventional well. Accordingly, unsuccessful exploration or development activity affecting even a small number of wells could have a significant impact on our results of operations. Costs other than drilling and completion costs can also be significant for shale wells.\nIf our access to oil and natural gas markets is restricted, it could negatively impact our production and revenues. Securing access to takeaway capacity may be particularly difficult in less developed areas of the Williston Basin.\nMarket conditions or limited availability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and other midstream facilities. The ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines, rail transportation and processing facilities owned and operated by third parties. In particular, access to adequate gathering systems or pipeline or rail takeaway capacity is limited in the Williston Basin. In order to secure takeaway capacity and related services, we or our operating partners may be forced to enter into arrangements that are not as favorable to operators as those in other areas.\nIf we are unable to replace reserves, we will not be able to sustain production.\nOur future operations depend on our ability to find, develop, and acquire crude oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves that are economically producible. Our properties produce crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs at a declining rate over time. In order to maintain current production rates, we must locate and develop or acquire new crude oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves to replace those being depleted by production. Without successful drilling or acquisition activities, our reserves and production will decline over time. In addition, competition for crude oil and natural gas properties is intense, and many of our competitors have financial, technical, human, and other resources necessary to evaluate and integrate acquisitions that are substantially greater than those available to us.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to make acquisitions. However, suitable acquisition candidates may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable, and acquisitions pose substantial risks to our business, financial condition and results of operations. In pursuing acquisitions, we compete with other companies, many of which have greater financial and other resources than we do. In the event we do complete an acquisition, its successful impact on our business will depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include the purchase price for the acquisition, future crude oil, natural gas, and NGL prices, the ability to reasonably estimate or assess the recoverable volumes of reserves, rates of future production and future net revenues attainable from reserves, future operating and capital costs, results of future exploration, exploitation, and development activities on the acquired properties, and future abandonment and possible future environmental or other liabilities. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves, actual future production rates, and associated costs and potential liabilities with respect to prospective acquisition targets. Actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. A customary review of subject properties will not necessarily reveal all existing or potential problems.\nAdditionally, significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business depending upon the character of the acquired properties if they have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties. To the extent that acquired properties are substantially different than our existing properties, our ability to efficiently realize the expected economic benefits of such transactions may be limited. If we are unable to integrate acquisitions successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems could result.\nIntegrating acquired businesses and properties involves a number of special risks. These risks include the possibility that management may be distracted from regular business concerns by the need to integrate operations and systems and that unforeseen difficulties can arise in integrating operations and systems and in retaining and assimilating employees. Any of these or other similar risks could lead to potential adverse short-term or long-term effects on our operating results and may cause us to not be able to realize any or all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions.\nMany of our joint operating agreements contain provisions that may be subject to legal interpretation, including allocation of non-consent interests, complex payout calculations that impact the timing of reversionary interests, and the impact of joint interest audits.\nSubstantially all of our oil and natural gas interests are subject to joint operating and similar agreements. Some of these agreements include payment provisions that are complex and subject to different interpretations and/or can be erroneously applied in particular situations.\nJoint interest audits are a normal process in our business to ensure that operators adhere to standard industry practices in the billing of costs and expenses related to our oil and natural gas properties. However, the ultimate resolution of joint interest audits can extend over a long period of time in which we attempt to recover excessive amounts charged by the operator. Joint interest audits result in incremental costs for the audit services and we can incur substantial amounts of legal fees to resolve disputes with the operators of our properties.\nWe do not operate most of our drilling locations. Therefore, we will not be able to control the timing of exploration or development efforts, associated costs, or the rate of production of these non-operated assets.\nWe do not currently operate the drilling prospects in South Texas we hold with industry partners. As a non-operator, our ability to exercise influence over the operations of the drilling programs is limited. In the usual case in the oil and natural gas industry, new work is proposed by the operator and often is approved by most of the non-operating parties. If the work is approved by the holders of a majority of the working interests, but we disagree with the proposal and do not (or are unable to) participate, we will forfeit our share of revenues from the well until the participants receive 150% to 300% of their investment. In some cases, we could lose all of our interest in the well. We would avoid a penalty of this kind only if a majority of the working interest owners agree with us and the proposal does not proceed.\nThe success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others depend upon a number of factors outside of our control, including:\n\u25cf the nature and timing of the operator\u2019s drilling and other activities;\n\u25cf the timing and amount of required capital expenditures;\n\u25cf the operator\u2019s geological and engineering expertise and financial resources;\n\u25cf the approval of other participants in drilling wells; and\n\u25cf the operator\u2019s selection of suitable technology.\nThe fact that our industry partners serve as operator makes it more difficult for us to predict future production, cash flows and liquidity needs. Our ability to grow our production and reserves depends on decisions by our partners to drill wells in which we have an interest, and they may elect to reduce or suspend the drilling of those wells.\nOur estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or the relevant underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantity and present value of our reserves.\nOil and natural gas reserve reports are prepared by independent consultants to provide estimates of the quantities of hydrocarbons that can be economically recovered from proved properties, utilizing commodity prices for a trailing 12-month period and taking into account expected capital, operating and other expenditures. These reports also provide estimates of the future net present value of the reserves, which we use for internal planning purposes and for testing the carrying value of the properties on our balance sheet.\nThe reserve data included in this report represents estimates only. Estimating quantities of, and future cash flows from, proved oil and natural gas reserves is a complex process and not an exact science. It requires interpretations of available technical data and various estimates, including estimates based upon assumptions relating to economic factors, such as future production costs; ad valorem, severance and excise taxes; availability of capital; estimates of required capital expenditures, workover and remedial costs; and the assumed effect of governmental regulation. The assumptions underlying our estimates of our proved reserves could prove to be inaccurate, and any significant inaccuracy could materially affect, among other things, future estimates of the reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to the properties, the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery, and estimates of our future net cash flows.\nAt December 31, 2020, 89% of our estimated proved reserves were developed producing and 11% were developed non-producing. Estimation of proved undeveloped reserves and proved developed non-producing reserves is almost always based on analogy to existing wells, volumetric analysis or probabilistic methods, in contrast to the performance data used to estimate producing reserves. Recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations.\nYou should not assume that the present values referred to in this report represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. The timing and success of the production and the expenses related to the development of oil and natural gas properties, each of which is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, will affect the timing and amount of actual future net cash flows from our proved reserves and their present value. In addition, our PV-10 and standardized measure estimates are based on costs as of the date of the estimates and assume fixed commodity prices. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs used in the estimate.\nFurther, the use of a 10% discount factor to calculate PV-10 and standardized measure values may not necessarily represent the most appropriate discount factor given actual interest rates and risks to which our business or the oil and natural gas industry in general are subject.\nThe use of derivative arrangements in oil and natural gas production could result in financial losses or reduce income.\nFrom time to time, we use derivative instruments, typically fixed-rate swaps and costless collars, to manage price risk underlying our oil and natural gas production. For example, on March 9, 2021, we entered into a commodity derivative contract to fix the price of 100 barrels of crude oil per day from March 1 to December 31, 2021 at $61.90, based on the calendar month average of WTI Crude Oil. The fair value of our derivative instruments is marked to market at the end of each quarter and the resulting unrealized gains or losses due to changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments is recognized in current earnings. Accordingly, our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments.\nOur actual future production may be significantly higher or lower than we estimate at the time we enter into derivative contracts for the relevant period. If the actual amount of production is higher than we estimated, we will have greater commodity price exposure than we intended. If the actual amount of production is lower than the notional amount that is subject to our derivative instruments, we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our derivative transactions without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale of the underlying physical commodity, resulting in a substantial diminution of our liquidity. As a result of these factors, our hedging activities may not be as effective as we intend in reducing the volatility of our cash flows, and in certain circumstances may actually increase the volatility of our cash flows.\nDerivative instruments also expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:\n\u25cf the counter-party to the derivative instrument defaults on its contract obligations;\n\u25cf there is an increase in the differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received; or\n\u25cf the steps we take to monitor our derivative financial instruments do not detect and prevent transactions that are inconsistent with our risk management strategies.\nIn addition, depending on the type of derivative arrangements we enter into, the agreements could limit the benefit we would receive from increases in oil prices. It cannot be assumed that the hedging transactions we have entered into, or will enter into, will adequately protect us from fluctuations in commodity prices.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) provides for statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions, including crude oil and natural gas derivative transactions. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for the creation of position limits for certain derivatives transaction, as well as requiring certain transactions to be cleared on exchanges for which cash collateral will be required. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Commodities Futures and Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d), the SEC and other regulators to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe CFTC has finalized other regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s provisions regarding trade reporting, margin, clearing and trade execution; however, some regulations remain to be finalized and it is not possible at this time to predict when the CFTC will adopt final rules. For example, the CFTC has re-proposed regulations setting position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Certain bona fide hedging transactions are expected to be made exempt from these limits. Also, it is possible that under recently adopted margin rules, some registered swap dealers may require us to post initial and variation margins in connection with certain swaps not subject to central clearing.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and any additional implementing regulations could significantly increase the cost of some commodity derivative contracts (including through requirements to post collateral, which could adversely affect our available liquidity), materially alter the terms of some commodity derivative contracts, limit our ability to trade some derivatives to hedge risks, reduce the availability of some derivatives to protect against risks we encounter and reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing commodity derivative contracts. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a consequence, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Increased volatility may make us less attractive to certain types of investors. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. If the implementing regulations result in lower commodity prices, our revenues could be adversely affected. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur acreage must be drilled before lease expiration, generally within three to five years, in order to hold the acreage by production. In the highly competitive market for acreage, failure to drill sufficient wells in order to hold acreage will result in a substantial lease renewal cost, or if renewal is not feasible, the loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities.\nUnless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of our potential drilling locations are identified, the leases for such acreage will expire. The cost to renew such leases may increase significantly, and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The risk that our leases may expire will generally increase when commodity prices fall, as lower prices may cause our operating partners to reduce the number of wells they drill. In addition, on certain portions of our acreage, third-party leases could become immediately effective if our leases expire. As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from our current expectations, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur producing properties are primarily located in the Williston Basin, New Mexico, the Texas Gulf Coast and South Texas, making us vulnerable to risks associated with having operations concentrated in these geographic areas.\nBecause our operations are geographically concentrated in the Williston Basin, New Mexico, the Texas Gulf Coast and South Texas, the success and profitability of our operations may be disproportionally exposed to the effect of regional events. These include, among others, regulatory issues, natural disasters and fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas produced from wells in the region and other regional supply and demand factors, including gathering, pipeline and other transportation capacity constraints, available rigs, equipment, oil field services, supplies, labor and infrastructure capacity. Any of these events has the potential to cause producing wells to be shut-in, delay operations and growth plans, decrease cash flows, increase operating and capital costs and prevent development of lease inventory before expiration. In addition, our operations in the Williston Basin may be adversely affected by seasonal weather and lease stipulations designed to protect wildlife, which can intensify competition for services, infrastructure and equipment during months when drilling is possible and may result in periodic shortages. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nInsurance may be insufficient to cover future liabilities.\nOur business is currently focused on oil and natural gas exploration and development and we also have potential exposure to general liability and property damage associated with the ownership of other corporate assets. In the past, we relied primarily on the operators of our oil and natural gas properties to obtain and maintain liability insurance for our working interest in our oil and natural gas properties. In some cases, we may continue to rely on those operators\u2019 insurance coverage policies depending on the coverage. Since 2011, we have obtained our own insurance policies for our oil and natural gas operations that are broader in scope and coverage and are in our control. We also maintain insurance policies for liabilities associated with and damage to general corporate assets.\nWe would be liable for claims in excess of coverage and for any deductible provided for in the relevant policy. If uncovered liabilities are substantial, payment could adversely impact the Company\u2019s cash on hand, resulting in possible curtailment of operations. Moreover, some liabilities are not insurable at a reasonable cost or at all.\nWe are dependent upon information technology systems, which are subject to disruption, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation and integration.\nWe are dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of our operations. Our information technology systems are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyberattacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity incidents, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to information technology systems and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.\nImprovements in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause our operations depend on the demand for oil and used oil, any improvement in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies (such as wind, solar, geothermal, fuel cells and biofuels) that increase the use of alternative forms of energy and reduce the demand for oil, gas and oil and gas related products could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition due to advances in renewable fuels may lessen the demand for our products and negatively impact our profitability.\nAlternatives to petroleum-based products and production methods are continually under development. For example, a number of automotive, industrial and power generation manufacturers are developing alternative clean power systems using fuel cells or clean-burning gaseous fuels that may address increasing worldwide energy costs, the long-term availability of petroleum reserves and environmental concerns, which if successful could lower the demand for oil and gas. If these non-petroleum-based products and oil alternatives continue to expand and gain broad acceptance such that the overall demand for oil and gas is decreased it could have an adverse effect on our operations and the value of our assets.\nPermitting requirements could delay our ability to start or continue our operations.\nOil and natural gas projects are subject to extensive permitting requirements. Failure to timely obtain required permits to start operations at a project could cause delay and/or the failure of the project resulting in a potential write-off of the investments made.\nNegative public perception regarding us and/or our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nNegative public perception regarding us and/or our industry resulting from, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing, waste disposal, oil spills, seismic activity, climate change, explosions of natural gas transmission lines and the development and operation of pipelines and other midstream facilities may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines and enforcement interpretations. Additionally, environmental groups, landowners, local groups and other advocates may oppose our operations through organized protests, attempts to block or sabotage our operations or those of our midstream transportation providers, intervene in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving our assets or those of our midstream transportation providers, or file lawsuits or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt or delay the development or operation of our assets and business or those of our midstream transportation providers. These actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation. Moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Negative public perception could cause the permits we require to conduct our operations to be withheld, delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business.\nRecently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention towards sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in energy-related activities. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production activities.\nSeasonal weather conditions adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.\nOil and natural gas operations in the Williston Basin and the Gulf Coast can be adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions. In the Williston Basin, drilling and other oil and natural gas activities sometimes cannot be conducted as effectively during the winter months, and this can materially increase our operating and capital costs. Gulf Coast operations are also subject to the risk of adverse weather events, including hurricanes.\nShortages of equipment, services and qualified personnel could reduce our cash flow and adversely affect results of operations.\nThe demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices and activity levels in new regions, causing periodic shortages. These problems can be particularly severe in certain regions such as the Williston Basin and Texas. During periods of high oil and natural gas prices, the demand for drilling rigs and equipment tends to increase along with increased activity levels, and this may result in shortages of equipment. Higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate increased demand for equipment and services and subsequently often result in increased prices for drilling rigs, crews and associated supplies, oilfield equipment and services, and personnel in exploration, production and midstream operations. These types of shortages and subsequent price increases could significantly decrease our profit margin, cash flow and operating results and/or restrict or delay our ability to drill those wells and conduct those activities that we currently have planned and budgeted, causing us to miss our forecasts and projections.\nWe depend significantly upon the continued involvement of our present management.\nWe depend to a significant degree upon the involvement of our management, specifically, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Ryan L. Smith. Our performance and success are dependent to a large extent on the efforts and continued employment of Mr. Smith. We do not believe that Mr. Smith could be quickly replaced with personnel of equal experience and capabilities, and his successor(s) may not be as effective. If Mr. Smith or any of our other key personnel resign or become unable to continue in their present roles and if they are not adequately replaced, our business operations could be adversely affected. The Company entered into an agreement with Mr. Smith on March 5, 2020. The term of Mr. Smith\u2019s Employment Agreement commenced on March 5, 2020, and was to continue until January 1, 2021, provided that on January 1, 2021, the Employment Agreement automatically renewed for one successive term of one year, until January 1, 2022.\nWe have an active Board of Directors that meets several times throughout the year and is intimately involved in our business and the determination of our operational strategies. Members of our Board of Directors work closely with management to identify potential prospects, acquisitions, and areas for further development. If any of our directors resign or become unable to continue in their present role, it may be difficult to find replacements with the same knowledge and experience and as a result, our operations may be adversely affected.\nOur oil and natural gas reserves are estimated and may not reflect the actual volumes of oil and natural gas we will receive, and significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nThe process of estimating accumulations of oil and natural gas is complex and is not exact, due to numerous inherent uncertainties. The process relies on interpretations of available geological, geophysical, engineering, and production data. The extent, quality, and reliability of this technical data can vary. The process also requires certain economic assumptions related to, among other things, oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes, and availability of funds. The accuracy of a reserves estimate is a function of:\n\u25cf the quality and quantity of available data;\n\u25cf the interpretation of that data;\n\u25cf the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate; and\n\u25cf the accuracy of the assumptions.\nThe accuracy of any estimates of proved reserves generally increases with the length of the production history. Due to the limited production history of our properties, the estimates of future production associated with these properties may be subject to greater variance to actual production than would be the case with properties having a longer production history. As our wells produce over time and more data is available, the estimated proved reserves will be re-determined on at least an annual basis and may be adjusted to reflect new information based upon our actual production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors.\nActual future production, oil, and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas most likely will vary from our estimates. It is possible that future production declines in our wells may be greater than we have estimated. Any significant variance to our estimates could materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nWe may purchase oil and natural gas properties with liabilities or risks that we did not know about or that we did not assess correctly, and, as a result, we could be subject to liabilities that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nBefore acquiring oil and natural gas properties, we estimate the reserves, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, potential environmental liabilities, and other factors relating to the properties. However, our review involves many assumptions and estimates, and their accuracy is inherently uncertain. As a result, we may not discover all existing or potential problems associated with the properties we buy. We may not become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and capabilities. We generally do not perform inspections on every well or property, and we may not be able to observe mechanical and environmental problems even when we conduct an inspection. The seller may not be willing or financially able to give us contractual protection against any identified problems, and we may decide to assume environmental and other liabilities in connection with the properties we acquire. If we acquire properties with risks or liabilities we did not know about or that we did not assess correctly, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected as we settle claims and incur cleanup costs related to these liabilities.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Statements\nWe have written down, and may in the future be forced to further write-down, material portions of our assets due to low oil prices.\nThe successful efforts method of accounting is used for oil and gas exploration and production activities. Under this method, all costs for development wells, support equipment and facilities, and proved mineral interests in oil and gas properties are capitalized. We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical cost-carrying value of an asset may no longer be appropriate. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of the asset by estimating the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the asset, including eventual disposition. If the future net undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset\u2019s carrying value and estimated fair value. This impairment does not impact cash flows from operating activities but does reduce earnings and our shareholders\u2019 equity.\nUnder the full cost method of accounting, we capitalize the cost to acquire, explore for and develop our oil and natural gas investments. Under full cost accounting rules, the net capitalized cost of oil and natural gas properties may not exceed a \u201cceiling limit\u201d that is based upon the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves, discounted at 10%, plus the lower of the cost or fair market value of unproved properties. If net capitalized costs exceed the ceiling limit, we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings (a charge referred to as a \u201cceiling test write-down\u201d). The risk of a ceiling test write-down increases when oil and natural gas prices are depressed, if we have substantial downward revisions in estimated proved reserves or if we drill unproductive wells.\nUnder the full cost method, all costs associated with the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties are capitalized and accumulated in a country-wide cost center. This includes any internal costs that are directly related to development and exploration activities, but does not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. Proceeds received from disposals are credited against accumulated cost, except when the sale represents a significant disposal of reserves, in which case a gain or loss is recognized. The sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development and dismantlement costs for each cost center is depleted on the equivalent unit-of-production method, based on proved oil and natural gas reserves. Excluded from amounts subject to depreciation, depletion and amortization are costs associated with unevaluated properties.\nUnder the full cost method, net capitalized costs are limited to the lower of (a) unamortized cost reduced by the related net deferred tax liability and asset retirement obligations, and (b) the cost center ceiling. The cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of (i) estimated future net revenue, discounted at 10% per annum, from proved reserves, based on unescalated costs, adjusted for contract provisions, any financial derivatives qualifying as accounting hedges and asset retirement obligations, and unescalated oil and natural gas prices during the period, (ii) the cost of properties not being amortized, and (iii) the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties included in the cost being amortized, less (iv) income tax effects related to tax assets directly attributable to the natural gas and crude oil properties. If the net book value reduced by the related net deferred income tax liability and asset retirement obligations exceeds the cost center ceiling limitation, a non-cash impairment charge is required in the period in which the impairment occurs.\nWe perform a quarterly ceiling test for our only oil and natural gas cost center, which is the United States. During 2020, our capitalized costs for oil and natural gas properties exceeded the ceiling and, therefore, we recorded an aggregate ceiling test write-down of $2.9 million. The ceiling test incorporates assumptions regarding pricing and discount rates over which we have no influence in the determination of present value. In arriving at the ceiling test for the year ended December 31, 2020, we used an average price applicable to our properties of $39.57 per barrel for oil and $1.99 per Mcfe for natural gas, based on average prices per barrel of oil and per Mcfe of natural gas at the first day of each month of the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, to compute the future cash flows of each of the producing properties at that date.\nCapitalized costs associated with unevaluated properties include exploratory wells in progress, costs for seismic analysis of exploratory drilling locations, and leasehold costs related to unproved properties. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an economic downturn resulting in lower oil prices which required us to incur material write-downs. Unevaluated properties not subject to depreciation, depletion and amortization amounted to an aggregate of approximately $1.6 million as of December 31, 2020. These costs will be transferred to evaluated properties to the extent that we subsequently determine the properties are impaired or if proved reserves are established. During 2020 we impaired $2.1 million of unevaluated properties and reclassified these amounts to the full cost pool.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and our management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective during 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. We cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies do not exist or that they will not occur in the future. If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. We maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting, which is defined as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Based on the results of management\u2019s assessment and evaluation of our internal controls, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2020 due to the material weaknesses described below.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have identified the following material weaknesses:\n\u25cf We had inadequate segregation of duties as a result of limited accounting staff and resources, which may impact our ability to prevent or detect material errors in our consolidated financial statements.\n\u25cf We had inadequate segregation of duties related to logical access to our accounting systems, which may affect our ability to prevent or detect material errors in the recorded transactions.\nAs a result, our management also concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2020, such that the information relating to us required to be disclosed in the reports we file with the SEC (a) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms and (b) is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A control deficiency exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.\nMaintaining effective disclosure controls and procedures and effective internal control over financial reporting are necessary for us to produce reliable financial statements and the Company is committed to remediating its material weaknesses in such controls as promptly as possible. However, there can be no assurance as to when these material weaknesses will be remediated or that additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future. Any failure to remediate the material weaknesses, or the development of new material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, could result in material misstatements in our financial statements and cause us to fail to meet our reporting and financial obligations, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the trading price of our common stock, and/or result in litigation against us or our management. In addition, even if we are successful in strengthening our controls and procedures, those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or facilitate the fair presentation of our financial statements or our periodic reports filed with the SEC.\nThere are inherent limitations in all control systems and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nThe ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require us to identify material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, which is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our management does not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls, even once all material weaknesses and control deficiencies are remediated, will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud in our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving our stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions, such as growth of the Company or increased transaction volume, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may not be detected.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and realize built in losses to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes is subject to limitation.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) and realized built in losses (\u201cRBILS\u201d) to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders (generally 5% stockholders, applying certain look-through rules) increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders\u2019 lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years).\nOn December 27, 2017, we paid down debt under our credit facility with APEG II with shares of our common stock, which represented a 49.3% ownership change in the Company. As a result, our ability to use these NOLs and RBILS were significantly reduced.\nRisks Related to Governmental Regulations\nOil and natural gas operations are subject to environmental, legislative and regulatory initiatives that can materially adversely affect the timing and cost of operations and the demand for crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs.\nOur operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and safety, the environment and natural resources. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways including, but not limited to the following:\n\u25cf requiring the installation of pollution-control equipment or otherwise restricting the handling or disposal of wastes and other substances associated with operations;\n\u25cf limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas, such as wetlands, coastal regions or areas that contain endangered or threatened species and/or species of special statewide concern or their habitats;\n\u25cf requiring investigatory and remedial actions to address pollution caused by our operations or attributable to former operations;\n\u25cf requiring noise, lighting, visual impact, odor and/or dust mitigation, setbacks, landscaping, fencing, and other measures;\n\u25cf restricting access to certain equipment or areas to a limited set of employees or contractors who have proper certification or permits to conduct work (e.g., confined space entry and process safety maintenance requirements); and\n\u25cf restricting or even prohibiting water use based upon availability, impacts or other factors.\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial or restoration obligations, and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or wastes have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, local restrictions, such as state or local moratoria, city ordinances, zoning laws and traffic regulations, may restrict or prohibit the execution of operational plans. In addition, third parties, such as neighboring landowners, may file claims alleging property damage, nuisance or personal injury arising from our operations or from the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment.\nThe trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. We monitor developments at the federal, state and local levels to keep informed of actions pertaining to future regulatory requirements that might be imposed in order to mitigate the costs of compliance with any such requirements. We also monitor industry groups that help formulate recommendations for addressing existing or future regulations and that share best practices and lessons learned in relation to pollution prevention and incident investigations.\nSee \u201cEnvironmental Laws and Regulations\u201d in Item 1 - Business in this Form 10-K for a discussion of the major environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that relate to our business. We believe, but cannot be certain, that we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations. We cannot reasonably predict what applicable laws, regulations or guidance may eventually be adopted with respect to our operations or the ultimate cost to comply with such requirements.\nProposed changes to U.S. tax laws, if adopted, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nFrom time to time, legislative proposals are made that would, if enacted, result in the elimination of the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs, the elimination of the deduction from income for domestic production activities relating to oil and gas exploration and development, the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, and an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. Such changes, if adopted, or other similar changes that reduce or eliminate deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur ability to produce crude oil, natural gas, and associated liquids economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations and/or completions or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use at a reasonable cost and in accordance with applicable environmental rules.\nThe hydraulic fracturing process on which we and others in our industry depend to complete wells that will produce commercial quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs requires the use and disposal or recycling of significant quantities of water. Our inability to secure sufficient amounts of water, or to dispose of, or recycle the water used in our operations, could adversely impact our operations. Moreover, the imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of wastes, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids, and other wastes associated with the exploration, development, or production of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs.\nCompliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage, and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions, or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nWe currently have an unlimited number of shares of common stock authorized and there may be future issuances of sales of our common stock, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and dilute a shareholder\u2019s ownership of common stock.\nThe exercise of (a) any options granted to executive officers and other employees under our equity compensation plans and (b) of any warrants and other issuances of our common stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of the shares of our common stock. Additionally, other than restrictions under our February 2021 underwriting agreement, we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive shares of common stock, and currently have an unlimited number of authorized shares of common stock, provided that we are subject to the requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d)(which generally requires shareholder approval for any transactions which would result in the issuance of more than 20% of our then outstanding shares of common stock or voting rights representing over 20% of our then outstanding shares of stock). Issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock and/or sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such issuances or sales might occur could materially adversely affect the market price of the shares of our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in the future, including in connection with any future offering, will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of our future issuances or offerings. Accordingly, our stockholders bear the risk that our future issuances and/or offerings will reduce the market price of our common stock and dilute their stock holdings in us.\nWe have established preferred stock which can be designated by the Board of Directors without shareholder approval.\nWe have 100,000 shares of preferred stock authorized, which includes 50,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (none of which are outstanding) and 50,000 shares of Series P preferred stock (none of which are outstanding). Shares of preferred stock may be designated and issued by our Board of Directors without shareholder approval with voting powers, and such preferences and relative, participating, optional, or other special rights and powers as determined by our Board of Directors, which may be greater than the shares of common stock currently outstanding. As a result, shares of preferred stock may be issued by our Board of Directors which cause the holders to have voting power over our shares or provide the holders of the preferred stock the right to convert the shares of preferred stock they hold into shares of our common stock, which may cause substantial dilution to our then common stock stockholders and/or have other rights and preferences (including, but not limited to voting rights) greater than those of our common stock stockholders. Investors should keep in mind that the Board of Directors has the authority to issue additional shares of preferred stock, which could cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders or result in a change of control. Because our Board of Directors is entitled to designate the powers and preferences of the preferred stock without a vote of our stockholders, subject to NASDAQ rules and regulations, our stockholders will have no control over what designations and preferences our future preferred stock, if any, will have.\nOur governing documents and Wyoming law includes various take-over defense provisions that could discourage some advantageous transactions.\nWe are subject to a number of provisions of the Wyoming Management Stability Act, an anti-takeover statute, and have a classified or \u201cstaggered\u201d board. We could implement additional anti-takeover defenses in the future. These existing or future defenses could prevent or discourage a potential transaction in which shareholders would receive a takeover price in excess of then-current market values, even if a majority of the shareholders support such a transaction.\nOur stock price has historically been and is likely to continue to be, volatile.\nOur stock is traded on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol \u201cUSEG\u201d. During the last 52 weeks, our common stock has traded as high as $18.57 per share and as low as $2.44 per share. We expect our common stock will continue to be subject to wide fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors, including factors beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u25cf price volatility in the oil and natural gas commodities markets;\n\u25cf variations in our drilling, recompletion and operating activity;\n\u25cf relatively small amounts of our common stock trading on any given day;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf legislative and regulatory changes; and\n\u25cf changes in the national and global economic outlook.\nThe stock market has recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, and oil and natural gas prices have declined significantly. These fluctuations have particularly affected the market prices of securities of oil and natural gas companies like ours.\nOur Common Stock may be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market if we cannot satisfy Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements.\nAmong the conditions required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, Nasdaq requires us to maintain at least $2.5 million in stockholders\u2019 equity or $500,000 in net income over the prior two years or two of the prior three years, to have a majority of independent directors, and to maintain a stock price over $1.00 per share. Our stockholders\u2019 equity may not remain above Nasdaq\u2019s $2.5 million minimum, we may not generate over $500,000 of yearly net income moving forward, we may not be able to maintain independent directors, and we may not be able to maintain a stock price over $1.00 per share. Delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market could make trading our common stock more difficult for investors, potentially leading to declines in our share price and liquidity. Without a Nasdaq Capital Market listing, stockholders may have a difficult time getting a quote for the sale or purchase of our stock, the sale or purchase of our stock would likely be made more difficult and the trading volume and liquidity of our stock could decline. Delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market could also result in negative publicity and could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital. The absence of such a listing may adversely affect the acceptance of our common stock as currency or the value accorded by other parties. Further, if we are delisted, we would also incur additional costs under state blue sky laws in connection with any sales of our securities. These requirements could severely limit the market liquidity of our common stock and the ability of our stockholders to sell our common stock in the secondary market. If our common stock is delisted by Nasdaq, our common stock may be eligible to trade on an over-the-counter quotation system, such as the OTCQB market, where an investor may find it more difficult to sell our stock or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock. In the event our common stock is delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market, we may not be able to list our common stock on another national securities exchange or obtain quotation on an over-the counter quotation system.\nIf we are delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market, your ability to sell your shares of our common stock could also be limited by the penny stock restrictions, which could further limit the marketability of your shares.\nIf our common stock is delisted, it could come within the definition of \u201cpenny stock\u201d as defined in the Exchange Act and would then be covered by Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act. That Rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale. Consequently, Rule 15g-9, if it were to become applicable, would affect the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to sell our securities, and accordingly would affect the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the public market. These additional procedures could also limit our ability to raise additional capital in the future.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nBecause we are a small company, the requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nAs a public company with listed equity securities, we must comply with the federal securities laws, rules and regulations, including certain corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) and the Dodd-Frank Act, related rules and regulations of the SEC and NASDAQ, with which a private company is not required to comply. Complying with these laws, rules and regulations will occupy a significant amount of time of our board of directors and management and will significantly increase our costs and expenses, which we cannot estimate accurately at this time. Among other things, we must:\n\u25cf establish and maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;\n\u25cf comply with rules and regulations promulgated by NASDAQ;\n\u25cf prepare and distribute periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws;\n\u25cf maintain various internal compliance and disclosures policies, such as those relating to disclosure controls and procedures and insider trading in our common stock;\n\u25cf involve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the above activities;\n\u25cf maintain a comprehensive internal audit function; and\n\u25cf maintain an investor relations function.\nIn addition, being a public company subject to these rules and regulations may require us to accept less director and officer liability insurance coverage than we desire or to incur substantial costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee, and qualified executive officers.\nOur business could be adversely affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats.\nWe face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information or to render our information or systems unusable, and threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third-party facilities and infrastructure, such as gathering and processing facilities, refineries, rail facilities and pipelines. The potential for such security threats subjects our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, unauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to data corruption, communication interruptions, or other disruptions to our operations.\nOur implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate such security threats and to increase security for our information, systems, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. If any of these security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of, or damage to, sensitive information or facilities, infrastructure and systems essential to our business and operations, as well as data corruption, reputational damage, communication interruptions or other disruptions to our operations, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nThe threat and impact of terrorist attacks, cyber-attacks or similar hostilities may adversely impact our operations.\nWe cannot assess the extent of either the threat or the potential impact of future terrorist attacks on the energy industry in general, and on us in particular, either in the short-term or in the long-term. Uncertainty surrounding such hostilities may affect our operations in unpredictable ways, including the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including pipelines and gathering systems, production facilities, processing plants and refineries, could be targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror, a cyber-attack or electronic security breach, or an act of war.\nWe may have difficulty managing growth in our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to execute our business plan in a timely fashion.\nBecause of our small size, growth in accordance with our business plans, if achieved, will place a significant strain on our financial, technical, operational and management resources. As we expand our activities, including our planned increase in oil exploration, development and production, and increase the number of projects we are evaluating or in which we participate, there will be additional demands on our financial, technical and management resources. The failure to continue to upgrade our technical, administrative, operating and financial control systems or the occurrence of unexpected expansion difficulties, including the inability to recruit and retain experienced managers, geoscientists, petroleum engineers and landmen could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to execute our business plan in a timely fashion.\nFailure to adequately protect critical data and technology systems could materially affect our operations.\nInformation technology solution failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding processing of transactions and reporting financial results, resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer, employee or our information, or damage to our reputation. There can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIf we complete acquisitions or enter into business combinations in the future, they may disrupt or have a negative impact on our business.\nIf we complete acquisitions or enter into business combinations in the future, funding permitting, we could have difficulty integrating the acquired companies\u2019 assets, personnel and operations with our own. Additionally, acquisitions, mergers or business combinations we may enter into in the future could result in a change of control of the Company, and a change in the board of directors or officers of the Company. In addition, the key personnel of the acquired business may not be willing to work for us. We cannot predict the effect expansion may have on our core business. Regardless of whether we are successful in making an acquisition or completing a business combination, the negotiations could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees and increase our expenses. In addition to the risks described above, acquisitions and business combinations are accompanied by a number of inherent risks, including, without limitation, the following:\n\u25cf the difficulty of integrating acquired companies, concepts and operations;\n\u25cf the potential disruption of the ongoing businesses and distraction of our management and the management of acquired companies;\n\u25cf change in our business focus and/or management;\n\u25cf difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u25cf the potential impairment of relationships with employees and partners as a result of any integration of new management personnel;\n\u25cf the potential inability to manage an increased number of locations and employees;\n\u25cf our ability to successfully manage the companies and/or concepts acquired;\n\u25cf the failure to realize efficiencies, synergies and cost savings; or\n\u25cf the effect of any government regulations which relate to the business acquired.\nOur business could be severely impaired if and to the extent that we are unable to succeed in addressing any of these risks or other problems encountered in connection with an acquisition or business combination, many of which cannot be presently identified. These risks and problems could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAny acquisition or business combination transaction we enter into in the future could cause substantial dilution to existing stockholders, result in one party having majority or significant control over the Company or result in a change in business focus of the Company.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Investors should not rely on an investment in us if they require income generated from dividends paid on our capital stock. Because we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, any income derived from our common stock would only come from a rise in the market price of our common stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable.\nIf persons engage in short sales of our common stock, including sales of shares to be issued upon exercise of our outstanding warrants, the price of our common stock may decline.\nSelling short is a technique used by a stockholder to take advantage of an anticipated decline in the price of a security. In addition, holders of options and warrants will sometimes sell short knowing they can, in effect, cover through the exercise of an option or warrant, thus locking in a profit. A significant number of short sales or a large volume of other sales within a relatively short period of time can create downward pressure on the market price of a security. Further sales of common stock issued upon exercise of our outstanding warrants could cause even greater declines in the price of our common stock due to the number of additional shares available in the market upon such exercise, which could encourage short sales that could further undermine the value of our common stock. Stockholders could, therefore, experience a decline in the values of their investment as a result of short sales of our common stock.\nStockholders may be diluted significantly through our efforts to obtain financing and satisfy obligations through the issuance of securities.\nWherever possible, our Board of Directors will attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy obligations. In many instances, we believe that the non-cash consideration will consist of shares of our common stock, preferred stock, or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. Our Board of Directors has authority, without action or vote of the stockholders, subject to the requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market (which generally require shareholder approval for any transactions which would result in the issuance of more than 20% of our then outstanding shares of common stock or voting rights representing over 20% of our then outstanding shares of stock, subject to certain exceptions, including sales in a public offering and/or sales which are undertaken at or above the lower of the closing price immediately preceding the signing of the binding agreement or the average closing price for the five trading days preceding the signing of the binding agreement), to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock, preferred stock or warrants to purchase such shares of common stock. In addition, we may attempt to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock, possibly at a discount to market in the future. These actions will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing stockholders and may further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. Such issuances may also serve to enhance existing management\u2019s ability to maintain control of us, because the shares may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management.\nFuture litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences, including judgments or settlements.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries and may be involved in governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business. Many of these matters raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties and complexities. The timing of the final resolutions to these types of matters is often uncertain. Additionally, the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements, either of which could require substantial payments, adversely affecting our results of operations and liquidity.", "PERMNO": 79039, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "USEG"}
