{"cik": "230557", "company": "SELECTIVE INSURANCE GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAny of the following risk factors could: (i) significantly impact our business, liquidity, capital resources, results of operations, financial condition, and debt ratings; and (ii) cause our actual results to differ materially from historical or anticipated results. These non-exhaustive risk factors might affect, alter, or change our actions executing our long-term capital strategy, including, but not limited to, contributing capital to any or all of the Insurance Subsidiaries, issuing additional debt and/or equity securities, repurchasing our equity securities, redeeming our fixed income securities, or increasing or decreasing stockholders\u2019 dividends.\nRisks Related to our Insurance Operations\nWe are subject to losses from catastrophic events.\nOur results are subject to losses from natural and man-made catastrophes, including, but not limited to: hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, terrorism, including cyber-attacks, explosions, severe winter weather, floods, and fires, some of which may be related to climate changes. The frequency and severity of these catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. One year may be relatively free of such events while another may have multiple events. In recent years, we have seen an escalation in global insured industry losses from catastrophes, with 2017 being the most costly year on record and 2018 being the third most costly year on record, as reported by various statistical reporting agencies. Whether this is a short-term phenomenon, or is part of a longer-term trend driven by climate change, other environmental factors, and development in areas more exposed to catastrophes, is subject to debate. For further discussion regarding man-made catastrophes that relate to terrorism, see the risk factor directly below regarding the potential for significant losses from acts of terrorism.\nThere is widespread interest among scientists, legislators, regulators, and the public regarding the effect that greenhouse gas emissions may have on our environment, including climate change. If greenhouse gasses continue to impact our climate, it is possible that more devastating catastrophic events could occur.\nThe magnitude of catastrophe losses is determined by the severity of the event and the total amount of insured exposures in the area affected by the event as determined by ISO's Property Claim Services unit. Most of the risks underwritten by our insurance operations are concentrated geographically in the Eastern and Midwestern regions of the country. Hurricanes continue to be our most significant catastrophic exposure, particularly in the Eastern states. However, tornadic activity in the Midwestern regions of the U.S. could also adversely impact our financial results. It also is possible that we could experience more than one severe catastrophic event in any given period.\nCertain factors can impact our estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes. Such factors can include inability to access portions of the impacted areas following a catastrophic event, scarcity of necessary labor and materials that delay repairs and increase our loss costs, regulatory uncertainties, including new interpretations of coverage, residual market assessment-related increases in our catastrophe losses, late claims reporting, and escalation of business interruption costs due to infrastructure disruption. The occurrence of a catastrophe close to the end of a reporting period also may limit the availability of information for estimating loss and loss expense reserves and it is possible that more detailed information about claims may be available later resulting in changes in reserves in subsequent periods.\nAlthough catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of property and casualty insurance lines, most of our historical catastrophe-related claims have been from commercial property and homeowners coverages. In an effort to limit our exposure to catastrophe losses, we purchase catastrophe reinsurance. Catastrophe reinsurance could prove inadequate if: (i) the various modeling software programs that we use to analyze the Insurance Subsidiaries\u2019 risk result in an inadequate purchase of reinsurance by us; (ii) a major catastrophe loss exceeds the reinsurance limit or the reinsurers\u2019 financial capacity; or (iii) the frequency of catastrophe losses results in our Insurance Subsidiaries exceeding the aggregate limits provided by the catastrophe reinsurance treaty. Even after considering our reinsurance protection, our exposure to catastrophe risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nOur loss and loss expense reserves may not be adequate to cover actual losses and expenses.\nWe must maintain loss and loss expense reserves for our estimated liability for loss and loss expense associated with reported and unreported insurance claims. Our estimates of reserve amounts are based on known facts and circumstances, including our expectations of the ultimate settlement and claim administration expenses, trends in claims severity and frequency, including the impact of inflationary trends on medical costs, predictions of future events, and other subjective factors relating to our insurance policies in force. There is no method for precisely estimating the ultimate liability for settlement of claims. Estimates of reserve amounts may be further impacted by unexpected increases in loss costs related to economic or social inflation, developments in tort law, and various state legislative initiatives, including expansion of statutes of limitations and\nrevisions to claims settlement practices standards. For example, several states in our principal operating areas are exploring expansion of the statute of limitations for previously time-barred civil suits alleging sexual abuse of a minor. This type of retroactive legislation may significantly increase insurance industry loss costs and require re-evaluation of previously established reserves. In addition, state initiatives such as legalization of marijuana may have significant impact on future loss development, as usage of this drug becomes more pervasive. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the reserves we establish are adequate or will be adequate in the future. From time-to-time, we increase reserves if they are inadequate or reduce them if they are redundant. An increase in reserves: (i) reduces net income and stockholders\u2019 equity for the period in which the reserves are increased; and (ii) could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nWe are subject to potentially significant losses from acts of terrorism.\nAs a Standard Commercial Lines and E&S Lines writer, we are required to participate in TRIPRA, which was extended by Congress to December 31, 2020. TRIPRA rescinded all previously approved coverage exclusions for terrorism and requires private insurers and the U.S. government to share the risk of loss on future acts of terrorism certified by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. Under TRIPRA, each participating insurer is responsible for paying a deductible of specified losses before federal assistance is available. This deductible is based on a percentage of the prior year\u2019s applicable Standard Commercial Lines and E&S Lines premiums. In 2019, our deductible is $339 million. For losses above the deductible, the federal government will pay 81% of losses to an industry limit of $100 billion, and the insurer retains 19%. The federal share of losses will be reduced by 1% to 80% in 2020. Although TRIPRA\u2019s provisions mitigate our loss exposure to a large-scale terrorist attack, our deductible is substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings. Additionally, if the U.S. Secretary of Treasury does not certify certain future terrorist events, it is possible we could be required to pay terrorism-related covered losses without TRIPRA's risk-sharing benefits. For example, the U.S. Secretary of Treasury did not certify either the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing or the 2015 San Bernardino, California shootings as terrorism events.\nUnder TRIPRA, terrorism coverage is mandatory for all primary workers compensation policies. Additionally, insureds with non-workers compensation commercial policies have the option to accept or decline our terrorism coverage or negotiate with us for other terms. In 2018, 89% of our Standard Commercial Lines non-workers compensation policyholders purchased terrorism coverage that included nuclear, biological, chemical, and radioactive (\"NBCR\") events.\nMany of the states in which we write commercial property insurance mandate that we cover fire following an act of terrorism, regardless of whether the insured specifically purchased terrorism coverage. Also, in addition to providing terrorism coverage for lines of business required and covered by TRIPRA, we sometimes choose to provide terrorism coverage for lines of business not included in TRIPRA, such as Commercial Automobile. Personal lines of business have never been covered under TRIPRA. Homeowners policies within our Standard Personal Lines exclude nuclear losses, but do not exclude biological or chemical losses.\nIf future legislation changes or eliminates TRIPRA, our exposure to terrorism losses could increase materially. If that happens, the measures we might take to mitigate our risk could impact our ability to write future business, or increase our reinsurance expense. We currently plan to continue providing coverage to our customers that includes protection from terrorism events, without the benefit of a conditional exclusion that would specifically exclude this coverage if TRIPRA was non-renewed. Therefore, in the event that TRIPRA is changed or eliminated, our exposure to losses from terrorism events will increase materially, which would have the potential to significantly negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. Our current reinsurance programs generally provide coverage for conventional acts of foreign and domestic terrorism, but no coverage is afforded to NBCR events.\nOur ability to reduce our risk exposure depends on the availability and cost of reinsurance.\nWe transfer a portion of our underwriting risk exposure to reinsurance companies. Through our reinsurance arrangements, a specified portion of our loss and loss expense is assumed by the reinsurer in exchange for a specified portion of premiums. The availability, amount, and cost of reinsurance depend on market conditions, which may fluctuate significantly, and do not necessarily correlate to our specific book of business experience. Most of our reinsurance contracts renew annually and may be impacted by the market conditions at the time of the renewal. Any decrease in the amount of our reinsurance will increase our risk of loss. Any increase in the cost of reinsurance that cannot be passed on to our policyholders will reduce our earnings. If we are unable to obtain reinsurance in amounts that we expected or on acceptable terms, our ability to write future business could be adversely affected, our reinsurance expenses could increase, or we might assume more risk for losses on aggregate or individual losses than we currently do.\nWe are exposed to credit risk.\nWe are exposed to credit risk in several areas of our insurance operations, including from:\n\u2022\nOur reinsurers, who are obligated to us under our reinsurance agreements. During periods of high catastrophe loss activity, amounts recoverable from our reinsurers and the correlated credit risk can increase quickly and significantly, fluctuating over time. Our reinsurers also often rely on their own reinsurance programs, or retrocessions, to manage their exposure to large losses. Any limitations on or the inability of our reinsurers to collect on their retrocession programs, or reinstate coverage after a large loss, particularly given the relatively small size of the global reinsurer community, may impair their ability to pay our reinsurance claims. Accordingly, we have direct and indirect counterparty credit risk from our reinsurers. We attempt to mitigate our direct and indirect counterparty credit risk from our reinsurers by: (i) pursuing relationships with reinsurers rated \u201cA-\u201d or higher by A.M. Best; and/or (ii) obtaining collateral to secure reinsurance obligations.\n\u2022\nCertain life insurance companies if they fail to fulfill their obligations to those customers for whom we have purchased annuities under structured settlement agreements.\n\u2022\nSome of our distribution partners, who collect premiums due us from our customers.\n\u2022\nSome of our customers, who are responsible for payment of premiums and/or deductibles directly to us.\n\u2022\nThe invested assets in our defined benefit plan, which partially fund our liability associated with this plan. To the extent that credit risk adversely impacts the valuation and performance of the invested assets in our defined benefit plan, the funded status of the defined benefit plan could be adversely impacted and, if so, the expense of the plan and our obligations under it could increase.\nOur exposure to credit risk could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nDifficult conditions in global capital markets and the economy may adversely affect our revenue and profitability and harm our business, and these conditions may not improve in the near future.\nGeneral economic conditions in the U.S. and throughout the world and volatility in financial and insurance markets may materially affect our results of operations. Factors such as business and consumer confidence, unemployment levels, consumer spending, business investment, government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and, indirectly, the amount and profitability of our business. During 2018, 32% of DPW in our Standard Commercial Lines business was based on payroll/sales of our underlying customers. An economic downturn in which our customers experience declines in revenue or employee count could adversely affect our audit and endorsement premium in our Standard Commercial Lines.\nUnfavorable economic developments could adversely affect our earnings if our customers have less need for insurance coverage, cancel existing insurance policies, modify coverage, or choose not to renew with us. Challenging economic conditions may impair the ability of our customers to pay premiums as they come due. Adverse economic conditions may have a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nA downgrade or a potential downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could result in a loss of business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAny significant downgrade in our financial strength ratings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings. For additional information on our current financial strength ratings, refer to \"Overview\" in Item 1. \"Business.\" of this Form 10-K.\nA significant financial strength rating downgrade, particularly from A.M. Best, would affect our ability to write new or renewal business with customers, some of whom are required under various third party agreements to maintain insurance with a carrier with a specified minimum rating. Our $30 million line of credit (\"Line of Credit\") requires our Insurance Subsidiaries to maintain an A.M. Best rating of at least \u201cA-\u201d (one level below our current rating), so a downgrade could create a default leading to an acceleration of any outstanding principal. Such an event also could trigger default provisions under certain of our other debt instruments and negatively impact our ability to borrow in the future.\nNationally recognized statistical rating organizations (\"NRSROs\") also rate our long-term debt creditworthiness. Credit ratings indicate the ability of debt issuers to meet obligations in a timely manner and are important factors in our overall funding profile and ability to access certain types of liquidity. Our current senior credit ratings are as follows:\nDowngrades in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in many ways, including making it more expensive for us to access capital markets. We cannot predict the possible rating actions NRSROs might take that could adversely affect our business or our potential actions in response.\nWe have many competitors and potential competitors.\nDemand for insurance is influenced by prevailing general economic conditions. The supply of insurance is related to prevailing prices, insured loss levels, and industry capital levels that may fluctuate in response to changing rates of return on insurance industry investments. Pricing also is influenced by the operating performance of insurers, who may increase pricing to meet return on equity objectives. Consequently, the insurance industry historically has had cycles characterized by periods of intense price competition from excess underwriting capacity and periods of favorable pricing driven by shortages of underwriting capacity and poor insurer operating performance. If competitors price business below technical levels, we might decide it is appropriate to reduce our profit margin to retain our best business.\nWe compete with regional, national, and direct-writer property and casualty insurance companies for customers, distribution partners, and employees. Some competitors are public stock companies, some are mutual companies, and some are reciprocal insurers. Many competitors are larger and may have lower operating costs, lower cost of capital, or the ability to absorb greater risk while maintaining their financial strength ratings. Other competitors, such as mutual or reciprocal companies, are cooperatively owned by insureds and do not have shareholders who evaluate return on equity performance. Consequently, some competitors may be able to price their products more competitively. These competitive pressures could result in increased pricing pressures on a number of our products and services, particularly as competitors seek to win market share, and may limit our ability to maintain or increase our profitability. Because of its relatively low cost of entry, the Internet has emerged as a significant competitive new marketplace where existing and new competitors have platforms. Established insurance competitors, such as Chubb Limited and The Progressive Corporation, are beginning to explore broader offerings through this digital platform, while new insurance competitors continue to emerge, including, but are not limited to, Lemonade and Attune. Reinsurers also have entered certain primary property and casualty insurance markets to diversify their operations and compete with us. Because the Internet makes it easier to bundle products and services, it also is possible that companies doing business on the Internet could enter the insurance business in the future or form strategic alliances with insurers. Changes in competitors and competition, particularly on the Internet, could cause changes in the supply or demand for insurance and adversely affect our business.\nWe have less loss experience data than our larger competitors.\nInsurers rely on access to reliable data about their customers and loss experience to build complex analytics and predictive models that assess risk profitability, adverse claim development potential, recovery opportunities, fraudulent activities, and customer buying habits. We expect the use of data science and analytics will continue to increase and become more complex and accurate, particularly with the use of larger amounts of relevant data. Some of our competitors, particularly larger national carriers, have significantly larger volumes of data about the performance of the risks they have underwritten. It is possible that the loss experience from our insurance operations, particularly the more limited experience data we have related to our E&S business acquired in 2011, may not be sufficiently large or granular in all circumstances to analyze and project our future costs as accurately as our larger competitors. To supplement our data, we use industry loss experience data from ISO, AAIS, and NCCI. While relevant, industry data may not correlate specifically to the performance of risks we have underwritten and may not be as predictive as if we had more data on our book of business. Because we use and rely on the aggregated industry loss data assembled by ISO, AAIS, NCCI and other similar rating bureaus under the anti-trust exemptions of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, we likely would be at a competitive disadvantage to larger insurers with more loss experience data on their book of business if Congress repealed the McCarran-Ferguson Act.\nWe depend on distribution partners.\nWe market and sell our insurance products through independent distribution partners who are not our employees. We believe that these independent partners will remain a significant force in overall insurance industry premium production because they provide insurance and risk management expertise and advice to customers, particularly small businesses and individuals, who otherwise do not have it or cannot afford either the time or expense to acquire it. We also believe that some commercial customers, particularly smaller commercial businesses, will continue to use independent distribution partners for the potential customer and business referrals independent distribution partners may provide. Independent distribution partners also generally provide customers with a wider choice of insurance products than those who represent or are employed by only one insurer. Our reliance on independent distribution partners, however, present challenges and risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nThe availability of products from multiple markets creates competition in our distribution channel and we must market our products and services to our distribution partners before they sell them to our mutual customers.\n\u2022\nGrowth in our market share is dependent, in part, on growth in the market share controlled by our distribution partners. Independent retail insurance agencies control 84% of Standard Commercial Lines business but only 35% of Standard Personal Lines business in the U.S. Consequently, our Standard Personal Lines market opportunity could be more limited. Over the last several years, more competitors are focused on lower cost \"direct to customer\" distribution models based on technological developments and efficiencies. Continued advancements in \"direct to customer\" distribution models may impact the overall market share controlled by our distribution partners and make it more difficult for us to grow or require us to establish relationships with more distribution partners.\n\u2022\nThere has been an increasing trend of consolidation among our independent distribution partners, particularly by private-equity-backed entities and publicly-traded insurance brokers (\"aggregators\"). As more of our independent distribution partners consolidate and become larger, their influence on our business and premium production can increase. For example, they could direct the business they produce to be consolidated with a smaller group of insurance carriers, which may or may not include us. With their increased size and control of meaningful amounts of business, they could also increase insurance carrier costs through requiring higher base and supplemental commissions to place business. Aggregators accounted for approximately 28% of our DPW at December 31, 2018. Currently, no one distribution partner is responsible for 10% or more of our combined insurance operations' premium.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are tied to the successful marketing and sales efforts of our products by our independent distribution partners. In addition, under insurance laws and regulations and common law, we may have liability for the business practices of, or actions taken by, our independent distribution partners.\nExpansion of our insurance offerings and geographic footprint may create additional risks\nPart of our growth strategy includes measured geographic and product expansion. In 2017, we established a Southwest Region and began writing Standard Commercial Lines in Arizona. In 2018, we expanded our Standard Commercial Lines operations into Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah and, later in the year, began offering Standard Personal Lines products in Arizona and Utah. In our Northeast Region, we also expanded our Standard Commercial Lines business into New Hampshire in 2017. We expect to continue to diversify our book of business through geographic and product expansion. Although diversification of our business is beneficial to our competitive position and long-term results, it exposes us to increased and different risks, including catastrophic natural risks to which we previously only had limited exposure due to our narrower geographic footprint and risks related to insurance regulations in the expansion states. These new risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nWe are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability, increase our capital requirements, and/or limit our growth.\nOur Insurance Subsidiaries are heavily regulated by extensive insurance laws and regulations that can change on short notice. At any given time, there may be various legislative and regulatory proposals in each of the 50 states and District of Columbia that, if enacted, may affect our Insurance Subsidiaries. The primary public policy behind insurance regulation is the protection of policyholders and claimants against insurer insolvency and inappropriate business practices. Insurance regulation typically prioritizes policyholder and claimant protection over all other constituencies, including shareholders. By virtue of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, our Insurance Subsidiaries are primarily regulated by the states in which they are domiciled and licensed. State insurance regulation is generally uniform throughout the U.S. because most states have enacted variations of model laws and regulations that permit their insurance department to be accredited by the NAIC and have their regulatory examinations and other work be given full faith and credit by other state regulators. Despite their general similarity, state insurance laws and regulations do vary by jurisdiction. The types of insurance activities regulated by the states include:\n\u2022\nPricing and underwriting practices;\n\u2022\nClaims practices;\n\u2022\nExiting geographic markets and/or canceling or non-renewing policies;\n\u2022\nAssessments for guaranty funds and second-injury funds and other mandatory assigned risks and reinsurance;\n\u2022\nThe types, quality, and concentration of investments we make;\n\u2022\nDividends from our Insurance Subsidiaries to the Parent; and\n\u2022\nThe acquisition of 10% or more of the stock of a company such as Selective, which is an insurance holding company that owns insurance subsidiaries.\nThe broad regulatory, administrative, and supervisory powers of the various state departments of insurance include the following:\n\u2022\nRelated to our financial condition, review and approval of such matters as minimum capital and surplus requirements, standards of solvency, security deposits, methods of accounting, form and content of statutory financial statements, reserves for unpaid loss and loss expenses, reinsurance, payment of dividends and other distributions to shareholders, periodic financial examinations, and annual and other report filings.\n\u2022\nRelated to our general business, review and approval of such matters as certificates of authority and other insurance company licenses, licensing and compensation of distribution partners, premium rates (which may not be excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory), policy forms, policy terminations, reporting of statistical information regarding our premiums and losses, periodic market conduct examinations, unfair trade practices, participation in mandatory shared market mechanisms, such as assigned risk pools and reinsurance pools, participation in mandatory state guaranty funds, and mandated continuing workers compensation coverage post-termination of employment.\n\u2022\nRelated to our ownership of the Insurance Subsidiaries, we are required to register as an insurance holding company system in each state where an insurance subsidiary is domiciled and report information concerning all of our operations that may materially affect the operations, management, or financial condition of the insurers. As an insurance holding company, the appropriate state regulatory authority may: (i) examine our Insurance Subsidiaries or us at any time; (ii) require disclosure or prior approval of material transactions of any of the Insurance Subsidiaries with its affiliates; and (iii) require prior approval or notice of certain transactions, such as payment of dividends or distributions to us.\nAlthough Congress has largely delegated insurance regulation to the various states by virtue of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, we also are subject to federal legislation and administrative policies related our insurance business, including TRIPRA, OFAC, various privacy laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Drivers Privacy Protection Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and the policies of the Federal Trade Commission. By issuing workers compensation policies, we are subject to Mandatory Medicare Secondary Payer Reporting under the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007. As a publicly traded company, we also are subject to Federal securities laws, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act. If Congress were to enact laws affecting the oversight of insurer solvency and state regulators remained responsible for rate approval, it is possible that we could be subject to a conflicting and inconsistent regulatory framework that could impact our profitability and capital adequacy.\nThe European Union enacted Solvency II, which was implemented in 2016 and sets out new requirements for capital adequacy and risk management for insurers operating in Europe. The strengthened regime is intended to reduce the possibility of consumer loss or market disruption in insurance. In 2014, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors proposed Basic Capital Standards for Global Systemically Important Insurers as well as a uniform capital framework for internationally\nactive insurers. Although Solvency II does not govern domestic American insurers, and we do not have international operations, we believe that development of global capital standards will influence the development of similar standards by domestic regulators. The NAIC requires insurers to maintain a framework for identifying, assessing, monitoring, managing, and reporting on the \u201cmaterial and relevant risks\u201d associated with the insurer's (or insurance group's) current and future business plans. ORSA requires companies to file an internal assessment of their solvency with insurance regulators annually. Although no specific capital adequacy standard currently is articulated in ORSA, it is possible that such a standard could be developed over time that might increase minimum capital requirements for insurers and adversely impact our growth and return on equity.\nWe are subject to non-governmental regulators, such as the NASDAQ Stock Market and the New York Stock Exchange where we list our securities. To some degree, these regulators can overlap each other and have different interpretations and/or regulations on the same legal issues. Consequently, we have the risk that one regulator\u2019s position or interpretation may conflict with that of another regulator on the same issue and that they may change over time.\nWe believe we are in compliance with all laws and regulations that have a material effect on our results of operations, but the cost of complying with various, potentially conflicting laws and regulations, and changes in those laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nClass action litigation could affect our business practices and financial results.\nClass action litigation has been filed from time-to-time against our industry, related to the following issues:\n\u2022\nUrban homeowner insurance underwriting practices, including those related to architectural or structural features and attempts by federal regulators to expand the Federal Housing Administration's guidelines to determine unfair discrimination;\n\u2022\nCredit scoring and predictive modeling pricing;\n\u2022\nCybersecurity breaches;\n\u2022\nInvestment disclosure;\n\u2022\nManaged care practices;\n\u2022\nPrompt and appropriate payment of personal injury protection claims;\n\u2022\nDirect repair shop utilization practices;\n\u2022\nThe use of after-market replacement parts;\n\u2022\nFlood insurance claim practices; and\n\u2022\nShareholder class action suits.\nIf we were named as a defendant in class action litigation, we could suffer reputational harm with our customers, other purchasers of insurance, shareholders, and the general public. Expenses for the related litigation defense could have a materially adverse effect on our operations or results.\nRisks Related to Our Investments Segment\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk in our investment portfolio.\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk primarily related to the market price, and cash flow variability, associated with changes in interest rates. Recent economic data points to increased U.S. and global economic growth, continued low levels of unemployment, and signs of rising wages, which compounded with the potential for the pro-growth benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"Tax Reform\") and the potential for higher federal budget deficits, has recently led to rising U.S. interest rates. A rise in interest rates may decrease the fair value of our existing fixed income investments and declines in interest rates may result in an increase in the fair value of our existing fixed income investments. Our fixed income securities portfolio, which currently has an effective duration of 3.8 years, contains interest rate sensitive instruments that may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates resulting from governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors beyond our control. A rise in interest rates would decrease the net unrealized gain position of the investment portfolio or create a net unrealized loss. This would be partially offset by our ability to earn higher rates of return on funds reinvested in new investments. Conversely, a decline in interest rates would increase the net unrealized gain position of the investment portfolio, partially offset by lower rates of return on new and reinvested cash in the portfolio. Changes in interest rates have an effect on the calculated duration of certain securities in the portfolio. We seek to mitigate our interest rate risk associated with holding fixed income investments by monitoring and maintaining the average duration of our portfolio with a view toward achieving an adequate after-tax return without subjecting the portfolio to an unreasonable level of interest rate risk. This may include investing in floating rate securities, which currently represent 16% of our fixed income portfolio, and other shorter duration securities that exhibit low effective duration and interest rate risk, but expose the portfolio to other risks, including the risk of a change in credit spreads, liquidity spreads, and other factors that may adversely impact the\nvalue of the portfolio, including a decline in short-term interest rates, such as the 90-day London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"), which would result in lower yields and lower net investment income from our floating rate securities. Although we take measures to manage the economic risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, we may not be able to mitigate the interest rate risk of our assets relative to our liabilities, particularly our loss reserves. In addition, our pension and post-retirement benefit obligations include a discount rate assumption, which is an important element of expense and/or liability measurement. Changes in the discount rate assumption could materially impact our pension and post-retirement life valuation.\nMany of our floating rate securities are tied to the U.S. dollar-denominated LIBOR, which will be eliminated by the end of 2021. LIBOR is used to calculate interest rates for numerous types of debt obligations, including personal and commercial loans, interest rate swaps, and other derivative products, making it a primary metric in the global banking system. LIBOR is set every business day in numerous currencies and maturities, based on estimates submitted by major banks. In the wake of the financial crisis, several banks were discovered to have doctored estimates in order to manipulate LIBOR, promoting a push for submissions based on actual interbank loans. According to the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\"), the interbank lending market slowed in recent years, resulting in a lack of data on which to base LIBOR estimates and therefore susceptible to further fraud. The FCA determined that, without an active market to support estimates, LIBOR should not be used as a benchmark rate. In anticipation of the elimination of LIBOR, the U.S. Federal Reserve established the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) to select a replacement index for U.S. Dollar LIBOR. ARRC, comprised of a group of large domestic banks and regulators, voted to use a benchmark based on short-term loans backed by Treasury securities, known as repurchase agreements or \"repo\" trades. ARRC is expected to announce a transition plan for the new rate. We are unsure whether the elimination of LIBOR and the transition to a new rate will have any impact on the performance of our floating rate securities.\nWe are exposed to credit risk in our investment portfolio.\nThe value of our investment portfolio is subject to credit risk from the issuers and/or guarantors and insurers of the securities we hold and other counterparties in certain transactions. Defaults on any of our investments by any issuer, guarantor, insurer, or other counterparties could reduce our net investment income and net realized investment gains - or result in investment losses. We are subject to the risk that the issuers or guarantors of fixed income securities we own may default on principal and interest payments obligations. Changes in the financial market environment and general sentiment about the broad economy may impact the credit spreads demanded by fixed income investors and negatively impact the fair market value of our fixed income securities. At December 31, 2018, our fixed income securities portfolio represented approximately 89% of our total invested assets. Approximately 98% of these fixed income securities were investment grade and 2% were rated below investment grade, resulting in an average credit rating of AA- for our fixed income securities portfolio. Our fixed income portfolio spread duration, which reflects the portfolio's sensitivity to changes in credit spread, is currently 4.4 years. Over time, our exposure to below investment grade securities and other credit sensitive risk assets may fluctuate as we continue to diversify the portfolio and add or reduce risk commensurate with market conditions and our risk-taking capacity. Events adversely impacting issuers or guarantors of fixed income securities, such as a major economic downturn, acts of corporate malfeasance, widening credit spreads, budgetary deficits, and municipal bankruptcies spurred by, among other things, pension funding issues, could cause the value of our fixed income securities portfolio and our net income to decline and the default rate of our fixed income securities portfolio to increase.\nEconomic uncertainty could adversely affect the credit quality of fixed income issuers or guarantors, and a ratings downgrade in any of our holdings could cause the value of our fixed income securities portfolio and our net income to decrease. As our stockholders' equity is leveraged to our investment portfolio at 3.3:1, a reduction in the value of our investment portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and debt ratings. Levels of write-downs are impacted by our assessment of the impairment, including a review of the underlying collateral of our residential mortgage-backed securities (\"RMBS\"), commercial mortgage-backed securities (\"CMBS\"), collateralized loan obligations (\"CLOs\"), and other asset-backed securities (\"ABS\"), including structured note obligations, and our intent and ability to hold securities that have declined in value until recovery. If we reposition or realign portions of the portfolio and determine not to hold certain securities in an unrealized loss position to recovery, we will incur an OTTI charge. For further information regarding credit and interest rate risk, see Item 7A. \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nOur statutory surplus may be materially affected by rating downgrades on investments held in our portfolio.\nWe are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risks, primarily related to interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, and market value fluctuations in our alternative investment portfolio. We could experience a decline in both income and our investment portfolio asset values related to many different scenarios, including: (i) a decrease in market liquidity; (ii) fluctuations in interest rates; (iii) decreased dividend payment rates; (iv) negative market perception of credit risk with respect to types of securities in our portfolio; (v) a decline in the performance of the underlying collateral of our RMBS, CMBS, CLOs,\nand other ABS; (vi) reduced returns on our alternative investment portfolio; or (vii) general market conditions. A global decline in asset values will be more amplified in our financial condition, as our statutory surplus is leveraged at a 3.2:1 ratio to our investment portfolio.\nEconomic uncertainty could adversely affect the credit quality and ratings of securities in our portfolio. If the NAIC were to apply a more adverse class code on a security than was originally assigned, our statutory surplus could be adversely affected because securities with NAIC class codes three through six are carried at fair market value and securities with NAIC class codes of one or two are carried at amortized cost under statutory accounting rules. For those securities carried at fair market value, see the risk factor immediately following regarding the risks around the methodologies used in determining these valuations.\nWe value our investments using methodologies, estimations, and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations. Changes in these interpretations could result in fluctuations in the valuations of our investments that may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nFixed income, equity, and short-term investments, which are reported at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, represented the majority of our total cash and invested assets as of December 31, 2018. As accounting rules require, we have categorized these securities into a three-level hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the respective valuation technique:\n1.\nThe highest priority is given to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1).\n2.\nThe next priority is to quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or in markets that are not active and other inputs that can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities (Level 2).\n3.\nThe lowest priority in the fair value hierarchy is to unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and that reflect the reporting entity\u2019s own assumptions about the exit price, including assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability (Level 3).\nAn asset or liability\u2019s classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of significant input to its valuation. We generally use an independent pricing service and broker quotes to price our investment securities. At December 31, 2018, approximately 1% of our fixed income securities were priced with Level 1 inputs and 98% of our fixed income securities were priced with Level 2 inputs. However, prices provided by independent pricing services and brokers can vary widely even for the same security. Rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements (\u201cFinancial Statements\u201d) and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. Decreases in value may result in an increase in non-cash OTTI charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nThe determination of the amount of impairments taken on our investments is highly subjective and could materially impact our results of operations or our financial position.\nThe determination of the amount of impairments taken on our investments is based on our periodic evaluation and assessment of our investments and known and inherent risks associated with the various asset classes. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in impairments when the evaluations are made. There can be no assurance that management has accurately assessed the level of impairments taken as reflected in our Financial Statements. Additional impairments may need to be taken in the future. It also is possible that interest rates, currently below historical averages, will increase. If they do, net unrealized gains may be reduced and net unrealized losses associated with declines in value strictly related to such interest rate movements may result. If that happens and we sell those impacted securities, we could experience realized losses or increased OTTI if we determine we do not have the ability and intent to hold those securities until they recover in value. Because our investment managers actively manage our fixed income securities portfolio, our OTTI also may fluctuate from period-to-period if the value of securities we may intend to sell despite being in an unrealized loss position increases. Historical impairment trends may not be indicative of future events. For further information about our evaluation and considerations for determining whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired, please refer to \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d in Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nWe are subject to the types of risks inherent in investing in private limited partnerships.\nOur other investments include investments in private limited partnerships that invest in various strategies, such as private equity, private credit, and real assets. Since the primary assets or liabilities underlying the investments in these limited partnerships generally do not have quoted prices in active markets for the same or similar assets, the valuation of our interests in these limited partnerships is subject to (i) a higher level of subjectivity and unobservable inputs than substantially all of our other investments and (ii) greater scrutiny and reconsideration from one reporting period to the next. Because these limited partnership investments are recorded under the equity method of accounting, any valuation decreases could negatively impact our results of operations. We currently expect to increase our allocation to these investments, which may result in additional variability in our net investment income.\nChanges in tax law could adversely affect our investments results.\nChanges in the tax laws and regulations of U.S. federal, state, and local governments may adversely impact us. Our investment portfolio benefits from tax exemptions and certain other tax law advantages, including those governing dividends received and tax-advantaged municipal bond interest. Future federal and/or state tax law changes could lessen or eliminate some or all of these favorable tax advantages, negatively impact the value of our investment portfolio, and materially and adversely impact our results of operations. It also is possible that the elimination of the state and local tax deduction (the \"SALT deduction\") for U.S. taxpayers filing Federal income tax returns could negatively impact the financial strength of issuers of state and local municipal securities in our portfolio, reduce the value of our investment portfolio, and materially and adversely impact our results of operations. The SALT deduction elimination and the reduction of mortgage interest deductibility to purchase money mortgages of $750,000 or less also could adversely impact the value or volatility of residential real estate markets, which would impact various classes of our investments, such as residential mortgage-backed securities and other asset classes backed by mortgages, or real estate. Ultimately, this could reduce the value of our investment portfolio, and materially and adversely impact our results of operations.\nUncertainty regarding domestic and international political developments and their impact on the economy could lead to investment losses, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and debt ratings.\nAs a property and casualty insurance holding company, we depend on income from our investment portfolio for a significant portion of our revenue and earnings. Our investment portfolio is exposed to significant financial and capital market risks, both in the U.S. and abroad. Volatile changes in general market or economic conditions could lead to a decline in the market value of our portfolio as well as the performance of the underlying collateral of our RMBS, CMBS, CLOs, and other ABS. The current political climate has created more uncertainty about U.S. domestic and foreign policy that may elevate the volatility of the financial markets and adversely impact our investment portfolio.\nOur notes payable and line of credit are subject to certain debt-to-capitalization restrictions and net worth covenants that a significant decline in investment value could impact. Significant future declines in investment value also could require further OTTI charges. Depending on future market conditions, such as an extreme prolonged market event like the global credit crisis, we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in future periods that could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition, debt and financial strength ratings, and our ability to access capital markets.\nFor more information regarding market interest rate, credit, and equity price risk, see Item 7A. \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure and Governance\nWe are a holding company and our ability to declare dividends to our shareholders, pay indebtedness, and enter into affiliate transactions may be limited because our Insurance Subsidiaries are regulated.\nRestrictions on the ability of the Insurance Subsidiaries to pay dividends, make loans or advances to us, or enter into transactions with affiliates may materially affect our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or repay our indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Parent had retained earnings of $1.9 billion. Of this amount, $1.7 billion was related to investments in our Insurance Subsidiaries. In 2019, the Insurance Subsidiaries have the ability to provide for $210 million in ordinary annual dividends to us in 2019 under applicable state regulation; but their ability to pay dividends or make loans or advances to us is subject to the approval or review of the insurance regulators in the states where they are domiciled. The standards for review of such transactions are whether: (i) the terms and charges are fair and reasonable; and (ii) after the transaction, the Insurance Subsidiary's surplus for policyholders is reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and financial needs. Although dividends and loans to us from our Insurance Subsidiaries historically have been approved, we can make no assurance that future dividends and loans will be approved. For additional details regarding dividend restrictions, see\nNote 19. \u201cStatutory Financial Information, Capital Requirements, and Restrictions on Dividends and Transfers of Funds\u201d in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" of this Form 10-K.\nIn addition to regulatory restrictions on the availability of dividends that our Insurance Subsidiaries can pay to the Parent, the maximum amount of dividends the Parent can pay to our shareholders is limited by certain New Jersey corporate law provisions that limit dividends if either: (i) the Parent would be unable to pay its debts as they became due in the usual course of business; or (ii) the Parent\u2019s total assets would be less than its total liabilities. The Parent\u2019s ability to pay dividends to shareholders also are impacted by covenants in its Line of Credit agreement that obligate it, among other things, to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth, statutory surplus, and debt-to-capital ratio. For additional details about the Line of Credit\u2019s financial covenants, see Note 10. \u201cIndebtedness\u201d in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K.\nBecause we are an insurance holding company and a New Jersey corporation, we may be less attractive to potential acquirers and the value of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nBecause we are an insurance holding company that owns insurance subsidiaries, anyone who seeks to acquire 10% or more of our stock must seek prior approval from the insurance regulators in the states in which the subsidiaries are organized and file extensive information regarding their business operations and finances.\nProvisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation may discourage, delay, or prevent us from being acquired, including:\n\u2022\nSupermajority shareholder voting requirements to approve certain business combinations with interested shareholders (as defined in the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation) unless certain other conditions are satisfied; and\n\u2022\nSupermajority shareholder voting requirements to amend the foregoing provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.\nIn addition to the requirements in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the New Jersey Shareholders\u2019 Protection Act also prohibits us from engaging in certain business combinations with interested stockholders (as defined in the statute), in certain instances for a five-year period, and in other instances indefinitely, unless certain conditions are satisfied. These conditions may relate to, among other things, the interested stockholder\u2019s acquisition of stock, the approval of the business combination by disinterested members of our Board of Directors and disinterested stockholders, and the price and payment of the consideration proposed in the business combination. Such conditions are in addition to those requirements set forth in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.\nThese provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and New Jersey law could have the effect of depriving our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium over our common stock\u2019s prevailing market price in the event of a hostile takeover and may adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Evolving Legislation and Public Policy Debates\nWe face risks regarding our flood business because of uncertainties regarding the NFIP.\nWe are the fifth largest insurance group in the WYO arrangement of the NFIP, which is managed by the Mitigation Division of FEMA in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Under the arrangement, we receive an expense allowance for policies written and a servicing fee for claims administered, and all losses are 100% reinsured by the Federal Government. The current expense allowance is 30.0% of DPW. The servicing fee is the combination of 0.9% of DPW and 1.5% of incurred losses.\nAs a WYO carrier, we are required to follow certain NFIP procedures in the administration of flood policies and claims. Some of these requirements may differ from our normal business practices and may present a reputational risk to our brand. While insurance companies are regulated by the states and the NFIP requires WYO carriers to be licensed in the states in which they operate, the NFIP is a federal program and WYO carriers are fiscal agents of the U.S. Government and must follow the NFIP's directives. Consequently, we have the risk that directives from the NFIP and a state regulator on the same issue may conflict.\nThe NFIP was authorized until May 31, 2019, as a short-term solution while Congress continues to debate a more comprehensive proposal. There continues to be significant public policy and political debate in Congress about an extension of the NFIP, appropriate compensation for the WYO carriers, and solutions for flood risk throughout the country. Effective October 2018, FEMA, on its own initiative, revised the arrangement by: (i) reducing the WYO\u2019s expense allowance by 0.9 points, from 30.9% to 30.0%; and (ii) eliminating the provision allowing FEMA to increase a WYO\u2019s expense allowance by one percentage point to cover additional incurred expenses.\nOur flood business could be impacted by: (i) a lapse in program authorization; (ii) further changes to WYO carrier compensation; (iii) any mandate for primary insurance carriers to provide flood insurance; or (iv) private writers becoming more prevalent in the marketplace. The uncertainty created by the public policy debate and politics of flood insurance reform makes it difficult for us to predict the future of the NFIP and our continued participation in the program.\nWe are subject to risk that enacted legislation might significantly change insurance regulation and adversely impacts our business, financial condition, and/or the results of operations.\nWe cannot predict what federal and state rules or legislation will be proposed and adopted, or what impact, if any, such proposals or the cost of compliance with such proposals, could have on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nIn 2009, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act to address corporate governance and control issues identified in the financial crises in 2008 and 2009 and the non-insurance subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. One of the key Dodd-Frank Act provisions created the FIO as part of the U.S. Department of Treasury to advise the federal government on insurance issues. Another Dodd-Frank Act provision requires the Federal Reserve, through the Financial Services Oversight Council (\u201cFSOC\u201d), to supervise financial service firms designated as systemically important financial institutions (\"SIFI\"). We are not and do not expect to be designated as a SIFI. Included among Dodd-Frank's corporate governance reforms for public companies were proxy access, say-on-pay, and other compensation and governance issues. A number of Dodd-Frank reform bills have been introduced, but it is uncertain whether any proposal will pass into law.\nIn general, the Trump Administration and the current Republican Senate majority favor less federal involvement in insurance. Legislative proposals, however, could involve the federal government directly in regulating the business of insurance. President Trump and the Republican Senate majority favor the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\"). Repeal of the ACA presents some legal and practical challenges. Some reform proposals include a provision to permit sales of insurance across state lines, which is not permitted under current federal law without approval of the respective state insurance regulators. Some ACA reforms call for the elimination of the anti-trust exemptions for health insurers under the McCarran-Ferguson Act (\"MFA\"). While we are not a health insurer, property and casualty insurers operate under anti-trust exemptions that permit the aggregation of claims and other data in numbers actuarially and statistically sufficient to price insurance. If the MFA were repealed for the property and casualty industry, we would have to seek a business practices exemption from the Department of Justice to share information with other insurers. In the election of November 2018, the Republicans lost their majority in the House of Representatives. Given the Democratic House Majority, we do not expect ACA repeal to be advanced for the foreseeable future. The Democratic House, however, may advance public policy positions or legislation focused on consumer issues and/or disclosures that may impact the manner in which we conduct our insurance operations. We cannot predict the impact that such a public policy debate or legislative event could have on our product and services supplier relationships, results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals in various states sometimes seek to limit the ability of insurers to assess insurance risk, including limiting or prohibiting the use of certain factors or predictive measures in property and casualty underwriting such as insurance scores and marketplace considerations. There are also proposals from time-to-time to impose new or higher standards on claims settlement practices. These proposals, if enacted, could impact underwriting pricing, loss and loss expenses, and results of operations.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals and public policy debates in various states and among legal experts also impact tort and insurance law, positively and negatively in relation to our business. For example, tort reform proposals may limit the amounts recoverable for certain torts or limit the statute of limitations on certain torts. Conversely, there are proposals to expand, in some cases retroactively, the statute of limitations for certain torts or misdeeds, such as sexual abuse and molestation. Further, legal expert groups like the American Law Institute (\"ALI\") traditionally have summarized and restated the common law in various areas. The ALI's Restatement of the Law, Liability, Insurance, expected to be published in 2019, differs from traditional restatements and offers concepts about insurance law that are not established in legal precedents. Depending on the proposal or initiative, if enacted or adopted, underwriting pricing, loss and loss expenses, and results of operations could be impacted positively or negatively.\nBecause some of our claims cannot be settled and are litigated, our loss and loss expenses may be impacted by our ability to promptly try cases. State court systems, in which many of our litigated claims cases reside, are subject to legislative funding, which is not always to the levels requested by the judicial branch. Consequently, some courts have overcrowded dockets, particularly with criminal, family, and small claims matters. According to the National Center for State Court's Court Statistic's Project, www.courtstatistics.org, tort cases, which represent the great majority of insurance claims cases, only represent between two and four percent of most state court dockets. Only one percent of those tort cases in which evidence is introduced - whether before a judge or a jury - wind up being tried to completion. Most cases settle and, with fewer cases being tried and\nappealed, there are fewer reported judicial decisions that contribute to the common law. We are unsure as to the ultimate impact that crowded court dockets may have on our loss and loss expenses, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our General Operations\nThe failure of our risk management strategies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nAs an insurance provider, it is our business to take on risk from our customers. Our long-term strategy includes the use of above average operational leverage, which can be measured as the ratio of NPW to our equity or policyholders surplus. We balance operational leverage risk with a number of risk management strategies within our insurance operations to achieve a balance of growth and profit and to reduce our exposure. These strategies include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nBeing disciplined in our underwriting practices;\n\u2022\nBeing prudent in our claims management practices, establishing adequate loss and loss expense reserves, and placing appropriate reliance on our claims analytics;\n\u2022\nContinuing to develop and implement various underwriting tools and automated analytics to examine historical statistical data regarding our customers and their loss experience to: (i) classify such policies based on that information; (ii) apply that information to current and prospective accounts; and (iii) better predict account profitability;\n\u2022\nContinuing to develop our customer experience platform as we grow in our understanding of customer segmentation;\n\u2022\nPurchasing reinsurance and using catastrophe modeling;\n\u2022\nBeing disciplined in our monitoring of, and management over, our ERM framework; and\n\u2022\nBeing prudent in our financial planning process, which supports our underwriting strategies.\nWe also maintain a conservative approach to our investment portfolio management and employ risk management strategies that include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nBeing prudent in establishing our investment policy and appropriately diversifying our investments, which supports our liabilities and underwriting strategies;\n\u2022\nUsing models to analyze historical investment performance and predict future investment performance under a variety of scenarios using asset concentration, asset volatility, asset correlation, and systematic risk; and\n\u2022\nClosely monitoring investment performance, general economic and financial conditions, and other relevant factors.\nAll of these strategies have inherent limitations. We cannot be certain that an event or series of unanticipated events will not occur and result in losses greater than we expect and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nOperational risks, including human or systems failures, are inherent in our business.\nOperational risks and losses can result from, among other things, fraud, errors, failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization, failure to comply with regulatory requirements, information technology failures, or external events.\nOur predictive models for underwriting, claims, and catastrophe losses, as well as our business analytics and our information technology and application systems are critical to our business. We expect our information technology and application systems to remain an important part of our underwriting process and our ability to compete successfully. A major defect or failure in our internal controls or information technology and application systems could: (i) result in management distraction; (ii) harm our reputation, particularly if we experience a privacy breach; or (iii) increase our expenses. We believe appropriate controls and mitigation procedures are in place to prevent significant risk of a defect in our internal controls around our information technology and application systems, but internal controls provide only a reasonable, not absolute, assurance as to the absence of errors or irregularities and any ineffectiveness of such controls and procedures could have a significant and negative effect on our business.\nRapid development of new technologies may result in an unexpected impact on our business and the insurance industry overall.\nDevelopment of new technologies continues to impact all aspects of business and individuals\u2019 lives at rapid speed. Often such developments are positive, gradually improving standards of living, the speed of communications, and fostering the development of more efficient processes. The rapid development of new technologies, however, also presents challenges and risks. Examples of such emerging risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nChange in exposures and claims frequency and/or severity due to unanticipated consequences of new technologies and their use. For example, technologies have been developed and are being tested for autonomous self-driving\nautomobiles. It is unclear and we cannot predict the corresponding impact on automobile claims. It is possible that these technological developments will affect the profitability and demand for automobile insurance.\n\u2022\nChanges in how insurance products are marketed and purchased due to the availability of new technologies and changes in customer expectations. For example, comparative rating technologies, which are widely used in personal lines insurance, facilitate the process of efficiently generating quotes from multiple insurance companies. This technology makes differentiation based upon factors other than pricing more difficult and has increased price comparisons, resulting in a higher level of quote activity with a lower percentage of quotes becoming new business written. These trends may continue to accelerate and may affect other lines of business, which could put pressure on our future profitability and growth.\n\u2022\nNew technologies may require the development of new insurance products without the support of sufficient historical claims data for us to continue to compete effectively for our distribution partners' business and customers.\nWe depend on key personnel.\nTo a large extent, our business' success depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees. Competition to attract and retain key personnel is intense. While we have employment agreements with certain key managers, all of our employees are at-will employees and we cannot ensure that we will be able to attract and retain key personnel. As of December 31, 2018, our workforce had an average age of approximately 47 and approximately 18% of our workforce was retirement eligible, which we define as including individuals who are 55 years of age and have 10 or more years of service.\nWe are subject to a variety of modeling risks, which could have a material adverse impact on our business results.\nWe rely on internally or third-party developed complex financial models, such as those that predict underwriting results on individual risks and our overall portfolio, claims fraud, impacts from catastrophes, enterprise risk management capital scenarios, and investment portfolio changes, to analyze historical loss costs and pricing, trends in claims severity and frequency, the occurrence of catastrophe losses, investment performance, and portfolio risk. Flaws in these financial models or in the assumptions made in them could lead to increased losses. We believe that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable method for monitoring and controlling risk and are tools that do not substitute for the experience or judgment of senior management.\nWe are subject to attempted cyber-attacks and other cybersecurity risks.\nOur business heavily relies on various information technology and application systems that are connected to, or may be accessed from, the Internet and may be impacted by a malicious cyber-attack. Our systems also contain proprietary and confidential information, including personally identifiable information, about our operations, our employees, our agents, our customers, and their employees and property. A malicious cyber-attack on our systems or those of our vendors may interrupt our ability to operate and impact our results of operations. We have and expect to continue to: (i) implement employee education programs and tabletop exercises; and (ii) develop and invest in a variety of controls to prevent, detect, and appropriately react to cyber-attacks, including frequently testing our systems' security and access controls.\nCyber-attacks continue to become more complex and broad-ranging, and our internal controls provide only a reasonable, not absolute, assurance that we will be able to protect ourselves from significant cyber-attack incidents. By outsourcing certain business and administrative functions to third parties, we may be exposed to enhanced risk of data security breaches. Any breach of our systems or data security could damage our reputation and/or result in monetary damages that, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings. Although we have not experienced a material cyber-attack breach, it is possible that one might occur. We have insurance coverage for certain cybersecurity risks, including privacy breach incidents, that provides protection up to $20 million above a deductible of $1 million. In addition, within our Standard Commercial Lines segment, we offer cyber-related insurance products for which we have mitigated the majority of the related risk through protection under our reinsurance treaties.\nGiven the increased number of identity thefts from cyber-attacks, federal and state policymakers have, and will likely continue to propose increased regulation of the protection of personally identifiable information and appropriate protocols after a related cybersecurity breach. The New York Department of Financial Services recently adopted a cyber protection and reporting regulation for financial services companies with which we are complying. The NAIC also has adopted a model regulation based on the New York regulation, which several states adopted in 2018, and we expect other states will consider adopting in 2019. California passed a broad-reaching new Consumer Privacy Act in 2018 that layers additional obligations and penalties on companies that collect a variety of personal information. Compliance with these regulations and efforts to address continually developing cybersecurity risks may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nChanges in tax law could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to the tax laws and regulations of U.S. federal, state, and local governments, and their amendment could adversely impact us. For example, the U.S. tax code was recently amended to reduce the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective for the 2018 tax year. As a result, our deferred tax assets were reduced and we were required to recognize a reduction of a previously-recognized federal tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017 when enacted. Potential future tax rule changes may increase or decrease our actual tax expense and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we experience difficulties with outsourcing relationships, our ability to conduct our business might be negatively impacted.\nWe currently outsource certain business and administrative functions to third parties for expediency, efficiency and economies of scale and this outsourcing may increase in the future. If we or our third-party partners falter in the development, implementation, or execution of our outsourcing strategies, we may experience operational difficulties, increased costs, and customer losses that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We have supplemental staffing service agreements with multiple consulting, information technology, and service providers that supply approximately 50% of our skilled technology capacity. These resources are principally based in the U.S., although some of the resources are foreign. The impact of the recently-enacted U.S. tax reform on the availability and cost of these services is still uncertain.", "PERMNO": 68292, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "SIGI"}
