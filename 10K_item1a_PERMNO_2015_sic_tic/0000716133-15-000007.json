{"cik": "716133", "company": "CINCINNATI BELL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us. Our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations could be materially affected by any of these risks.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nThe Company\u2019s substantial debt could limit its ability to fund operations, raise additional capital, and fulfill its obligations, which, in turn, would have a material adverse effect on its businesses and prospects generally.\nThe Company has a substantial amount of debt and has significant debt service obligations. As of December 31, 2014, the Company and its subsidiaries had outstanding indebtedness of $1,784.2 million, on which it incurred $148.7 million of interest expense in 2014, and had total shareowners\u2019 deficit of $648.5 million. At December 31, 2014, the Company and its subsidiaries had $90.7 million of borrowing availability under its accounts receivable securitization facility (\"Receivables Facility\"), and had the ability to borrow up to an additional $150.0 million under the Corporate Credit Agreement's revolving credit facility, subject to compliance with certain conditions. In addition, the Company's ability to incur additional debt from time to time is subject to the restrictions contained in its credit facilities and other debt instruments.\nThe Company\u2019s substantial debt has important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe Company is required to use a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on its debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nthere is a variable interest rate on a portion of its debt which could increase if the market rates increase;\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s substantial debt increases its vulnerability to adverse changes in the credit markets, which adverse changes could increase the Company's borrowing costs and limit the availability of financing;\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s debt service obligations limit its flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in its business and the industries in which it operates;\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s level of debt and shareowners\u2019 deficit may restrict it from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, and other general corporate requirements; and\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s debt instruments require the Company to comply with specified financial ratios and other restrictive covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants, if not cured or waived, could limit availability to the cash required to fund the Company's operations and general obligations and could result in the Company\u2019s dissolution, bankruptcy, liquidation, or reorganization.\nThe Company\u2019s creditors and preferred stockholders have claims that are superior to claims of the holders of the Company's common stock. Accordingly, in the event of the Company\u2019s dissolution, bankruptcy, liquidation, or reorganization, payment is first made on the claims of creditors of the Company and its subsidiaries, then preferred stockholders, and finally, if amounts are available, to holders of the Company's common stock.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nThe Corporate Credit Agreement and other indebtedness impose significant restrictions on the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s debt instruments impose, and the terms of any future debt may impose, operating and other restrictions on the Company. These restrictions affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, among other things, the Company\u2019s ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nguarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022\ndeclare or pay dividends or other distributions to shareholders;\n\u2022\nrepurchase equity interests;\n\u2022\nredeem debt that is junior in right of payment to such indebtedness;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments from subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nissue or sell capital stock of certain of its subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, or transfer all or substantially all of its assets and the assets of its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s Corporate Credit Agreement and debt instruments include restrictive covenants that may materially limit the Company\u2019s ability to prepay debt and redeem preferred stock. The agreements governing the Corporate Credit Agreement also require the Company to achieve and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios.\nThe restrictions contained in the terms of the Corporate Credit Agreement and its other debt instruments could:\n\u2022\nlimit the Company\u2019s ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet capital needs or otherwise restrict the Company\u2019s activities or business plans; and\n\u2022\nadversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to finance its operations, strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances, or other capital needs, or to engage in other business activities that would be in its interest.\nA breach of any of the debt's restrictive covenants or the Company\u2019s inability to comply with the required financial ratios would result in a default under some or all of the debt agreements. During the occurrence and continuance of a default, lenders may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. Additionally, under the Corporate Credit Agreement, the lenders may elect not to provide loans until such default is cured or waived. The Company\u2019s debt instruments also contain cross-acceleration provisions, which generally cause each instrument to be subject to early repayment of outstanding principal and related interest upon a qualifying acceleration of any other debt instrument. Failure to comply with these covenants, if not cured or waived, would limit the cash required to fund operations and its general obligations and could result in the Company\u2019s dissolution, bankruptcy, liquidation, or reorganization.\nThe Company depends on its Corporate Credit Agreement and Receivables Facility to provide for its short-term financing requirements in excess of amounts generated by operations, and the availability of those funds may be reduced or limited.\nThe Company depends on the revolving credit facility under its Corporate Credit Agreement and Receivables Facility to provide for short-term financing requirements in excess of amounts generated by operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Corporate Credit Agreement's revolving credit facility, leaving $150.0 million in additional borrowing availability under this facility. The $150.0 million available under the Corporate Credit Agreement's revolving credit facility is funded by various financial institutions. If one or more of these banks is not able to fulfill its funding obligations, the Company\u2019s financial condition would be adversely affected.\nEffective with the sale of our 16.0 million partnership units to CyrusOne, Inc. on June 25, 2014 for $355.9 million, the amount available under the Corporate Credit Agreement's revolving credit facility was reduced to $150.0 million from its original capacity of $200.0 million. In addition, the original revolving commitments will be further reduced to $125.0 million on December 31, 2015.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nIn addition, the Company's ability to borrow under its Corporate Credit Agreement is subject to the Company's compliance with covenants, including covenants requiring compliance with specified financial ratios. Failure to satisfy these covenants would constrain or prohibit its ability to borrow under these facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company had $19.2 million of borrowings and $6.9 million of letters of credit that were outstanding under its Receivables Facility. At that date, the Company had a borrowing capacity under this Receivables Facility of $116.8 million and a maximum borrowing limit of $120.0 million. The available borrowing capacity is calculated monthly based on the quantity and quality of outstanding accounts receivable and thus may be lower than the maximum borrowing limit. If the quality of the Company\u2019s accounts receivables deteriorates, this will negatively impact the available capacity under this facility. As of December 31, 2014, the Company had $90.7 million of borrowing capacity remaining under its Receivables Facility.\nThe servicing of the Company\u2019s indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash, and its ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond its control.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors, many of which are beyond its control. The Company cannot provide assurance that its business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, additional sources of debt financing will be available, or future borrowings will be available under its Corporate Credit Agreement or Receivables Facility, in each case, in amounts sufficient to enable the Company to service its indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. If the Company cannot service its indebtedness, it will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, or selling assets, including its investment in CyrusOne, restructuring or refinancing indebtedness, or seeking additional equity capital, which may adversely affect its shareholders, debt holders, and customers. The Company may not be able to negotiate remedies on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict the Company from adopting any of these alternatives. The Company\u2019s inability to generate the necessary cash flows could result in its dissolution, bankruptcy, liquidation, or reorganization.\nThe Company depends on the receipt of dividends or other intercompany transfers from its subsidiaries and investments.\nVirtually all of the Company's operations are conducted through its subsidiaries and most of the Company's debt is held at the parent company. Certain of the Company's material subsidiaries are subject to regulatory authority which may potentially limit the ability of such subsidiaries to distribute funds or assets. If any of the Company's subsidiaries were to be prohibited from paying dividends or making distributions, the Company may not be able to make the scheduled interest and principal repayments on its debt. This failure would have a material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity and the trading price of the Company's common stock, preferred stock, and debt instruments, which could result in its dissolution, bankruptcy, liquidation, or reorganization.\nRisk Factors Related to our Business and Operations\nThe Company\u2019s access lines, which generate a significant portion of its cash flows and profits, are decreasing in number. If the Company continues to experience access line losses similar to the past several years, its revenues, earnings and cash flows from operations may be adversely impacted.\nThe Company generates a substantial portion of its revenues by delivering voice and data services over access lines. The Company's local telecommunications subsidiary, CBT, has experienced substantial access line losses over the past several years due to a number of factors, including increased competition and wireless and broadband substitution. The Company expects access line losses to continue into the foreseeable future. Failure to retain access lines without replacing such losses with an alternative source of revenue would adversely impact the Company's revenues, earnings and cash flow from operations.\nSome of our strategic products generate lower profit margins than our traditional services, and some can be expected to experience slowing growth as increasing numbers of our existing or potential customers subscribe to these newer products. Moreover, we cannot provide assurance that the revenues generated from our new offerings will offset revenue losses from the reduced sales of our legacy products or that our new strategic offerings will be as successful as anticipated.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nThe Company operates in highly competitive industries, and customers may not continue to purchase products or services, which would result in reduced revenue and loss of market share.\nThe telecommunications industry is very competitive, and the Company competes against larger, well-capitalized national providers. Competitors may reduce pricing, create new bundled offerings, or develop new technologies, products, or services. If the Company cannot continue to offer reliable, competitively priced, value-added services, or if the Company does not keep pace with technological advances, competitive forces could adversely affect it through a loss of market share or a decrease in revenue and profit margins. The Company has lost, and will likely continue to lose, access lines as a part of its customer base utilizes the services of competitors or wireless providers.\nThe Wireline segment faces competition from other local exchange carriers, wireless service providers, inter-exchange carriers, and cable, broadband, and internet service providers. Wireless providers, particularly those that provide unlimited wireless service plans with no additional fees for long distance, offer customers a substitution service for the Company\u2019s access lines and long distance lines. The Company believes wireless substitution accounts for the largest portion of its access line losses. Also, cable competitors that have existing service relationships with CBT\u2019s customers also offer substitution services, such as VoIP and long distance voice services in the Company's operating areas. Partially as a result of wireless substitution and increased competition, CBT\u2019s access lines decreased by 9% and long distance subscribers decreased by 8% in 2014 compared to 2013.\nOur strategic products also face intense competition from cable operators, other telecom companies, and niche fiber companies. Many of our competitors have lower operating costs and access to resources that provide economies of scale allowing them to more aggressively price products, which they are able to provide on a much broader scale given their expanded geographic operations. Our competitors are expected to continuously upgrade their service quality and offerings, which could substantially erode the competitive advantage we currently have with our fiber-based products. These competitive factors could limit the Company's ability to grow revenue and cash flows despite the strategic initiatives implemented.\nThe Fioptics suite of products also face competition from a number of different sources, including companies that deliver movies, television shows and other video programming over broadband Internet connections. Increasingly, content owners are utilizing Internet-based delivery of content directly to consumers, some without charging a fee for access to the content. Furthermore, due to consumer electronics innovations, consumers are able to watch such Internet-delivered content on television sets and mobile devices. Increased customer migration to these non-traditional entertainment products could result in increased Fioptics churn and decreased penetration. If the Company is unable to effectively implement strategies to attract and retain Fioptics video and high-speed internet subscribers, retain access lines and long distance subscribers, or replace such customers with other sources of revenue, the Company's Wireline business will be adversely affected.\nThe IT Services and Hardware segment competes against numerous other information technology consulting, web-hosting, and computer system integration companies, many of which are large in scope and well-financed. This market is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. Other competitors may consolidate with larger companies or acquire software application vendors or technology providers, which may provide competitive advantages. The Company believes that many of the participants in this market must grow rapidly and achieve significant scale to compete effectively. This consolidation could affect prices and other competitive factors in ways that could impede our ability to compete successfully in the market.\nThe competitive forces described above could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nFailure to anticipate the need for and introduce new products and services or to compete with new technologies may compromise the Company\u2019s success in the telecommunications industry.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends, in part, on being able to anticipate the needs of current and future business, carrier, and residential customers. The Company seeks to meet these needs through new product introductions, service quality, and technological improvements. New products and services are important to the Company\u2019s success because its industry is technologically driven, such that new technologies can offer alternatives to the Company\u2019s existing services. The development of new technologies and products could accelerate the Company\u2019s loss of access lines or limit the growth from its strategic products, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s revenue, results of operations, and cash flows.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nAccelerating the pace of investment in our Fioptics suite of products could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nIn order to take advantage of a unique opportunity in our market, and due to a progressive change in customer expectations of increased internet speeds, beginning in 2014 we began accelerating the pace of investment in our Fioptics suite of products, and intend to continue such accelerated investments through 2016. There are several factors that could result in a negative effect on our revenue, operating income and cash flows, such as:\n\u2022\nour costs could significantly exceed expectations\n\u2022\nthe acceleration may not generate the expected increase in subscribers\n\u2022\nit may be inefficient to build out the additional fiber at an accelerated rate\n\u2022\nthere may be a lack of workforce to achieve our construction, sales, and installation targets\n\u2022\naccess to the fiber required for our construction plans may be limited\nThe Company may be unable to grow our revenues and cash flows despite the initiatives we have implemented.\nWe must produce adequate revenues and cash flows that, when combined with cash on hand and funds available under our Corporate Credit Agreement and Receivables Facility, will be sufficient to service our debt, fund our capital expenditures, pay our taxes, fund our pension and other employee benefit obligations and pay preferred dividends pursuant to our dividend policy. We have identified some potential areas of opportunity and implemented several growth initiatives, including increasing marketing promotions and related expenditures and launching new products and services with a focus on areas that are growing such as Fioptics and enterprise fiber-based service offerings. We cannot assure you that these opportunities will be successful or that these initiatives will improve our financial position or our results of operations.\nThe Company's failure to meet performance standards under its agreements could result in customers terminating their relationships with the Company or customers being entitled to receive financial compensation, which would lead to reduced revenues and/or increased costs.\nThe Company's agreements with its customers contain various requirements regarding performance and levels of service. If the Company fails to provide the levels of service or performance required by its agreements, customers may be able to receive service credits for their accounts and other financial compensation and also may be able to terminate their relationship with the Company. In order to provide these levels of services, the Company is required to protect against human error, natural disasters, equipment failure, power failure, sabotage and vandalism, and have disaster recovery plans available for disruption of services. The failure to address these or other events may result in a disruption of services. In addition, any inability to meet service level commitments or other performance standards could reduce the confidence of customers and could consequently impair the Company's ability to attract and retain customers, which would adversely affect both the Company's ability to generate revenues and operating results.\nThe Company generates a substantial portion of its revenue by serving a limited geographic area.\nThe Company generates a substantial portion of its revenue by serving customers in the Greater Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio areas. An economic downturn or natural disaster occurring in this limited operating territory would have a disproportionate effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows compared to similar companies of a national scope and similar companies operating in different geographic areas.\nA large customer accounts for a significant portion of the Company\u2019s revenues and accounts receivable. The loss or significant reduction in business from this customer would cause operating revenues to decline significantly and have a materially adverse long-term impact on the Company\u2019s business.\nAs of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had receivables with one large customer that makes up 26% and 19% of the outstanding accounts receivable balance, respectively. This same customer contributed 14% to consolidated revenue for the year ended 2014. Contracts with this customer may not sufficiently reduce the inherent risk that the customer may terminate or fail to renew their relationships with the Company. As a result of customer concentration, the Company's results of operations and financial condition could be materially affected if the Company lost this customer or if services purchased were significantly reduced. If this customer were to default on its accounts receivable obligations, the Company would be exposed to potentially significant losses in excess of the provisions established. This would also negatively impact the available borrowing capacity under the Receivables Facility.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nMaintaining the Company's telecommunications networks requires significant capital expenditures, and its inability or failure to maintain its telecommunications networks would have a material impact on its market share and ability to generate revenue.\nOver the past several years, the Company has improved its wireline network through increased capital expenditures for fiber optic cable in limited areas of its operating network. The Company is accelerating the pace of investment in its Fioptics suite of services and intends to continue to increase its capital expenditures for fiber optic cable through 2016.\nIn order to provide appropriate levels of service to the Company's customers, the network infrastructure must be protected against damage from human error, natural disasters, unexpected equipment failure, power loss or telecommunications failures, terrorism, sabotage, or other intentional acts of vandalism. The Company's networks may not address all of the problems that may be encountered in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated problems, which may result in disruption of service to customers.\nThe Company may also incur significant additional capital expenditures as a result of unanticipated developments, regulatory changes, and other events that impact the business.\nIncreases in broadband usage may cause network capacity limitations, resulting in service disruptions or reduced capacity for customers.\nVideo streaming services and peer-to-peer file sharing applications use significantly more bandwidth than traditional Internet activity such as web browsing and email. As utilization rates and availability of these services continue to grow, our high-speed Internet customers may use much more bandwidth than in the past. If this occurs, we could be required to make significant capital expenditures to increase network capacity in order to avoid service disruptions or reduced capacity for customers.\nWe may not be able to recover the costs of the necessary network investments. This would result in an adverse impact to our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be liable for the material that content providers distribute over our networks.\nThe law relating to the liability of private network operators for information carried on, stored or disseminated through their networks is still unsettled. As such, we could be exposed to legal claims relating to content disseminated on our networks. Claims could challenge the accuracy of materials on our network or could involve matters such as defamation, invasion of privacy or copyright infringement. If we need to take costly measures to reduce our exposure to these risks or are required to defend ourselves against such claims, our financial results would be negatively affected.\nCyber attacks or other breaches of network or other information technology security could have an adverse effect on our business.\nCyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security may cause equipment failures or disruptions to our operations. Our inability to operate our wireline networks as a result of such events, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses and/or loss of market share to other communications providers. In addition, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Cyber attacks, which include the use of malware, computer viruses and other means for disruption or unauthorized access, have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. While, to date, we have not been subject to cyber attacks or other cyber incidents which, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or financial condition, the preventative actions we take to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology and networks may be insufficient to repel a major cyber attack in the future. The costs associated with a major cyber attack could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business, increased expenditures on cyber security measures, lost revenues from business interruption, litigation and damage to our reputation. If we fail to prevent the theft of valuable information such as financial data, sensitive information about the Company and intellectual property, or if we fail to protect the privacy of customer and employee confidential data against breaches of network or information technology security, it would result in damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact customer and investor confidence. Any of these occurrences could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nNatural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations.\nOur business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, power outages, terrorist attacks, other hostile acts and events beyond our control. Such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure, resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers. While we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. These events could also damage the infrastructure of suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers. A natural disaster or other event causing significant physical damage would cause us to experience substantial losses resulting in significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. In addition, these occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption as well as damage to our reputation.\nThe regulation of the Company\u2019s businesses by federal and state authorities may, among other things, place the Company at a competitive disadvantage, restrict its ability to price its products and services, and threaten its operating licenses.\nSeveral of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are subject to regulatory oversight of varying degrees at both the state and federal levels, which may differ from the regulatory scrutiny faced by the Company\u2019s competitors. A significant portion of CBT\u2019s revenue is derived from pricing plans that require regulatory overview and approval. These regulated pricing plans limit the rates CBT charges for some services while the competition has typically been able to set rates for services with limited restriction. In the future, regulatory initiatives that would put CBT at a competitive disadvantage or mandate lower rates for its services would result in lower profitability and cash flows for the Company. In addition, different regulatory interpretations of existing regulations or guidelines may affect the Company\u2019s revenues and expenses in future periods.\nAt the federal level, CBT is subject to the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the \"1996 Act\"), including the rules subsequently adopted by the FCC to implement the 1996 Act, which has impacted CBT\u2019s in-territory local exchange operations in the form of greater competition. At the state level, CBT conducts local exchange operations in portions of Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana, and, consequently, is subject to regulation by the Public Utilities Commissions in those states. Various regulatory decisions or initiatives at the federal or state level may from time to time have a negative impact on CBT\u2019s ability to compete in its markets.\nFrom time to time, different regulatory agencies conduct audits to ensure that the Company is in compliance with the respective regulations. The Company could be subject to fines and penalties if found to be out of compliance with these regulations, and these fines and penalties could be material to the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nThere are currently many regulatory actions under way and being contemplated by federal and state authorities regarding issues that could result in significant changes to the business conditions in the telecommunications industry. In addition, in connection with our Internet access offerings, we could become subject to laws and regulations as they are adopted or applied to the Internet. There is currently only limited regulation applicable to these services. As the significance of the Internet continues to grow, federal, state and local governments may pass laws and adopt rules and regulations or apply existing laws and regulations to the Internet (including Internet access services), and related matters are under consideration in both federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies. We cannot provide any assurances that changes in current or future regulations adopted by the FCC or state regulators, or other legislative, administrative, or judicial initiatives relating to the telecommunications industry, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe Company depends on a number of third-party providers, and the loss of, or problems with, one or more of these providers may impede the Company's growth or cause it to lose customers.\nThe Company depends on third-party providers to supply products and services. For example, many of the Company's information technology and call center functions are performed by third-party providers, and network equipment is purchased from and maintained by vendors. The loss of, or problems with one or more of these third-party providers may result in an adverse effect on our ability to provide products and services to our customers and on our results of operations and financial condition.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nA failure of back-office information technology systems could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe efficient operation of the Company\u2019s business depends on back-office information technology systems. The Company relies on back-office information technology systems to effectively manage customer billing, business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment and other business processes. A failure of the Company\u2019s information technology systems to perform as anticipated could disrupt the Company\u2019s business and result in a failure to collect accounts receivable, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing the Company\u2019s reputation and results of operations to suffer. In addition, information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond the Company\u2019s control, including fire, natural disasters, systems failures, security breaches and viruses. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nIf the Company fails to extend or renegotiate its collective bargaining agreements with its labor union when they expire or if its unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, the Company\u2019s business and operating results could be materially harmed.\nThe Company is a party to collective bargaining agreements with its labor union, which represents a significant number of its employees, and these collective bargaining agreements expired in August 2014. At that time, the Company reached a tentative agreement with the CWA on a new labor contract. This contract was not ratified by local members of the union on two separate occasions and the two parties have resumed negotiations. If a resolution is not achieved, a work force stoppage could occur resulting in a negative effect on our revenue, operating income and cash flows.\nNo assurance can be given that the Company will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate its collective bargaining agreements. If the Company fails to extend or renegotiate its collective bargaining agreements, if disputes with its union arise, or if its unionized workers engage in a strike or a work stoppage, the Company could experience a significant disruption of operations or incur higher ongoing labor costs, either of which would have a material adverse effect on the business.\nThe loss of any of the senior management team or attrition among key sales associates could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s success will continue to depend to a significant extent on its senior management team and key sales associates. Senior management has specific knowledge relating to the Company and the industry that would be difficult to replace. The loss of key sales associates could hinder the Company\u2019s ability to continue to benefit from long-standing relationships with customers. The Company cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to retain the current senior management team or key sales associates. The loss of any of these individuals could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Investment in CyrusOne\nThe Company no longer controls the operations of CyrusOne.\nAs of January 24, 2013, CyrusOne is an independent public company which the Company does not control. As a result, the Company no longer sets the strategies, selects the management team, or controls the operations of CyrusOne. CyrusOne may choose to pursue strategies which conflict with our business strategies, and, if this were to occur, the CyrusOne Board is required to act for the benefit of its shareholders.\nThe Company executed a non-compete agreement with CyrusOne under which both parties agreed not to enter each other's lines of business, subject to certain exceptions, for a period of four years. CyrusOne may choose to compete with us after the expiration of this non-compete agreement which could have an adverse effect on our telecommunications business.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nThe Company has a significant investment in CyrusOne.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we effectively own 44% of CyrusOne, which is held in the form of 1.9 million shares of CyrusOne common stock and 26.6 million CyrusOne LP partnership units. The value of our investment is subject to CyrusOne executing on their strategic plan and other factors beyond CyrusOne's control, such as stock market volatility and fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to CyrusOne, all of which could cause significant changes in the market price of CyrusOne's common stock. The fair value of our investment in CyrusOne may decline which may adversely affect the realization of our investment. As a result, we may be unable to monetize any or all of our investment in CyrusOne, which would therefore not allow us to repay debt and achieve a leverage ratio comparable to our peers thereby limiting our opportunity to significantly increase cash flow. Our inability to liquidate our investment in CyrusOne could ultimately limit the cash to fund operations and our general obligations and could result in the Company's dissolution, bankruptcy, liquidation, or reorganization.\nRefer to the CyrusOne 2014 Form 10-K for additional risk disclosures specific to that entity.\nOther Risk Factors\nThe trading price of the Company's common stock may be volatile, and the value of an investment in the Company's common stock may decline.\nThe market price of the Company's common stock has been volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, among other things, the risk factors described in this report and other factors beyond the Company's control, such as stock market volatility and fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to the Company.\nThe stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the Company's stock price and the market prices of equity securities of many other companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, and market conditions, may negatively affect the market price of the Company's stock.\nCompanies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have periodically been subject to securities class action litigation. The Company may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and/or damages and divert management's attention from other business concerns.\nThe Company's failure to remove all subscribers from its wireless network may result in a fine or a penalty adversely affecting revenues, earnings and cash flows.\nOn September 30, 2014, we closed the agreement to sell our wireless spectrum licenses which requires us to cease wireless operations no later than April 6, 2015. Should we still have wireless subscribers at that time, we would be subject to penalty per terms of the agreement. Subsequent to discontinuing wireless operations, we will start the process of decommissioning the network and removing assets and equipment from our remaining tower leases. Any unforeseen complications or delays could negatively impact profitability and cash flows.\nThe uncertain economic environment, including uncertainty in the U.S. and world securities markets, could impact the Company's business and financial condition.\nThe uncertain economic environment could have an adverse effect on the Company's business and financial liquidity. The Company's primary source of cash is customer collections. If economic conditions were to worsen, some customers may cancel services or have difficulty paying. These conditions would result in lower revenues and increases in the allowance for doubtful accounts, which would negatively affect the results of operations. Furthermore, the sales cycle would be further lengthened if business customers slow spending or delay decision-making on the Company's products and services, which would adversely affect revenues. If competitors lower prices as a result of economic conditions, the Company would also experience pricing pressure. If the economies of the U.S. and the world deteriorate, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nThe Company\u2019s future cash flows would be adversely affected if it is unable to fully realize its deferred tax assets.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company had net deferred income taxes of $369.6 million, which are primarily composed of deferred tax assets associated with U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $232.8 million and state, local and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $53.7 million. The Company has recorded valuation allowances against deferred tax assets related to certain state, local and foreign net operating losses and other deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the Company\u2019s ability to utilize the assets within the statutory expiration period. The use of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets enables it to satisfy current and future tax liabilities without the use of the Company\u2019s cash resources. If the Company is unable for any reason to generate sufficient taxable income to fully realize its deferred tax assets, or if the use of its net operating loss carryforwards is limited by Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or similar state statute, the Company\u2019s net income, shareowners\u2019 deficit, and future cash flows would be adversely affected.\nAdverse changes in the value of assets or obligations associated with the Company\u2019s employee benefit plans could negatively impact shareowners\u2019 deficit and liquidity.\nThe Company sponsors three noncontributory defined benefit pension plans: one for eligible management employees, one for non-management employees, and one supplemental, nonqualified, unfunded plan for certain former executives. The Company also provides healthcare and group life insurance benefits for eligible retirees. The Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets indirectly reflect the value of all plan assets and benefit obligations under these plans. The accounting for employee benefit plans is complex, as is the process of calculating the benefit obligations under the plans. Adverse changes in interest rates or market conditions, among other assumptions and factors, could cause a significant increase in the Company\u2019s benefit obligations or a significant decrease of the asset values, without necessarily impacting the Company\u2019s net income. In addition, the Company\u2019s benefit obligations could increase significantly if it needs to unfavorably revise the assumptions used to calculate the obligations. These adverse changes could have a further significant negative impact on the Company\u2019s shareowners\u2019 deficit. In addition, with respect to the Company\u2019s pension plans, the Company expects to make approximately $30 million of estimated aggregate cash contributions to its qualified pension plans for the years 2015 to 2018, of which $13 million is expected to be contributed in 2015. Additionally, the Company\u2019s postretirement costs are adversely affected by increases in medical and prescription drug costs. Further, if there are adverse changes to plan assets, or if medical and prescription drug costs increase significantly, the Company could be required to contribute additional material amounts of cash to the plan or could accelerate the timing of required payments.\nThird parties may claim that the Company is infringing upon their intellectual property, and the Company could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products.\nThe Company may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of its technology, products, or services. Any litigation growing out of third-party patents or other intellectual property claims could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the Company\u2019s management and key personnel from its business operations. The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks. Resolution of claims of intellectual property infringement might also require the Company to enter into costly license agreements. Likewise, the Company may not be able to obtain license agreements on acceptable terms. The Company also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain of its products or services. Further, the Company often relies on licenses of third-party intellectual property for its businesses. The Company cannot ensure these licenses will be available in the future on favorable terms or at all.\nWe could be subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements.\nOur business faces a substantial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, securities class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection processes. In addition, as we wind down our wireless business, we also face personal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters, and class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse effects of handheld wireless phones. We may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards and settlements.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nThird parties may infringe upon the Company\u2019s intellectual property, and the Company may expend significant resources enforcing its rights or suffer competitive injury.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends in significant part on the competitive advantage it gains from its proprietary technology and other valuable intellectual property assets. The Company relies on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets protections, confidentiality provisions, and licensing arrangements to establish and protect its intellectual property rights. If the Company fails to successfully enforce its intellectual property rights, its competitive position could suffer, which could harm its operating results.\nThe Company may also be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police its intellectual property rights. The Company may not be able to detect third-party infringements and its competitive position may be harmed before the Company does so. In addition, competitors may design around the Company\u2019s technology or develop competing technologies. Furthermore, some intellectual property rights are licensed to other companies, allowing them to compete with the Company using that intellectual property.\nThe Company could incur significant costs resulting from complying with, or potential violations of, environmental, health, and human safety laws.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health, and human safety, including those governing the management and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous materials and the cleanup of contamination, and the emission of radio frequency. While the Company believes its operations are in substantial compliance with environmental, health, and human safety laws and regulations, as an owner or operator of property, and in connection with the current and historical use of hazardous materials and other operations at its sites, the Company could incur significant costs resulting from complying with or violations of such laws, the imposition of cleanup obligations, and third-party suits. For instance, a number of the Company\u2019s sites formerly contained underground storage tanks for the storage of used oil and fuel for back-up generators and vehicles.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.", "PERMNO": 47677, "SIC": 4813, "TIC": "CBB"}
