{"cik": "918541", "company": "NN INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nThe following are risk factors that affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, some of which are beyond our control. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the events described below were to actually occur, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be adversely affected, and results could differ materially from expected and historical results.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe depend heavily on a relatively limited number of customers, and the loss of any major customer would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDuring 2019, sales to various U.S. and foreign divisions of our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 52% of our consolidated net sales. The loss of all or a substantial portion of sales to these customers would cause us to lose a substantial portion of our revenue and would lower our operating profit margin and cash flows from operations.\nWork stoppages or similar difficulties and unanticipated business disruptions could significantly disrupt our operations, reduce our revenues and materially affect our earnings.\nA work stoppage at one or more of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Also, if one or more of our customers were to experience a work stoppage, that customer would likely halt or limit purchases of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe have a complex network of suppliers, owned and leased manufacturing locations, co-manufacturing locations, distribution networks, and information systems that support our ability to consistently provide our products to our customers. Factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, such as weather, raw material shortages, natural disasters, fires or explosions, political unrest, terrorism, generalized labor unrest, or health pandemics, such as the new coronavirus that originated in China, could damage or disrupt our operations or our customers\u2019, suppliers\u2019, co-manufacturers\u2019 or distributors\u2019 operations. These disruptions may require additional resources to restore our supply chain or distribution network. If we cannot respond to disruptions in our operations, whether by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations, or if we are unable to quickly repair damage to our information, production, or supply systems, we may be late in delivering, or be unable to deliver, products to our customers and may also be unable to track orders, inventory, receivables, and payables. If that occurs, our customers\u2019 confidence in us and long-term demand for our products could decline. Any of these events could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, our business could be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics, particularly in regions where we have significant operations or concentrations of customers or suppliers. For example, several of our customers and suppliers are located in cities throughout China, and our plant in France relies on suppliers located in Italy. As a result, we could be adversely affected by health epidemics in China and other affected regions, including the recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China, which has subsequently spread around the globe. Consequences of the coronavirus outbreak have included disruptions or restrictions on our ability to travel and temporary closures of our Chinese facilities and the facilities of our customers and suppliers in China and other affected regions. Our operating results could be adversely affected to the extent that the coronavirus outbreak harms the Chinese and global economies in general. Any disruption of our customers or suppliers may also materially adversely affect our business and operating results. In addition, the coronavirus outbreak could evolve into a worldwide health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe operate in and sell products to customers outside the U.S. and are subject to several risks related to doing business internationally.\nWe obtain a majority of our raw materials from overseas suppliers, actively participate in overseas manufacturing operations and sell to a large number of international customers. During the year ended December 31, 2019, sales to customers located outside of the U.S. accounted for approximately 28% of our consolidated net sales. As a result of doing business internationally, we face risks associated with the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in tariff regulations, which may make our products more costly to export or import;\n\u2022\nchanges in monetary and fiscal policies, laws and regulations, and other activities of governments, agencies and similar organizations;\n\u2022\nrecessions or marked declines specific to a particular country or region;\n\u2022\nthe potential imposition of trade restrictions or prohibitions;\n\u2022\nthe potential imposition of import tariffs or other duties or taxes;\n\u2022\ndifficulties establishing and maintaining relationships with local original equipment manufacturers, distributors and dealers;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing geographically diverse operations; and\n\u2022\nunstable governments or legal systems in countries in which our suppliers, manufacturing operations, and customers are located.\nThese and other risks may also increase the relative price of our products compared to those manufactured in other countries, thereby reducing the demand for our products in the markets in which we operate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIn addition, we could be adversely affected by violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, as well as export controls and economic sanction laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal controls and procedures will always protect us from the improper acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA, export control or sanction violations, we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, including loss of export privileges or authorization needed to conduct aspects of our international business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIn addition, the prices we pay for raw materials used in our products may be impacted by tariffs. The tariffs initiated by the U.S. government in 2018 under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 resulted in increased metals prices in the United States. Any future tariffs or quotas imposed on steel and aluminum imports may increase the price of metal, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nFailure of our products could result in a product recall.\nThe majority of our products are components of our customers\u2019 products that are used in critical industrial applications. A failure of our components could lead to a product recall. If a recall were to happen as a result of our components failing, we could bear a substantial part of the cost of correction. In addition to the cost of fixing the parts affected by the component, a recall could result in the loss of a portion of or all of the customer\u2019s business and damage our reputation. A successful product recall claim requiring that we bear a substantial part of the cost of correction or the loss of a key customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur markets are highly competitive, and many of our competitors have significant advantages that could adversely affect our business.\nWe face substantial competition in the sale of components, system subassemblies, and finished devices in the vertical end markets into which we sell our products. Our competitors are continuously exploring and implementing improvements in technology and manufacturing processes in order to improve product quality, and our ability to remain competitive will depend, among other things, on whether we are able to keep pace with such quality improvements in a cost-effective manner. Due to this competitiveness, we may not be able to increase prices for our products to cover cost increases. In many cases we face pressure from our customers to reduce prices, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, our customers may choose to purchase products from one of our competitors rather than pay the prices we seek for our products, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAny loss of key personnel and the inability to attract and retain qualified employees could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nWe are dependent on the continued services of key executives and personnel. The departure of our key personnel without adequate replacement could severely disrupt our business operations. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and manufacturing industry experience to operate our businesses successfully. From time to time, there may be shortages of skilled labor, which may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain qualified employees. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our costs to do so increase significantly, our operations would be materially adversely affected.\nDamage to our reputation could harm our businesses, including our competitive position and business prospects.\nOur ability to attract and retain customers, supplier, investors, and employees is impacted by our reputation. Harm to our reputation can arise from various sources, including employee misconduct, security breaches, unethical behavior, litigation or\nregulatory outcomes. The consequences of damage to our reputation include, among other things, increasing the number of litigation claims and the size of damages asserted or subjecting us to enforcement actions, fines, and penalties, all of which would cause us to incur significant defense related costs and expenses.\nOur strategic review is subject to various risks and uncertainties, may not result in any completed transaction and could disrupt or negatively adversely affect our business.\nIn November 2019, we initiated a strategic review to evaluate a broad range of operational, financial and strategic options to reduce leverage and enhance shareholder value, and we retained external advisors to assist in this effort. The strategic options we are evaluating include further cost savings and cash generation initiatives, capital allocation opportunities, and the sale of part or all of NN, among others. There is no finite timetable for completion of the review, and we can provide no assurance that we will pursue or complete any action or transaction in connection with the review. While the review is ongoing, we are exposed to various risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, the diversion of management\u2019s attention to the review; potential difficulty in retaining and attracting key employees during the review process; foreseen and unforeseen costs and expenses associated with the review and any transaction resulting therefrom; exposure to potential litigation in connection with the review process or any transaction resulting therefrom; speculation regarding any developments related to the review and perceived uncertainties related to our future; and potential negative reactions from the financial markets if we do not complete one or more transactions as a result of the review. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or the price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Compliance\nEnvironmental, health and safety laws and regulations impose substantial costs and limitations on our operations, environmental compliance may be more costly than we expect, and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations concerning matters such as air emissions, wastewater discharges, solid and hazardous waste handling, and disposal and the investigation and remediation of contamination. The risks of substantial costs, liabilities, and limitations on our operations related to compliance with these laws and regulations are an inherent part of our business, and future conditions may develop, arise or be discovered that create substantial environmental compliance or remediation liabilities and costs.\nCompliance with environmental, health, and safety legislation and regulatory requirements may prove to be more limiting and costly than we anticipate. To date, we have committed significant expenditures in our efforts to achieve and maintain compliance with these requirements at our facilities, and we expect that we will continue to make significant expenditures related to such compliance in the future. From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings brought by private parties or governmental authorities with respect to environmental matters, including matters involving alleged noncompliance with or liability under environmental, health and safety laws, property damage or personal injury. New laws and regulations, including those which may relate to emissions of greenhouse gases, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur medical devices are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA and comparable agencies outside the U.S. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of our medical devices. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain marketing clearance for our new products or enhancements or modifications to existing products. If such approval is obtained, it may:\n\u2022\ntake a significant amount of time;\n\u2022\nrequire the expenditure of substantial resources;\n\u2022\ninvolve stringent clinical and pre-clinical testing, as well as increased post-market surveillance;\n\u2022\ninvolve modifications, repairs or replacements of our products; and\n\u2022\nresult in limitations on the proposed uses of our products.\nBoth before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations. We are also subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to determine compliance with the FDA\u2019s requirements, including primarily the quality system regulations and medical device reporting regulations. The results of these inspections can include inspectional observations on FDA\u2019s Form-483, warning letters, or other forms of enforcement. Since 2009, the FDA has significantly increased its oversight of companies subject to its regulations, including medical device companies, by hiring new investigators and stepping up inspections of manufacturing facilities. The FDA has also significantly increased the number of warning letters\nissued to companies. If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could ban such medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order a recall, repair, replacement or refund of such devices, refuse to grant pending pre-market approval applications or require certificates of foreign governments for exports, and/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis, enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices, and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees, or us. The FDA may also recommend prosecution to the Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products.\nForeign governmental regulations have become increasingly stringent and more common, and we may become subject to more rigorous regulation by foreign governmental authorities in the future. Penalties for a company\u2019s non-compliance with foreign governmental regulation could be severe, including revocation or suspension of a company\u2019s business license and criminal sanctions. Any domestic or foreign governmental law or regulation imposed in the future may have a material adverse effect on us.\nChanges in U.S. tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations, and financial condition.\nChanges in U.S. tax laws, tax rulings, or interpretations of existing laws could materially affect our business, cash flow, results of operations, and financial condition. In particular, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive Federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cU.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\u201d). The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 introduces significant changes to U.S. income tax law that have had a meaningful impact on our provision for income taxes. Accounting for the income tax effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 requires significant judgments and estimates in the interpretation and calculations of the provisions of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. As disclosed in Item 9A, management identified certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting during 2019 that remained unremediated as of December 31, 2019. Although we undertook efforts in the current year to remediate the material weakness previously reported in our annual filings related to the control environment, we were unsuccessful in fully remediating such material weakness. Because of the material weaknesses identified, our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. With the oversight of senior management and the audit committee, we have begun taking steps to remediate the underlying cause of the material weaknesses and improve the design of controls. Until remediated, these material weaknesses could result in future misstatements to our financial statements.\nWhile we expect to take the measures necessary to address the underlying causes of these material weaknesses, we cannot at this time estimate how long it will take, and our efforts may not prove to be successful in remediating these material weaknesses. While we have not incurred and do not expect to incur material expenses specifically related to the remediation of these material weaknesses, actual expenses may exceed our current estimates and overall costs of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting may be material.\nIf we are unable to successfully remediate these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, or if we identify any additional material weaknesses that may exist, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected. Our failure to file periodic and certain current reports with the SEC in a timely manner, among other things, could in the future preclude or delay us from being eligible to use a short form registration statement on Form S-3 to register certain sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders and could even result in the suspension of trading of our common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) and/or the revocation of our registration by the SEC. Any of these consequences may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Capitalization\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $793.2 million of indebtedness outstanding and an additional $63.9 million of unused borrowings under our debt agreements. Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry, or competitive developments;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund operations, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under our debt agreements;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product and service development, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage may prevent us from exploiting.\nIf any one of these events were to occur, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. For more information regarding our indebtedness, please see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nDespite our high indebtedness level, we will still be able to incur substantial additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although our debt agreements contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 debt levels, the related risks that we now face could increase.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that will limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur debt agreements contain various incurrence covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These incurrence covenants will limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred equity;\n\u2022\npay dividends on, repurchase, or make distributions in respect of our capital stock, prepay, redeem, or repurchase certain debt or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments and acquisitions;\n\u2022\ncreate certain liens;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends to us;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nalter our existing businesses; and\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates.\nIn addition, the incurrence covenants in our debt agreements require us to meet specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance, which, in turn, will be subject to economic conditions and to financial, market, and competitive factors, many of which are beyond our control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of our debt agreements and permit our lenders to cease making loans to us under our credit facility (as defined below) or to accelerate the maturity date of the indebtedness incurred thereunder. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our secured debt agreements, our secured lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure our borrowings. Such actions by the lenders could also cause cross defaults under our other debt agreements.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, and we may not be able to refinance our debt obligations as they mature.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nWe regularly review our capital structure, various financing alternatives and conditions in the debt and equity markets in order to opportunistically enhance our capital structure. In connection therewith, we may seek to refinance or retire existing indebtedness, incur new or additional indebtedness or issue equity or equity-linked securities, in each case, depending on market and other conditions. As our debt obligations mature or if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of our existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.\nWe have international operations that are subject to foreign economic uncertainties and foreign currency fluctuation.\nApproximately 28% of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies, which may result in additional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange rates and controls on currency exchange. Changes in the value of foreign currencies could increase our U.S. dollar costs for, or reduce our U.S. dollar revenues from, our foreign operations. Any increased costs or reduced revenues as a result of foreign currency fluctuations could affect our profits. In 2019, the U.S. dollar strengthened against foreign currencies which unfavorably affected our revenue by $8.4 million. In contrast, a weakening of the U.S. dollar may beneficially affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations and may decline. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:\n\u2022\nmacro or micro-economic factors;\n\u2022\nour operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators, such as earnings per share, net income and revenues;\n\u2022\nchanges in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports by analysts;\n\u2022\nloss of any member of our senior management team;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructuring;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by stockholders;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions;\n\u2022\ndomestic and international economic, legal, and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022\nloss of a major customer; and\n\u2022\nthe declaration and payment of a dividend.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In addition, due to the market capitalization of our stock, our stock tends to be more volatile than large capitalization stocks that comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Average or Standard and Poor\u2019s 500 Index.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware corporate law, contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control or changes in our management that a stockholder might consider favorable and may prevent shareholders from receiving a takeover premium for their shares. These provisions include, for example, a classified board of directors and the authorization of our board of directors to issue up to five million preferred shares without a stockholder vote. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that stockholders may not call a special meeting.\nWe are a Delaware corporation subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law. Generally, this statute prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which such person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A business combination includes a merger, asset sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the stockholder. We anticipate that the provisions of\nSection 203 may encourage parties interested in acquiring us to negotiate in advance with our board of directors, because the stockholder approval requirement would be avoided if a majority of the directors then in office approve either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder.\nThese provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some of our stockholders. If a change of control or change in management is delayed or prevented, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Related to Acquisitions and Divestitures\nAcquisitions may constitute an important part of our future growth strategy.\nAcquiring businesses that complement or expand our operations has been and may continue to be a key element of our business strategy. We regularly evaluate acquisition transactions, sign non-disclosure agreements, and participate in processes with respect to acquisitions, some of which may be material to us. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in identifying attractive acquisition candidates or completing acquisitions on favorable terms in the future. In addition, we may borrow funds or issue equity to acquire other businesses, increasing our interest expense and debt levels or diluting our existing stockholders\u2019 ownership interest in us. Our inability to acquire businesses, or to operate them profitably once acquired, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Our borrowing agreements limit our ability to complete acquisitions without prior approval of our lenders. We have had difficulty with purchase accounting and other aspects related to the accounting for our acquisitions which resulted in material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Although we have remediated these material weaknesses, there can be no assurances we will not face similar issues with respect to any future acquisitions.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from completed acquisitions or any future strategic portfolio acquisition, or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.\nWe either may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from completed acquisitions or any future strategic portfolio acquisition, or it may take longer to realize such benefits. Achieving those benefits depends on the timely, efficient, and successful execution of a number of post-acquisition events, including integrating the acquired businesses into our existing businesses. The integration process may disrupt the businesses and, if implemented ineffectively, would preclude the realization of the full anticipated benefits. The difficulties of combining the operations of acquired companies include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention to integration matters;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the integration of operations and systems, including, without limitation, the complexities associated with managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company, addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies and the challenge of integrating complex systems, technology, networks, and other assets of each of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities, and growth prospects from combining the acquired businesses with our own;\n\u2022\nthe inability to implement effective internal controls, procedures, and policies for acquired businesses as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 within the time periods prescribed thereby;\n\u2022\nthe exposure to potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nchallenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers;\n\u2022\nchallenges in attracting and retaining key personnel; and\n\u2022\nthe disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, ongoing operations or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies.\nMany of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could materially impact our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAdditionally, we incurred a significant amount of debt in connection with our acquisitions in the past few years. Finally, in relation to such acquisitions, we have significantly higher amounts of intangible assets, including goodwill. These intangible assets will be subject to impairment testing, and we could incur a significant impact to our financial statements in the form of an impairment if assumptions and expectations related to our acquisitions are not realized.\nWe have and will continue to incur expenses related to our acquisitions and the integration of our acquired companies.\nWe have and will continue to incur expenses related to our acquisitions and the integration of our acquired companies. While we have assumed that a certain level of expenses will be incurred, there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses. Moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their\nnature, difficult to estimate accurately. These integration expenses may result in us taking charges against earnings, and the amount of any future charges are uncertain at present.\nWe may be unable to realize the anticipated cost or capital expenditure savings or may incur additional and/or unexpected costs in order to realize them.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to realize the anticipated cost or capital expenditure savings from our acquisitions in the anticipated amounts or within the anticipated timeframes or at all. With respect to each acquisition, we anticipate implementing a series of cost savings initiatives that we expect to result in recurring, annual run-rate cost savings. These or any other cost or capital expenditure savings that we realize may differ materially from our estimates. We cannot provide assurances that these anticipated savings will be achieved or that our programs and improvements will be completed as anticipated or at all. In addition, any cost savings that we realize may be offset, in whole or in part, by reductions in revenues or through increases in other expenses.\nOur projections and assumptions related to cost savings are based on our current estimates, but they involve risks, uncertainties, projections, and other factors that may cause actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements, express or implied. Neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent auditors, have examined, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to these projections, nor have they expressed any opinion, or any other form of assurance on such information or their achievability. Assumptions relating to our projections involve subjective decisions and judgments with respect to, among other things, the estimated impact of certain operational adjustments, including Six Sigma/OpEx optimization programs, product grouping and rationalization, facility rationalization and shared services cost savings, and other cost and savings adjustments, as well as future economic, competitive, industry and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are inherently uncertain and may be beyond the control of our management.\nFailure to realize the expected costs savings and operating synergies related to our acquisitions could result in increased costs and have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur future results could suffer if we cannot effectively manage our expanded operations, which are significantly larger and more complex following our acquisitions.\nAs a result of our acquisitions over the past few years, the size and scope of our operations were significantly increased. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage the expanded operations, which will pose challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. We may not have the expertise, experience and resources to pursue or successfully operate all of our businesses at once. The administration of our businesses requires implementation and oversight of appropriate operations, management, compliance and financial reporting systems and controls. We may experience difficulties in effectively implementing and overseeing these and other systems. Such implementation and initial oversight will require the focused attention of our management team, including a significant commitment of its time and resources. The need for management to focus on these matters could have a material and adverse impact on our revenues and operating results. There can be no assurance that we will be successful or that we will realize any operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements or other benefits currently anticipated from our acquisitions.\nThe indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities.\nCertain of the acquisition agreements from past acquisitions require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of each of their companies before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited in amount and duration and certain former owners may not be able to meet their indemnification responsibilities. These indemnification provisions may not fully protect us, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our profitability and financial position.\nOur participation in joint ventures could expose us to additional risks from time to time.\nWe currently have a 49% investment in a Chinese joint venture and may participate in additional joint ventures from time to time. Our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership, including:\n\u2022\nour joint venture partners could have investment and financing goals that are not consistent with our objectives, including the timing, terms, and strategies for any investments, and what levels of debt to incur or carry;\n\u2022\nwe could experience an impasse on certain decisions because we do not have sole decision-making authority, which could require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes, including litigation or arbitration;\n\u2022\nour ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted and the market for our interest may be limited;\n\u2022\nour joint venture partners might become bankrupt, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfill their obligations as a joint venture partner, which may require us to infuse our own capital into the venture on behalf of the partner despite other competing uses for such capital; and\n\u2022\nour joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues.\nAny divestitures and discontinued operations could negatively impact our business and retained liabilities from businesses that we may sell could adversely affect our financial results.\nAs part of our portfolio management process, we review our operations for businesses which may no longer be aligned with our strategic initiatives and long-term objectives. Divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business, including required separation or carve-out activities and costs, disputes with buyers, or potential impairment charges. We may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less than we had previously anticipated. After reaching an agreement with a buyer for the disposition of a business, we are also subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions, as well as necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms, which may prevent us from completing a transaction. Dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement, as we may be required to retain responsibility for, or agree to indemnify buyers against contingent liabilities related to businesses sold, such as lawsuits, tax liabilities, lease payments, product liability claims, or environmental matters. Under these types of arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect future financial results.", "PERMNO": 80343, "SIC": 3562, "TIC": "NNBR"}
