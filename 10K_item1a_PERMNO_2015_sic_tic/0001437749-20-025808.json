The amendments are intended to reflect the Commission\u2019s commitment to a principles-based, registrant-specific approach to disclosure, rooted in materiality. The modernization of Item 105 Risk Factor Disclosures includes the following:\n\u25cf\nThe requirement for inclusion of a summary risk factor disclosure of no more than two pages if the risk factor section exceeds 15 pages.\n\u25cf\nRefining the principles-based approach by requiring disclosure of \u201cmaterial\u201d risk factors versus \u201cmost significant.\u201d\n\u25cf\nThe requirement to organize risk factors under relevant headings for ease of understanding, with generic risk factors placed at the end of the section. The amendments do not specify the risk factor headings.\nThe Company has reviewed its current risk factors and will organize them under the primary categories of company risk, industry risk, and investor risk.\nSonic Foundry, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nFor the Year Ended September 30, 2020\nRisk Factor Summary Disclosure\nA.\nCompany Risks consist of both internal and external items and events that impact Sonic Foundry as a company. These are further categorized as follows:\n1.\nFinancial Risks impact the financial well-being of the Company. Those risks include, but are not limited to the following:\na.\nWe have a history of losses.\nb.\nWe may need to raise additional capital.\nc.\nIf customer adoption has barriers, our business may not succeed.\nd.\nLarge, multi-unit deals are needed for continued success.\ne.\nBecause most of our service contracts are renewable on an annual basis, a reduction in our service renewal rate could significantly reduce our revenues.\nf.\nIf we are viewed only as a commodity supplier, our margins and valuations will shrink.\ng.\nOur operating results are hard to predict as a significant amount of our sales typically occur at the end of a quarter, and the mix of product and service orders may vary significantly.\nh.\nAccounting regulations and related interpretations and policies, particularly those related to revenue recognition, cause us to defer revenue recognition into future periods for all or portions of our products and services.\ni.\nBecause we generally recognize revenues ratably over the term of our service contracts, a decrease or increase in service transactions will not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods.\nj.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could result in higher costs and decreased margins and earnings.\nk.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.\n2.\nOperational Risks disrupt fundamental daily operations of the Company. Those risks include, but are not limited to the following:\na.\nOperational failures in our network infrastructure could disrupt our remote hosting services, cause us to lose clients and sales to potential clients and result in increased expenses and reduced revenues.\nb.\nOur business is susceptible to risks associated with international operations.\nc.\nSupporting our existing and growing customer base and implementing large customer deployments could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, customer satisfaction and our business will be harmed.\nd.\nIf we lose key personnel or fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully, our ability to manage our business could be impaired.\ne.\nManufacturing disruption or capacity constraints would harm our business.\n3.\nStrategic Risks prevent the Company from achieving its strategic objectives. Those risks include, but are not limited to the following:\na.\nThe technology underlying our products and services is complex and may contain unknown defects that could harm our reputation, result in product liability or decrease market acceptance of our products.\nb.\nOur success depends upon the proprietary aspects of our technology.\nc.\nWe may not be able to innovate to meet the needs of our target market.\nd.\nIf potential customers or competitors use open source software to develop products that are competitive with our products and services, we may face decreased demand and pressure to reduce the prices for our products.\ne.\nWe also rely upon trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, which may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property.\nf.\nIf other parties bring infringement or other claims against us, we may incur significant costs or lose customers.\ng.\nThere is a great deal of competition in the market for our products, which could lower the demand for our products and have a negative impact on our operations.\nh.\nIf our marketing and lead generation efforts are not successful, our business will be harmed.\ni.\nThe length of our sales and deployment cycles are uncertain, which may cause our revenue and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year.\nj.\nWe depend in part on the success of our relationships with third-party resellers and integrators.\nk.\nWe may need to make acquisitions or form strategic alliances or partnerships in order to remain competitive in our market, and acquisitions, strategic alliances or partnerships, could be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business and dilute stockholder value.\nSonic Foundry, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nFor the Year Ended September 30, 2020\n4.\nCompliance Risks result from non-compliance of laws and regulations from various governing bodies. Those risks include, but are not limited to the following:\na.\nOur customers may use our products to share confidential and sensitive information, and if our system security is breached, our reputation could be harmed and we may lose customers.\nb.\nOur business is subject to changing regulations regarding corporate governance and public disclosure that will increase both our costs and the risk of noncompliance.\n5.\nIndustry Risks are items and events that have macro-level impacts on our industries. Those risks include, but are not limited to the following:\na.\nEconomic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company.\nb.\nEconomic conditions may have a disproportionate effect on the sale of our products.\nc.\nWe could lose revenues if there are changes in the spending policies or budget priorities for government funding of colleges, universities, schools and other education providers.\nd.\nChanges in U.S. trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences, may have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\ne.\nPrivacy concerns and laws, evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our solutions and adversely affect our business.\nf.\nWe face risks associated with government regulation of the internet and related legal uncertainties.\n6.\nInvestor Risks are both internal and external risks that impact an investment made in the Company\u2019s stock. Those risks include, but are not limited to the following:\na.\nThe market price of our common stock may be subject to volatility.\nb.\nOur common stock is subject to low trading volume and broad price swings.\nc.\nExercise of outstanding options and warrants will result in further dilution.\nd.\nProvisions of our charter documents and Maryland law could also discourage an acquisition of our Company that would benefit our stockholders and, due to our insiders control of a substantial percentage of our stock, our officers, directors, and major stockholders will have a substantial amount of control over whether to approve or disapprove of a transaction.\nFollowing is a more detailed discussion of each risk factor outlined in the summary.\nCompany Risks - Financial\nWe have a history of losses.\nOur operations have generated losses in most years. Although we were able to maintain flat revenues in fiscal year 2020 and reduce expenses, we still generated a loss for the year. While we continue to work towards profitability and growth, we may not realize sufficient revenues or be able to sustain cost reductions to reach that goal. We initiated a plan for reducing costs in fiscal 2019 that began with eliminating certain headcount and functions, including a reduction in senior executive positions. In 2020, we continued that focus on cost reduction and also executed on an executive leadership change in the fourth quarter of 2020. In that same quarter, we eliminated three additional mid to senior level sales and marketing positions, and in the first quarter of 2021, eliminated additional headcount, primarily within sales and marketing. To achieve profitability and growth, we may need to change certain aspects of our business model. As such, we face risks, expenses and uncertainties related to our specific business model, as well as those typically encountered by similar companies. Those risks include, but are not limited to our ability to successfully achieve the following:\n\u25cf\nManage the growth and profitability of our business, including known and unknown challenges and expenses;\n\u25cf\nAcquire new customers and retain and expand existing customers;\n\u25cf\nDevelop new and complimentary price competitive product and service offerings, both internally and in partnership with third parties;\n\u25cf\nMaintain and develop relationships with strategic partners including dealers, A/V integrators, large institutional end-users, and other channel partners;\nSonic Foundry, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nFor the Year Ended September 30, 2020\n\u25cf\nCompete successfully with companies offering similar products and services;\n\u25cf\nDevelop targeted marketing efforts to expand our reach into new markets and deepen penetration into existing markets;\n\u25cf\nManage and scale a high-performance technology infrastructure;\n\u25cf\nEnsure a highly secure and reliable product platform;\n\u25cf\nAttract and retain highly skilled personnel to execute in a fast-paced, rapidly changing environment;\n\u25cf\nNavigate the ongoing evolution of changing regulatory requirements, such as privacy laws and tax laws, and how it impacts our business, including our products and services; and\n\u25cf\nExpand our competitive reach into international markets.\nWe have experienced some of these risks already and will continue to encounter them as the business evolves. Failure to successfully manage them could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need to raise additional capital.\nAt September 30, 2020, we had cash of $7.6 million, $2.3 million of which was in our foreign operations compared to total cash of $4.3 million and foreign operations cash of $1.3 million at September 30, 2019. We no longer have a revolving credit facility for any financing needs beyond our available cash and cash generated from operations, and, there can be no assurances a revolving facility will be available. The Company has a history of losses and has historically financed its operations primarily through cash from sales of equity or debt securities, and to a limited extent, cash from operations and through credit facilities. The Company was able to maintain prior year revenue levels despite the impacts of COVID-19 and reduce operating expenses as planned to reach positive adjusted EBITDA. We cannot ensure that revenue will continue to grow given the reduction in operating expenses. If revenue is determined to be growing at a rate less than anticipated and expenses are not sufficiently reduced, our cash resources may not be sufficient to support working capital needs, and we may have to attempt to borrow additional funds from other debt providers or attempt to raise equity capital. In addition, our financial condition may, in the future, cause us to be in non-compliance with certain provisions of any debt facilities we may establish.\nIn the event we need to borrow additional money or raise additional equity capital, we may not be able to do so on acceptable terms and conditions. In that event, we may seek to raise money from entities that are affiliated with the Company, as we have done in the past. However, investors may require that their investment be in the form of convertible preferred stock or convertible debt, which will dilute the interests of our existing stockholders. The Company may need to rely on its Chairman, Mark Burish, (\"Mr. Burish\") to provide capital on terms reasonable and acceptable to the independent members of the Board of Directors. There is no assurance, however, that Mr. Burish, or any other affiliated party, will be willing to provide additional capital..\nDuring fiscal year 2020, the Company entered into a debt conversion agreement with Mr. Burish to convert all outstanding debt owed to Mr. Burish into common stock at a conversion price of $5.00 per share. The total debt amount, including accrued interest and fees of $5.6 million, was converted into 1,114,723 shares of common stock. No cash was exchanged in the transaction, however, the elimination of debt improves our working capital as payments of $100 thousand plus interest beginning in August 2020 have now been eliminated.\nAs a result of the non-cash goodwill and other intangible assets impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2018, the Company was no longer able to satisfy the NASDAQ requirement to maintain $2.5 million of stockholders' equity. On December 18, 2018, the Board of Directors approved the voluntary transfer of its common stock from the NASDAQ Stock Exchange to the OTCQB Market (\"the \"QTCQB\"). The OTCQB Market is operated by OTC Markets Group, a centralized electronic quotation service for over-the-counter-securities. The Company ceased trading on NASDAQ at the close of business on December 28, 2018 and began trading on the OTCQB on December 31, 2018 under its current trading symbol \"SOFO\". The Company ceased trading on the OTCQB at the close of business on February 15, 2019 and began trading on the OTC Pink Sheets on February 18, 2019 under its current trading symbol \"SOFO\". The Company has remained a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, notwithstanding its voluntary withdrawal from the NASDAQ. As a result of the Company's inability to satisfy the NASDAQ requirements, its ability to raise equity capital may be adversely affected.\nIn the event we are able to borrow money, we may incur significant interest charges, which could harm our profitability. Holders of debt would also have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock. In the event we are able to raise additional equity, the terms of such financing may dilute the ownership interests of current investors and cause our stock price to fall significantly. In the event additional capital is provided by executive officers or directors, then, due to the low price levels of our common stock, control by such executive officers or directors may substantially increase.\nWe may not be able to secure debt or equity financing upon acceptable terms, if at all. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be negatively impacted. The Company believes its cash position is adequate to accomplish its business plan through at least the next twelve months.\nIf the funds held by our foreign subsidiaries are needed for our operations in the United States, the repatriation of some of these funds to the United States could require payment of additional U.S. taxes.\nSonic Foundry, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nFor the Year Ended September 30, 2020\nIf customer adoption has barriers, our business may not succeed.\nPart of our strategic challenge is to convince enterprise customers of the stability, productivity, improved communications, cost savings, suitability and other benefits of our products. The market for content delivery solutions is very complex, includes many products and solutions that address various aspects of customer needs and as a result it is often difficult for customers and channel partners to understand how our products and services compare. Further, corporate customers may use video as a tool, but may choose to rely upon their own IT infrastructure and resources to manage their video content. Because many companies generally are predisposed to maintaining control of their IT systems and infrastructure, there may be resistance to using software as a service provided by a third party. Our future revenue and revenue growth rates will depend in large part on our success in delivering these products effectively, creating market acceptance for these products in existing markets that we sell into and in new markets, and meeting customer\u2019s needs for new or enhanced products. If we fail to do so, our products will not achieve widespread market acceptance, or will no longer be used by our customers, and we may not generate sufficient revenue to offset our product development and selling and marketing costs, which will adversely impact the valuation of the Company, the price of our stock, and will harm our business.\nLarge, multi-unit deals are needed for continued success.\nWe need to sell multiple units to educational, corporate and government institutions in order to sell most efficiently and become profitable. Sales of multiple units to corporate customers have lagged behind results achieved in the higher education market; consequently, we have allocated more resources to the higher education market. While we have addressed a strategy to leverage existing customers, better address the needs of potential new customers, and close multiple unit transactions, a customer may choose not to make expected purchases of our products. Despite our strategy to focus on a customer base with a recurring need to purchase our products and services, we need to identify and sell more products and services to new customers, enter new markets and reduce the rate of attrition from certain existing customers, typically those with smaller deployments. The failure to develop effective strategies to enter new markets, and increase sales will adversely impact the valuation of the Company and the price of our stock, and will harm our business.\nBecause most of our service contracts are renewable on an annual basis, a reduction in our service renewal rate could significantly reduce our revenues.\nOur clients have no obligation to renew their content hosting agreements, customer support contracts or other annual service contracts after the expiration of the initial period, which is typically one year, and some clients have elected not to do so. A decline in renewal rates could cause our revenues to decline. Our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including client dissatisfaction with our products and services, our slow response to customer technical inquiries, our failure to update our products to maintain their attractiveness in the market, deteriorating economic conditions or budgetary constraints or changes in budget priorities faced by our clients. If our retention rates decrease, we may need to provide more incentives, reduce pricing or increase marketing costs to improve lead generation through marketing in order to increase revenues, all of which could reduce profitability.\nIf we are viewed only as a commodity supplier, our margins and valuations will shrink.\nWe need to provide value-added services in order to avoid being viewed as a commodity supplier, which could adversely impact the valuation of the Company, and the price of our stock. This entails building long-term customer relationships and developing features that will distinguish our products. Our technology is complex and is often confused with other products and technologies in the market place, including video conferencing, streaming and collaboration.\nWe have developed lower cost hardware, software products and cloud solutions to better address the more cost-conscious customers. Such products have more limited features compared to our existing products. While we believe we can preserve the market for our full-featured products due to differentiation between the two and migration to full featured products, release of lower cost products has and could continue to reduce gross margins and demand for products sold at higher prices, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Potential large-scale deployments of our products often include the lower cost products we sell, putting greater pressure on gross margin due to expectations for greater volume discounts.\nIf we fail to build long-term customer relationships, develop features that distinguish our products in the market place and address the market for lower function and cost solutions, our margins will shrink, and our stock may be adversely impacted.\nOur operating results are hard to predict as a significant amount of our sales typically occur at the end of a quarter and the mix of product and service orders may vary significantly.\nRevenue for any particular quarter is extremely difficult to predict with any degree of certainty. We typically ship products within a short time after we receive an order and therefore, we do not have an order backlog with which to estimate future revenue. Any decline or uncertainty in end-user demand could negatively impact end-user orders. Accordingly, our expectations for both short and long-term future revenue is based almost exclusively on our own estimate of future demand based on history and the pipeline of sales opportunities we manage, rather than on firm orders. The mix of product demand varies significantly from quarter to quarter, further complicating our estimated product needs. Our expense and inventory levels are based largely on these estimates. In addition, our events business is particularly unpredictable and subject to variation due to the short time-frame between when we learn of an opportunity and when the event occurs. Further, the majority of our product orders are received in the last month of a quarter; thus, the unpredictability of the receipt of these orders could negatively impact our future results. Accordingly, any significant shortfall in demand for our products or services in relation to our expectations, even if the result was a short-term delay in orders, would have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nSonic Foundry, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nFor the Year Ended September 30, 2020\nWe have experienced growing demand for our hosting and event services as well as a growing preference from our customers in purchasing our annually licensed software. As a result, we have seen an increase in service billings and recurring revenue as a percentage of total billings, and a decrease in hardware billings. We expect this trend to continue, which we expect to help improve predictability of revenue and gross margins but will delay the impact on revenue of any increase or decrease in billings during any particular quarter. We subcontract for some services required by our events customers, such as onsite management labor and closed captioning. We typically charge for such services at a lower margin than other services. The percentage of billings represented by services, provided either directly or indirectly, is also likely to fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to seasonality of event services and other factors. Since content hosting and support services are typically billed in advance of providing the service, revenue is initially deferred, leading to reduced current period revenue with a corresponding negative impact to profits or losses in periods of significant increase in the percentage of our billings for deferred services.\nAccounting regulations and related interpretations and policies, particularly those related to revenue recognition, cause us to defer revenue recognition into future periods for all or portions of our products and services.\nRevenue recognition for our products and services is complex and subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance, some of which are new, as well as, varied interpretations and implementation practices for such rules. These rules require us to apply judgment in determining revenue recognition. In certain situations, we may have to defer the entire amount of revenue from a transaction, even when the product has already shipped. This may occur when the customer has delayed payment on the transaction, or in certain other circumstances, such as when we agree to extend payment terms on other invoices from such customer. In addition, we always defer revenue when services are included in a transaction, and not performed. Other factors that are considered in revenue recognition include those such as standalone selling price (SSP), best estimate of selling price and the inclusion of other services and contingencies to payment terms. We expect that we will continue to defer portions or, in certain circumstances with respect to a particular customer, all of our product or service billings because of these factors, and to the extent that management\u2019s judgment is incorrect it could result in an increase in the amount of revenue deferred in any one period. The amounts deferred may be significant and may vary from quarter to quarter depending on, among other factors, compliance with payment terms, the mix of products sold, combination of products and services sold together or contractual terms.\nAdditional changes in authoritative guidance, including the interpretation of \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\", or changes in practice in applying such rules could also cause us to defer the recognition of revenue to future periods or recognize lower revenue. See Note 1 - Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\nBecause we generally recognize revenues ratably over the term of our service contracts, decrease or increase in service transactions will not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods.\nWe recognize most of our revenues from service contracts monthly over the terms of their agreements, which are typically 12 months, although terms have ranged from less than one month to 48 months. As a result, much of the service revenue we report in each quarter is attributable to agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in sales, client renewals or market acceptance of our products in any one quarter will not necessarily be fully reflected in the revenues in that quarter and will negatively affect our revenues and profitability in future quarters. This ratable revenue recognition also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenues through additional sales in any period, as revenues from new clients must be recognized over the applicable agreement term.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could result in higher costs and decreased margins and earnings.\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries in the Netherlands is the Euro and in Japan is the Japanese Yen. They are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. The conversion rate of the Yen to the US Dollar varied from about 105 to approximately 109 during fiscal 2020. Similarly, the Euro varied from about 0.85 to approximately 0.92 to the US Dollar during fiscal 2020. The strength of the dollar impacts our ability to export profitably to other countries, and will likely continue to fluctuate. Any increase in the exchange rate of the US Dollar compared to the Euro or the Japanese Yen will impact our future operating results and financial position.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.\nThe use of our net operating loss carryforwards may have limitations resulting from certain future ownership changes or other factors under the Internal Revenue Code and other taxing authorities. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 changed both the federal deferred tax value of the net operating loss carryforwards and the rules of utilization of federal net operating loss carryforwards. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective for our 2018 fiscal year. For net operating loss carryforwards generated in years prior to 2018, there is no annual limitation on the utilization and the carryforward period remains at 20 years. There could be a limitation if a change in ownership occurs. However, net operating loss carryforwards generated in years after 2017 will only be available to offset 80% of future taxable income in any single year, but will not expire.\nSonic Foundry, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nFor the Year Ended September 30, 2020\nIf our net operating loss carryforwards are limited, and we have taxable income which exceeds the available net operating loss carryforwards for that period, we would incur an income tax liability even though net operating loss carryforwards may be available in future years prior to their expiration. Any such income tax liability may adversely affect our future cash flow, financial position and financial results.\nCompany Risks - Operational\nOperational failures in our network infrastructure could disrupt our remote hosting services, cause us to lose clients and sales to potential clients and result in increased expenses and reduced revenues.\nUnanticipated problems affecting our network systems could cause interruptions or delays in the delivery of the hosting services we provide to some of our clients. We are not equipped to provide full disaster recovery to all of our hosted clients. If there are operational failures in our network infrastructure that cause interruptions, slower response times, loss of data or extended loss of service for our remotely hosted clients, we may be required to issue credits or pay penalties, current clients may terminate their contracts or elect not to renew them and we may lose sales to potential clients. We have recently acquired additional hardware and systems, expect to make more significant investments in hardware and outsourced most aspects of our network infrastructure to multiple providers. We also rely on Internet systems and infrastructure to operate our business and provide our services. As a result, we are reliant on third parties for network availability, so outages may be outside our control and we may need to acquire additional hardware in order to provide an appropriate level of redundancy required by our customers. These hardware, data, and cloud computing platforms may not be available at reasonable terms or prices.\nOur business is susceptible to risks associated with international operations.\nInternational product and service billings were 36% of our total billings in each of the past two years and are expected to continue to account for a significant portion of our business in the future. International sales are subject to a variety of risks, including:\n\u25cf\nDifficulties in establishing and managing international subsidiaries, distribution channels and operations;\n\u25cf\nDifficulties in selling, servicing and supporting overseas products, translating products into foreign languages and compliance with local hardware requirements;\n\u25cf\nDifficulties in managing the demands of large international deployments, many of which distract key sales personnel from opportunities in other parts of the world;\n\u25cf\nChallenges associated with management transition;\n\u25cf\nChallenges related to language or cultural differences;\n\u25cf\nThe uncertainty of laws and enforcement in certain countries, such as China, relating to the protection of intellectual property or requirements for product certification, protection of personal data or other restrictions;\n\u25cf\nCompetitive pressure impacting other parts of the world;\n\u25cf\nMultiple and possibly overlapping tax structures;\n\u25cf\nCurrency and exchange rate fluctuations and imposition of tariffs or quotas;\n\u25cf\nDifficulties in collecting accounts receivable in foreign countries, including complexities in documenting letters of credit;\n\u25cf\nEconomic or political changes in international markets;\n\u25cf\nRestrictions on access to the Internet; and\n\u25cf\nDifficulty in complying with international employment related requirements\nSupporting our existing and growing customer base and implementing large customer deployments could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, customer satisfaction and our business will be harmed.\nFrequent enhancements to our software puts pressure on our customers to install, maintain and train their personnel on its use. Further, frequent releases of the software can lead to less product stability. As a result, our customer care and engineering resources have come under, and are expected in the future to come under significant pressure in providing the high-quality of technical support our customers expect during periods of high demand. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. Increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our products and services to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results and financial position.\nAs we target more of our sales efforts at larger initial transactions, we face increasingly complex deployments requiring substantial technical and management resources, including in some cases significant product customization and integration with other applications or hardware. Customers making large expenditures for our products and services typically have higher expectations of product and service operability and response time if issues arise. Some of these customers have asked us to host their content and have significant amounts of legacy content to transfer to our datacenter. Such increased activity and storage demand on our data centers put additional strain on our personnel and hosting infrastructure. Our hosting customers typically require a high level of access, data security and need to capture and store multiple high definition streams. Such requirements require costly enhancements to our infrastructure. If we do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements and we experience significant strains on our data center capacity, our customers could experience performance degradation or service outages that may subject us to financial penalties, result in customer losses and harm our business. As we add or change data centers or capacity, we may move or transfer our data and our customers\u2019 data. Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services, which may damage our business. High demand on technical and management resources to manage large transactions distract personnel from existing customers, development of new products and other important activities which could lead to potential customer dissatisfaction, product development delays or other issues associated with the distraction.\nSonic Foundry, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nFor the Year Ended September 30, 2020\nIf a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation and delay recognition of revenue, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customer\u2019s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. In addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers.\nIf we lose key personnel or fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully, our ability to manage our business could be impaired.\nOur future success depends upon the continued service of our key management, technical, sales and other critical personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer. Most of our officers and other key personnel are employees-at-will, and we cannot assure that we will be able to retain them. Key personnel have left our Company in the past, sometimes to accept employment with companies that sell similar products or services to existing or potential customers of ours. The technology industry is subject to substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and Internet-related services, as well as competition for sales and operations personnel. There will likely be additional departures of key personnel from time to time in the future and such departures could result in additional competition, loss of customers or confusion in the marketplace. As we seek to replace such departures, or expand our business, the hiring of qualified sales, technical and support personnel is difficult due to the limited number of qualified professionals. Training of new sales, technical and support personnel can take six months or longer before they become productive. Sales and technical strategies have changed and will likely change further in the future and require different skills to sell to different customer types and develop new and changing products. The loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations, including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases, the successful implementation and completion of Company initiatives and the results of our operations. In addition, we do not have life insurance policies on any of our key employees. If we lose the services of any of our key employees, the integration of replacement personnel could be time consuming, may cause disruptions to our operations and may be unsuccessful.\nManufacturing disruption or capacity constraints would harm our business.\nWe subcontract the manufacturing of our recorders to a third-party contract manufacturer. Although we believe there are multiple sources of supply from other contract manufacturers, as well as, multiple suppliers of component parts required by our contract manufacturer, a disruption of supply of component parts or completed products, even if short term, would have a material negative impact on our revenues. Likewise, we are susceptible to any material change in terms; such as pricing, level of services performed or changes to payment terms by our contract manufacturer. In particular, the cost of our products increased this year as a result of tariffs imposed by China. Many component parts currently have long delivery lead times or cease production of certain components with limited notice in which to evaluate or obtain alternate supply, requiring conservative estimation of production requirements. Lengthening lead times, product design changes and other third-party manufacturing disruptions have caused delays in delivery in the past. In order to compensate for supply delays, we have sourced components from off-shore locations, used cross component parts, paid significantly higher prices or premium fees to expedite delivery for short supply components and converted inventory from one version to another. We have typically maintained greater amounts of inventory as insurance against delays but currently hold substantially lower quantities of inventory in order to improve liquidity. Many of these strategies have increased our costs or require substantial resources to maintain and may not be sufficient to ensure against a product shortage. We depend on our subcontract manufacturer to produce our products efficiently while maintaining high levels of quality despite frequent changes in configuration and scheduling imposed by us. Any manufacturing or component defects, delay in production or changes in product features will likely cause customer dissatisfaction and may harm our reputation. Moreover, any incapacitation of the manufacturing site due to destruction, natural disaster or similar events could result in a loss of product inventory. As a result of any of the foregoing, we may not be able to meet demand for our products, which could negatively affect revenues in the quarter of the disruption or longer depending upon the magnitude of the event, and could harm our reputation.\nWe license technology from third parties. If we are unable to maintain these licenses, our operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted.\nWe license technology from third parties. The loss of, our inability to maintain, or changes in material terms of these licenses could result in increased cost or delayed sales of our software, and services, or may cause us to remove features from our products or services. We anticipate that we will continue to license technology from third parties in the future. This technology may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Although we do not believe that we are substantially dependent on any individual licensed technology, some of the component technologies that we license from third parties could be difficult for us to replace. The impairment of these third-party relationships, especially if this impairment were to occur in unison, could result in delays in the delivery of our software and services until equivalent technology, if available, is identified, licensed and integrated. This delay could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nSonic Foundry, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nFor the Year Ended September 30, 2020\nCompany Risks - Strategic\nThe technology underlying our products and services is complex and may contain unknown defects that could harm our reputation, result in product liability or decrease market acceptance of our products.\nThe technology underlying our products is complex and includes software that is internally developed, software licensed from third parties and hardware purchased from third parties. These products have, and will in the future, contain errors or defects, particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We may not discover defects that affect our current or new applications or enhancements until after they are sold, and our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover our exposure. Further, there are third-party applications our products and services are dependent on, or integrate with, such as operating systems and learning management systems. These integrations require specialized knowledge that is difficult and expensive to maintain. Failure to maintain compatibility with such applications or identification of defects in our products and services could:\n\u25cf\nDamage our reputation;\n\u25cf\nCause our customers to initiate product liability suits against us;\n\u25cf\nIncrease our product development resources;\n\u25cf\nCause customers to cancel orders, ask for partial refunds or potential customers to purchase competitive products or services;\n\u25cf\nDelay release or market acceptance of our products, or otherwise adversely impact our relationships with our customers; and/or\n\u25cf\nCause us to allocate valuable engineering resources to fix our existing products, which may cause us to allocate fewer resources toward developing new products, or toward adding features to our existing products.\nOur success depends upon the proprietary aspects of our technology.\nOur success and ability to compete depend to a significant degree upon the protection of our proprietary technology. We currently have three U.S. patents that have been issued to us. We may seek additional patents in the future. However, it is possible that:\n\u25cf \ufeffAny patents acquired by or issued to us may not be broad enough to protect us.\n\u25cf Any issued patent could be successfully challenged by one or more third parties, which could result in our loss of the right to prevent others from exploiting the inventions claimed in those patents.\n\u25cf Current and future competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our services or design around any of our patents.\n\u25cf Effective patent protection, including effective legal-enforcement mechanisms against those who violate our patent-related assets, may not be available in every country in which we do or plan to do business.\n\u25cf We may not have the resources to enforce our patents or may determine the potential benefits are not worth the cost and risk of ultimately being unsuccessful.\nWe may not be able to innovate to meet the needs of our target markets.\nOur future success will continue to depend upon our ability to create an effective development product strategy, to develop new products, product enhancements and service offerings that address future needs of our existingtarget markets and enable us to expand the market for our products and service offerings. Our success is also dependent upon our ability to respond to changing standards and practices on a timely basis, particulary as customers move away from hardware to software solutions. The success of new strategies, products, product enhancements and service offerings depends on several factors, including timely completion, quality and stability, and market acceptance. Our fiscal 2021 business plan includes an expectation for revenue contribution from both new and existing customers associated with the introduction of lower priced hardware and software products in locations that can\u2019t support our more comprehensive solutions. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving our revenue expectations from these new products or that we are able to retain existing customers with our more comprehensive solutions. Our revenue could be adversely impacted if we do not capitalize on opportunities to develop innovative new products, product enhancements and service offerings that will increase the likelihood that our products and services will be accepted in preference to the products and services of our current and future competitors. Some of our prospective customers may delay the purchase of our products or services until certain features are completed, may require custom development of certain features as part of the purchase decision, or may condition additional payments tied to completion of such features. Prioritizing such custom features can be difficult to adapt to other customers and distracts our engineering team from implementing features required by other customers.\nIf potential customers or competitors use open source software to develop products that are competitive with our products and services, we may face decreased demand and pressure to reduce the prices for our products.\nThe growing acceptance and prevalence of open source software may make it easier for competitors or potential competitors to develop software applications that compete with our products, or for customers and potential customers to internally develop software applications that they would otherwise have licensed from us. One of the aspects of open source software is that it can be modified or used to develop new software that competes with proprietary software applications, such as ours. Such competition can develop without the degree of overhead and lead time required by traditional proprietary software companies. As open source offerings become more prevalent, customers may defer or forego purchases of our products, which could reduce our sales and lengthen the sales cycle for our products or result in the loss of current customers to open source solutions. If we are unable to differentiate our products from competitive products based on open source software, demand for our products and services may decline, and we may face pressure to reduce the prices of our products, which would hurt our profitability. If our use of open-source is challenged and construes unfavorably, our operating results could be adversely impacted.\nSonic Foundry, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nFor the Year Ended September 30, 2020\nWe use open source software in our application suite. Although we monitor our use of open source software closely, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by United States courts, and there is risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. In such event, we could be required to re-engineer our technology or to discontinue offering all or a portion of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe also rely upon trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, which may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property.\nWe also rely on a combination of laws, such as copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality agreements and licenses, to establish and protect our technology. We have registered three U.S. and four foreign country trademarks. These forms of intellectual property protection are critically important to our ability to establish and maintain our competitive position. However, it is possible that:\n\u25cf\nThird parties may infringe or misappropriate our copyrights, trademarks and similar proprietary rights.\n\u25cf\nLaws and contractual restrictions may not be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology or to deter others from developing similar technologies, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully or as readily as Unites States laws.\n\u25cf\nThere have been attacks on certain patent systems, increasing the likelihood of changes to established laws, including in the United States. We cannot predict the long-term effects of any potential changes, which could be detrimental to our licensing program.\n\u25cf\nEffective trademark, copyright and trade secret protection, including effective legal-enforcement mechanisms against those who violate our trademark, copyright or trade secret assets, may be cost prohibitive or unavailable or limited in foreign countries.\n\u25cf\nContractual agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information.\n\u25cf\nOther companies may claim common law trademark rights based upon state or foreign laws that precede the federal registration of our marks.\n\u25cf\nPolicing unauthorized use of our services and trademarks is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and we may be unable to determine the extent of any unauthorized use.\n\u25cf\nReverse engineering, unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it, which would significantly harm our business.\nIf other parties bring infringement or other claims against us, we may incur significant costs or lose customers.\nOther companies may obtain patents or other proprietary rights that would limit our ability to conduct our business and could assert that our technologies infringe their proprietary rights. We have incurred substantial costs to defend against such claims in the past and could incur legal costs in the future, even if without merit, and intellectual property litigation could force us to cease using key technology, obtain a license or redesign our products. In the course of our business, we may sell certain systems to our customers, and in connection with such sale, we may agree to indemnify these customers from claims made against them by third parties for patent infringement related to these systems, which could harm our business.\nThere is a great deal of competition in the market for our products, which could lower the demand for our products and have a negative impact on our operations.\nThe market for our products and services is intensely competitive, dynamic and subject to rapid technological change. The intensity of the competition and the pace of change are expected to increase in the future, and likely will require the Company to compete on price and our offerings more than in the past, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Increased competition has reduced gross margins, has resulted in new customer losses and may result in loss of market share, any one of which could seriously harm our business. Competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services offered, many of which have greater financial resources, greater name recognition, more employees and greater financial, technical, marketing, public relations and distribution resources than we have. In addition, new competitors with greater financial resources may arise through partnerships, distribution agreements, mergers, acquisitions or other types of transactions at any time. In particular, large companies have begun to make investments in and/or partner with smaller companies to enter the lecture capture and video management markets.\nVarious vendors provide lecture capture, enterprise webcasting or video content management capabilities, but few offer an end-to-end solution that addresses all phases of the video content lifecycle (capture, delivery, transformation and management) in a single platform like Mediasite.\nSonic Foundry, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nFor the Year Ended September 30, 2020\nLecture capture solutions designed specifically for higher education differ in their technology approach.\n\u25cf\nAppliance- or room-based lecture capture provides a fully integrated system with complete recording automation for live or on-demand content. The automated, pre-scheduled workflow results in the greatest faculty and staff adoption and largest volumes of recorded content in the shortest amount of time.\n\u25cf\nSoftware-based lecture capture that resides on a podium or computer in the classroom also captures and publishes rich media content, but relies on campus- or user-supplied hardware.\n\u25cf\nDesktop capture tools reside on individual users\u2019 laptops or computers allowing them to record user-generated content.\nFew lecture capture vendors offer a mix of all lecture capture approaches to best suit customers\u2019 needs. Most vendors, including Extron and Panopto, support only one approach to lecture capture. Likewise, a very small number of vendors provide an integrated platform like Mediasite to archive and manage video and rich media recorded with their solution. Most rely on a third-party platform, typically the institution\u2019s learning or course management system, to publish, search and secure content.\nEnterprise video management solutions serve as centralized media repositories that facilitate the delivery, publishing and management of on-demand video. Unlike Mediasite, most platforms do not include a video capture, webcasting or live streaming component, but instead ingest or import video-based content captured by other third-party devices or solutions. Also, most other platforms focus on ingesting video-only content rather than rich video which combines multiple synchronous video and/or slide streams into an interactive media experience.\nSome current and potential customers develop their own home-grown lecture capture, webcasting or video content solutions which may also compete with Mediasite. However, we often find many of these organizations are now looking for a commercial solution that offers comprehensive management capabilities, requires fewer resources and internal maintenance and delivers a less cumbersome workflow.\nThe competitive environment has required us to make changes in our products, pricing, licensing, services, or marketing to maintain and extend our current technology. Price concessions or the emergence of other pricing, licensing, and distribution strategies or technology solutions of competitors has impacted revenue growth and may in the future further reduce our revenue, margins or market share. Other changes we have to make in response to competition, such as our desktop user intergace, could cause us to expend significant financial and other resources, disrupt our operations, strain relationships with partners, release products and enhancements before they are thoroughly tested or result in customer dissatisfaction, any of which could harm our operating results and stock price.\nIf our marketing and lead generation efforts are not successful, our business will be harmed.\nWe believe that continued marketing efforts will be critical to achieve widespread acceptance of our products. Our marketing strategies and campaigns may not be successful, and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to cover the expenses required to implement effective strategies and campaigns. For example, failure to adequately generate and develop qualified sales leads could cause our future revenue to decrease. In addition, our inability to generate and cultivate qualified sales leads into large organizations, where there is the potential for significant use of our products, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may not be able to identify and secure the number of strategic qualified sales leads necessary to help generate marketplace acceptance of our products. If our marketing or lead-generation efforts are not successful, our business and operating results will be harmed.\nThe length of our sales and deployment cycles are uncertain, which may cause our revenue and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year.\nDuring our sales cycle, we spend considerable time and expense providing information to prospective customers about the use and benefits of our products without generating corresponding revenue. Our expense levels are relatively fixed in the short-term and based in part on our expectations of future revenue. Therefore, any delay in our sales cycle could cause significant variations in our operating results, particularly because a relatively small number of customer orders represent a large portion of our revenue.\nOur largest potential sources of revenue are educational institutions, large corporations and government entities that often require long testing and approval processes before making a decision to purchase our products, particularly when evaluating our products for inclusion in new buildings under construction, high dollar transactions or competitive bids. In general, the process of selling our products to a potential customer may involve lengthy negotiations, collaborations with consultants, designers and architects, time consuming installation processes and changes in network infrastructure in excess of what we or our VARs are able to provide. In addition, educational institutions that started with small pilots are committing to more complex installations and expanding to include undergraduate classrooms, which, due to the increased size of these types of transactions, typically require a longer sales cycle. Also, our enterprise accounts are less motivated by seasonal sales and promotions, and therefore are frequently difficult to finalize. As a result of these factors, our sales and deployment cycles are unpredictable. Our sales and deployment cycles are also subject to delays as a result of customer-specific factors over which we have little or no control, including budgetary constraints, existing infrastructure technical issues and internal approval procedures, particularly with customers or potential customers that rely on government funding.\nOur products are aimed toward a broadened user base within our key markets and these products are relatively early in their product life cycles. We cannot predict how the market for our products will develop, and part of our strategic challenge will be to convince targeted users of the productivity, improved communications and test scores, cost savings and other benefits. Accordingly, it is likely that delays in our sales cycles with these products will occur and this could cause significant variations in our operating results.\nSonic Foundry, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nFor the Year Ended September 30, 2020\nSales of some of our products have experienced seasonal fluctuations which have affected sequential growth rates for these products, particularly in our first fiscal quarter. For example, there is generally a slowdown for sales of our products in the higher education and corporate markets in the first fiscal quarter of each year. Seasonal fluctuations could negatively affect our business, which could cause our operating results to fall short of anticipated results for such quarters. As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.\nWe depend in part on the success of our relationships with third-party resellers and integrators.\nOur success depends on various third-party relationships, particularly in our non-higher education business, with certain international geographies and our events services operations. The relationships include third party resellers, as well as, system integrators that assist with implementations of our products and sourcing of our products and services. Identifying partners, negotiating and documenting relationships with them and maintaining their relationships require significant time and resources from us. In addition, our agreements with our resellers and integrators are typically non-exclusive and do not prohibit them from working with our competitors or from offering competing products or services. We have limited control, if any, as to whether these strategic partners devote adequate resources to promoting, selling and implementing our products as compared to our competitor\u2019s products. Our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to third parties to favor their products or services. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with these third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to maintain or grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating results would suffer.\nWe may need to make acquisitions or form strategic alliances or partnerships in order to remain competitive in our market, and recent acquisitions, strategic alliances or partnerships, including the acquisition of Mediasite KK and Sonic Foundry International, could be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business and dilute stockholder value.\nWe completed the acquisitions of Mediasite KK in Japan and MediaMission (now Sonic Foundry International) in the Netherlands in fiscal 2014. As a result of these acquisitions, we must integrate our products, services, dispersed operations, management systems and very different cultures. In the future, we may acquire or form strategic alliances or partnerships with other businesses in order to remain competitive or to acquire new technologies. Acquisitions, alliances and investments involve numerous risks, including:\n\u25cf\nThe potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition;\n\u25cf\nDifficulties in and the cost of integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel;\n\u25cf\nDiversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations;\n\u25cf\nRisk of entering new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions;\n\u25cf\nPotential write-offs of acquired assets or investments, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers;\n\u25cf\nPotential loss of key employees;\n\u25cf\nInability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs;\n\u25cf\nThe inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business;\n\u25cf\nThe difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and maintaining the security standards consistent with our other services for such technology;\n\u25cf\nPotential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses;\n\u25cf\nUnanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into existing technology;\n\u25cf\nNegative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation, and the loss of acquired deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue;\n\u25cf\nDelays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition;\n\u25cf\nThe need to implement controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company;\n\u25cf\nChallenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences;\n\u25cf\nIn the case of foreign acquisitions, the challenges associated with integrating operations across different cultures and languages and currency, technological, employee and other regulatory risks and uncertainties in the economic, social and political conditions associated with specific countries; and\n\u25cf\nThe tax effects of any such acquisitions.\nOur failure to successfully manage the acquisitions of Mediasite KK and Sonic Foundry International, or other future acquisitions, strategic alliances or partnerships could seriously harm our operating results. In addition, our stockholders would be diluted if we finance the future acquisitions, strategic alliances or partnerships by incurring convertible debt or issuing equity securities.\nCompany Risks - Compliance\nOur customers may use our products to share confidential and sensitive information, and if our system security is breached, our reputation could be harmed and we may lose customers.\nOur customers may use our products and services to share confidential and sensitive information, the security of which is critical to their business. Third parties may attempt to breach our security for customer hosted content or the networks of our customers.\nSonic Foundry, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nFor the Year Ended September 30, 2020\nMalicious third-parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services. Customers may take inadequate security precautions with their sensitive information and may inadvertently make that information public. We may be liable to our customers or subject to fines for a breach in security, and any breach could harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers. In addition, customers are vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, which could lead to interruptions, delays or loss of data. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to further protect against security breaches or to resolve problems caused by any breach, including litigation-related expenses if we are sued.\nOur business is subject to changing regulations regarding corporate governance and public disclosure that will increase both our costs and the risk of noncompliance.\nAs a publicly traded company we are subject to significant regulations, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices and continue to update the program in response to newly implemented regulatory requirements and guidance, we cannot assure that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable regulations.\nAlthough our non-affiliate market capitalization was less than $75 million at March 31, 2020 and we were therefore not required to have an auditor attestation on our internal controls over financial reporting for fiscal 2020, SEC rules may in the future require us to have such an attestation if our non-affiliate market capitalization exceeds a certain threshold. We have found material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the past and cannot assure that in the future our management or our auditors, will not find additional material weaknesses in connection with our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We also cannot assure that we could correct all such weaknesses to allow our management to attest that we have maintained effective internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year in time to enable our independent registered public accounting firm to attest that such assessment will have been fairly stated in our Annual Report on Form 10-K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission or attest that we have maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year. If we fail to comply with any of these regulations, we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions, fines, or other sanctions or litigation. In addition, the disclosure of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could have a negative impact on our stock price.\nOn June 28, 2018, the SEC adopted amendments that raise the thresholds in the smaller reporting company (\"SRC\") definition, thereby expanding the number of smaller reporting companies eligible to comply with the scaled disclosure requirements in several Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X items. On March 12, 2020, the SEC adopted an amendment that provides for a new subset of firms with annual revenues of less than $100 million and a public float of $250 million or more, but less than $700 million, or public float of $75 million or more, but less than $250 million, regardless of annual revenues, that also qualify as smaller reporting companies to be exempt from the requirement to have an auditor attestation on its internal controls over financial reporting. The amended definition of a smaller reporting company, and the creation of a new subset of firms that are exempt from the auditor attestation requirement, reduces the likelihood that the Company would be required to have auditor attestation on our internal controls over financial reporting in future periods.\nIndustry Risks\nEconomic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company.\nWeakness in domestic markets and global uncertainties exist in many areas of focus for us including the United Kingdom, Japan and the Middle East. Many of our customers rely on local, state or Federal government funding, both domestic and international. The Japanese government provides subsidies to support higher education from time to time but has not been consistent. Any future delay or elimination of government programs will have a negative impact on our operations in Japan. Any continuing unfavorable economic conditions could continue to negatively affect our business operating results or financial condition, which could in turn affect our stock price. Weak economic conditions and the resulting impact on the availability of public funds along with the possibility of state and local budget cuts and reduced university enrollment could lead to a reduction in demand for our products and services. In addition, a prolonged economic downturn could cause insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays, inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of the Company\u2019s products and inability or delay of our channel partners and other customers to pay accounts receivable owed to us.\nEconomic conditions may have a disproportionate effect on the sale of our products.\nMany of our customers will look at the total A/V equipment and labor cost to outfit a typical conference room or lecture hall as one amount for budgetary purposes. Consequently, although our products represent only a portion of the total cost, the cost of the entire project of outfitting a room or conference hall may be considered excessive and may not survive budgetary constraints. Alternatively, our resellers may modify their quotes to end customers by eliminating our products or substituting less expensive products supplied by our competitors in order to win opportunities within budget constraints. Event service partners may similarly suggest that customers eliminate recording and webcasting as a means of reducing event cost. Consequently, declines in spending by government, educational or corporate institutions due to budgetary constraints may have a disproportionate impact on the Company and result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition.\nSonic Foundry, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nFor the Year Ended September 30, 2020\nWe could lose revenues if there are changes in the spending policies or budget priorities for government funding of colleges, universities, schools and other education providers.\nMost of our customers and potential customers are public colleges, universities, schools and other education providers who depend substantially on government funding. Accordingly, any general decrease, delay or change in federal, state or local funding for colleges, universities, schools and other education providers could cause our current and potential customers to reduce or delay their purchases of our products and services, or to decide not to renew service contracts, either of which could cause us to lose revenues. In addition, a specific reduction in governmental funding support for products such as ours would also cause us to lose revenues. Unfavorable economic conditions may result in further budget cuts and lead to lower overall spending, including information technology spending, by our current and potential clients, which may cause our revenues to decrease.\nChanges in U.S. trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences, may have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe U.S. government has indicated its intent to adopt a new approach to trade policy and in some cases to renegotiate, or potentially terminate, certain existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements. It has also initiated tariffs on certain foreign goods and has raised the possibility of imposing significant, additional tariff increases or expanding the tariffs to capture other types of goods. In response, certain foreign governments have imposed retaliatory tariffs on goods that their countries import from the U.S. Changes in U.S. trade policy have resulted in one or more foreign governments, including China, adopting responsive trade policies that make it more difficult or costly for us to do business in or import our products from those countries. As a result of tariffs in China, the cost of our products has increased. Additional trade restrictions may lead to increased prices to our customers, which may reduce demand, or, if we are unable to achieve increased prices, result in lowering our margin on products sold.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which the U.S. or other countries will impose quotas, duties, tariffs, taxes or other similar restrictions upon the import or export of our products in the future, nor can we predict future trade policy or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements and their impact on our business. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and the U.S. economy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nPrivacy concerns and laws, evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our solutions and adversely affect our business.\nRegulation related to the provision of services on the Internet is increasing, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage and use of personal information, including health data. In some cases, foreign data privacy laws and regulations, such as the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation that was enacted in May 2018, and an amended Act on the Protection of Personal Information in Japan, impose new obligations directly on us both as a data controller and a data processor, as well as on many of our customers. These new laws may require us to make changes to our services and/or our customers to meet the new legal requirements, and may also increase our potential liability exposure through higher potential penalties for non-compliance. Further, laws such as the European Union\u2019s proposed e-Privacy Regulation are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes, and the tracking of individuals\u2019 online activities. These new or proposed laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. These and other requirements could reduce demand for our services, require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to store, transfer and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability to offer our services in certain locations or our customers' ability to deploy our solutions globally. For example, ongoing legal challenges in Europe to the mechanisms allowing companies to transfer personal data from the European Economic Area to the United States could result in further limitations on the ability to transfer data across borders, particularly if governments are unable or unwilling to reach new or maintain existing agreements that support cross-border data transfers, such as the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield framework. Additionally, certain countries have passed or are considering passing laws requiring local data residency. In addition, domestic data privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which took effect in January 2020, continue to evolve and could expose us to further regulatory burdens. Further, laws such as the European Union\u2019s proposed e-Privacy Regulation are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes, and the tracking of individuals\u2019 online activities. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, privacy laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services, reduce overall demand for our services, make it more difficult to meet expectations from or commitments to customers, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, any of which could harm our business.\nWe likely will need to acquire software and hardware in order to enhance our ability to defend and to detect intrusions to our network infrastructure. These enhancements will be expensive and require significant staff time to deploy and develop. These risks are mitigated, to the extent possible, by our ability to maintain and improve business and data governance policies, enhanced processes and internal security controls, including our ability to escalate and respond to known and potential risks. Our executive management are regularly briefed on our cyber-security policies and practices and ongoing efforts to improve security, as well as periodic updates on cyber-security events. In addition, we update our Audit Committee at least annually regarding our processes for evaluating and mitigating risks including cyber related risks. Although we have developed systems and processes designed to protect our customers\u2019 and our customers\u2019 customers\u2019 proprietary and other sensitive data, we can provide no assurances that such measures will be effective.\nIn addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established, or may establish, new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. Many of our customers in the European Union face increasingly complex procurement requirements that have delayed some projects and caused us not to be successful in winning other opportunities. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business.\nSonic Foundry, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nFor the Year Ended September 30, 2020\nOur customers and potential customers do business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector, healthcare and telecommunications. Regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit customers\u2019 use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services.\nThe costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by laws, regulations and standards, may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance.\nFurthermore, concerns regarding data privacy may cause the users of our customers\u2019 data to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively. Even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions.\nWe face risks associated with government regulation of the internet and related legal uncertainties.\nCurrently, few existing laws or regulations specifically apply to the Internet, other than laws generally applicable to businesses. Many Internet-related laws and regulations, however, are pending and may be adopted in the United States, in individual states and local jurisdictions and in other countries. These laws may relate to many areas that impact our business, including encryption, network and information security, and the convergence of traditional communication services, such as telephone services, with Internet communications, taxes and wireless networks. These types of regulations could differ between countries and other political and geographic divisions both inside and outside the United States. Non-U.S. countries and political organizations may impose, or favor, more and different regulation than that which has been proposed in the United States, thus furthering the complexity of regulation. Certain countries have implemented, or may implement, legislative and technological actions that either do or can effectively regulate access to the Internet, including the ability of Internet Service Providers to limit access to specific websites or content. In addition, state and local governments within the United States may impose regulations in addition to, inconsistent with, or stricter than federal regulations. The adoption of such laws or regulations, and uncertainties associated with their validity, interpretation, applicability and enforcement, may affect the available distribution channels for, and the costs associated with, our products and services. The adoption of such laws and regulations may harm our business.\nInvestor Risks\nThe market price of our common stock may be subject to volatility.\nIn the past and through 2020, the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been more volatile than the broader market. Factors affecting the market price of our common stock include:\n\u25cf\nVariations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, deferred revenue and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, and how those results compare to investor expectations;\n\u25cf\nOur announcement of actual results for a fiscal period that are higher or lower than expected results;\n\u25cf\nChanges in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;\n\u25cf\nAnnouncements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u25cf\nAnnouncements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nAnnouncements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases;\n\u25cf\nRecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf\nDisruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software, network or data center problems;\n\u25cf\nThe economy, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers;\n\u25cf\nThe issuance of shares of common stock and preferred stock by us, whether in connection with an acquisition or a capital raising transaction;\n\u25cf\nLow trading volumes of our shares and inconsistent trading activity;\n\u25cf\nIssuance of debt, changes to, defaults or non-renewal of debt facilities and other convertible securities;\n\u25cf\nFailure to meet OTC market requirements; and\n\u25cf\nAny other factors discussed herein.\n\u25cf\nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us.\nSonic Foundry, Inc.\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\nFor the Year Ended September 30, 2020\nOur common stock is subject to low trading volume and broad price swings.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTC Market (\u201cOTC Pink Sheets\u201d) administered by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority under the symbol \u201cSOFO\u201d since February 18, 2019. Prior to that, our common stock was traded on the OTCQB since December 31, 2018 and before that, the NASDAQ exchange under the same symbol. Trading of our stock on the OTC Pink Sheets has often been subject to very low volumes, broad price swings and often with no Company news.\nExercise of outstanding options and warrants will result in further dilution.\nThe issuance of shares of common stock upon the exercise of our outstanding options and warrants will result in dilution to the interests of our stockholders, and may reduce the trading price of our common stock.\nAt September 30, 2020, we had 299 thousand outstanding warrants and 1.7 million of outstanding stock options granted under our stock option plans, 1.4 million of which are immediately exercisable.\nWhile nearly all outstanding warrants and options are currently priced above the market price of our common stock, dilution to the interests of our stockholders will likely occur if or when they are exercised. Additional options and warrants may be issued in the future at prices not less than 85% of the fair market value of the underlying security on the date of grant. Exercises of these options, or even the potential of their exercise may have an adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock. The holders of our options are likely to exercise them at times when the market price of the common stock exceeds the exercise price of the securities. Accordingly, the issuance of shares of common stock upon exercise of the options will likely result in dilution of the equity represented by the then outstanding shares of common stock held by other stockholders. Holders of our options can be expected to exercise or convert them at a time when we would, in all likelihood, be able to obtain any needed capital on terms, which are more favorable to us than the exercise terms provided, by these options.\nProvisions of our charter documents and Maryland law could also discourage an acquisition of our Company that would benefit our stockholders and, due to our insiders control of a substantial percentage of our stock, our officers, directors, and major stockholders will have a substantial amount of control over whether to approve or disapprove of a transaction.\nProvisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our company, even if a change in control would benefit our stockholders. Our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue one or more series of preferred stock, which could have voting and conversion rights that adversely affect or dilute the voting power of the holders of common stock. Furthermore, our articles of incorporation provide for a classified board of directors, which means that our stockholders may vote upon the retention of only one or two of our five directors each year. Moreover, Maryland corporate law restricts certain business combination transactions with \u201cinterested stockholders\u201d and limits voting rights upon certain acquisitions of \u201ccontrol shares.\u201d In addition, even when there are no interested stockholders involved in a transaction, Maryland law requires that a transaction involving a merger, consolidation, transfer of assets, or share exchange, must be approved by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nOur executive officers and directors together beneficially own, on an \u201cas converted basis\u201d, over 50% of our outstanding common stock, and Mr. Burish, individually, owns nearly 42% on an as converted basis. As a result, these stockholders, if they act together or in a block, or individually in the case of Mr. Burish, could have significant influence over most matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the approval of significant corporate transactions, even if other stockholders oppose them. In addition, under federal law, in many circumstances a company such as Sonic Foundry is not required to disclose that negotiations relating to a merger or to a sale of its stock or assets are occurring until a material definitive agreement has been reached. Concentration of ownership as described here might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our Company that other stockholders may view as beneficial.", "PERMNO": 85953, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "SOFO"}
