{"cik": "911148", "company": "CADUS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in the shares of Cadus\u2019 common stock involves a high degree of risk. Accordingly, investors and prospective investors should consider carefully the following risk factors, as well as all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in connection with investments in shares of Cadus\u2019 common stock.\nThe Company is implementing a new business plan.\nThe Company has decided not to maintain or seek to license or sell its drug discovery technologies. The Company has determined that it will seek to purchase individual homes or individual residential lots for purposes of renovation or construction and resale. The Company has very limited operating experience in this business and the Company\u2019s limited operating history makes it difficult to predict the long-term success of its business model. In addition, because of the Company\u2019s new business plan, the Company\u2019s historical performance is not a meaningful indicator of future results.\nUncertainty of Future Profitability\nThe Company's ability to generate revenues and become profitable is dependent in large part on the ability of the Company to acquire residential homes and lots, renovate existing homes or construct new ones and sell them at a profit. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to do so or that the Company will ever achieve profitability.\nInability to Identify and Consummate Acquisitions or Investments\nAlthough the Company intends to engage in the purchase and renovation of existing homes for resale and the purchase of land and the building of residential homes on such land for sale, the Company is also seeking to acquire or invest in companies or income producing assets. To date the Company has not been able to identify and consummate an appropriate acquisition or investment in companies or income producing assets and there can be no assurance that it will do so. There also can be no assurance that acquisitions or investments by the Company will be profitable.\nThe Company\u2019s long-term success depends on its ability to acquire at reasonable prices existing residential properties suitable for renovation or construction and resale.\nThe acquisition of residential homes and lots for renovation or construction and resale is highly competitive and the risk inherent in purchasing and renovating or constructing such properties increases as consumer demand for housing increases. The availability of existing residential properties, finished and partially finished developed lots and undeveloped land for purchase that meet the Company\u2019s investment criteria depends on a number of factors outside the Company\u2019s control, including residential housing and land availability in general, competition with other homebuilders and land and home buyers, inflation in land and home prices, zoning, allowable housing density, the ability to obtain building permits and other regulatory requirements. Should suitable residential homes, lots or land become less available, the number of homes the Company may be able to renovate or build and sell could be reduced, and the cost of existing homes or land could be increased, perhaps substantially, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nAs competition for suitable homes and land increases, the cost of acquiring existing homes and finished and undeveloped lots and the cost of renovating or constructing homes could rise and the availability of suitable homes and land at acceptable prices may decline, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial results. The availability of suitable homes and land assets could also affect the success of the Company\u2019s residential homes and land acquisition strategy, which may impact the Company\u2019s ability to increase the number of properties that it has for sale, to grow the Company\u2019s revenues and margins, and to achieve or maintain profitability.\nThe market value of the Company\u2019s land and/or homes may decline, leading to impairments and reduced profitability.\nThe Company intends to regularly acquire residential homes and land for replacement and expansion of inventory within the Company\u2019s existing or new markets. The market value of land, building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions and the measures the Company employs to manage inventory risk may not be adequate to insulate its operations from a severe drop in inventory values. When market conditions are such that real estate values are not appreciating, previously entered into option agreements may become less desirable, at which time the Company may elect to forgo deposits and preacquisition costs and terminate the agreements. In a situation of adverse market conditions, the Company may incur impairment charges or have to sell its real estate inventory at a loss which would adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and stockholders' equity and its ability to comply with covenants in any future debt instruments linked to tangible net worth.\nThe Company\u2019s home sales and operating revenues could decline due to macro-economic and other factors outside of its control, such as changes in consumer confidence, declines in employment levels, changes in mortgage interest rates, changes in tax laws and rates and increases in the quantity and decreases in the prices of new homes and resale homes in the market.\nChanges in international, national and regional economic conditions, as well as local economic conditions where the Company conducts its operations and where prospective purchasers of its homes currently live, may result in more caution on the part of homebuyers and, consequently, fewer home purchases. These economic uncertainties involve, among other things, conditions of supply and demand in local markets and changes in consumer confidence and income, employment levels, changes in mortgage interest rates, changes in tax laws and rates, and government regulations. These risks and uncertainties could periodically have an adverse effect on consumer demand for and the pricing of the Company\u2019s homes, which could cause the Company\u2019s operating revenues and profitability to decline. Such reductions in the Company\u2019s revenues and profitability could, in turn, negatively affect the market price of the Company\u2019s securities.\nIncreases in the cost of labor or materials could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nAny increase in the cost of labor or materials could increase construction costs and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nOur geographic concentration could materially and adversely affect us if sales of new homes and resale homes in Florida should experience a decline.\nThe Company currently intends to concentrate its real estate acquisition, renovation and construction activities in Florida. A prolonged economic downturn in the future in Florida could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, and a disproportionately greater impact on us than other homebuilders with more diversified operations.\nMoreover, certain insurance companies doing business in Florida have restricted, curtailed or suspended the issuance of homeowners\u2019 insurance policies on single-family homes. This has both reduced the availability of hurricane and other types of natural disaster insurance in Florida, in general, and increased the cost of such insurance to prospective purchasers of homes in Florida. Mortgage financing for a new home is conditioned, among other things, on the availability of adequate homeowners\u2019 insurance. There can be no assurance that homeowners\u2019 insurance will be available or affordable to prospective purchasers of our homes offered for sale in the Florida market. Long-term restrictions on, or unavailability of, homeowners\u2019 insurance in the Florida market could have an adverse effect on the homebuilding industry in that market in general, and on our business within the market in particular.\nThe homebuilding industry is cyclical. A severe downturn in the industry, as recently experienced, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and stockholders' equity.\nDuring periods of downturn in the industry, housing markets across the United States may experience an oversupply of both new and resale home inventory, an increase in foreclosures, reduced levels of consumer demand for new homes, increased cancellation rates, aggressive price competition among homebuilders and increased incentives for home sales. In the event of a downturn, the Company may temporarily experience a material reduction in revenues and margins. Continued weakness in the homebuilding market could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and stockholders' equity as compared to prior periods and could result in additional inventory impairments in the future.\nThe Company will be dependent on the continued availability and satisfactory performance of its general contractors and their subcontractors, which, if unavailable, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company will conduct its renovation and construction operations through one or more general contractors and their respective subcontractors. As a consequence, the Company will depend on the continued availability of and satisfactory performance by its general contractors and their respective subcontractors for the renovation and constructions of its homes. There may not be sufficient availability of and satisfactory performance by these general contractors and subcontractors in the markets in which the Company operates. In addition, inadequate subcontractor resources could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company will be dependent on the services of certain key employees, and the loss of their services could hurt its business.\nThe Company\u2019s future success will depend upon its ability to attract, train, assimilate and retain skilled personnel. If the Company is unable to retain key employees or attract, train, assimilate or retain other skilled personnel in the future, it could hinder its business strategy and impose additional costs of identifying and training new individuals. The Company anticipates that competition for qualified personnel in its operating markets will be intense.\nLoans obtained by the Company may impose significant restrictions and obligations on the Company. Restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to borrow could adversely affect its liquidity. In addition, any substantial indebtedness could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, limit its growth and make it more difficult for the Company to satisfy its debt obligations.\nAny secured or unsecured indebtedness or revolving credit or letter of credit facilities obtained by the Company will impose certain restrictions and obligations on the Company. Under certain of these instruments, the Company may be required to comply with defined covenants which limit the Company's ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, engage in certain asset sales, make certain types of restricted payments, engage in transactions with affiliates and create liens on assets of the Company. Failure to comply with certain of these covenants could result in an event of default under the applicable instrument. Any such event of default could negatively impact other covenants or lead to cross defaults under other debt of the Company. In such cases, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain any waivers or amendments that may become necessary in the event of a future default situation without significant additional cost or at all.\nAny substantial indebtedness of the Company could have important consequences to it and the holders of its securities, including, among other things:\n\u00b7 causing the Company to be unable to satisfy its obligations under its debt agreements;\n\u00b7 making the Company more vulnerable to adverse general economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7 making it difficult to fund future working capital, home and land purchases, renovation and construction, general corporate purposes or other purposes; and\n\u00b7 causing the Company to be limited in its flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business.\nIn addition, subject to restrictions in its debt instruments, the Company may incur additional indebtedness. If new debt is added to the Company\u2019s then current debt levels, the related risks that the Company then faces could intensify. The Company\u2019s growth plans and its ability to make payments of principal or interest on, or to refinance, its indebtedness, will depend on its future operating performance and its ability to enter into additional debt and/or equity financings. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flows in the future to service its debt, it may be required to refinance all or a portion of its then existing debt, to sell assets or to obtain additional financing. The Company may not be able to do any of the foregoing on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all.\nA substantial increase in short-term and/or long-term mortgage interest rates, the unavailability of mortgage financing or a change in tax laws regarding the deductibility of mortgage interest may reduce consumer demand for the Company\u2019s homes.\nPurchasers of the Company\u2019s homes may finance their acquisition with mortgage financing. Housing demand is adversely affected by reduced availability of mortgage financing and factors that increase the upfront or monthly cost of financing a home such as increases in interest rates, insurance premiums, or limitations on mortgage interest deductibility. The recent decrease in the willingness and ability of lenders to make home mortgage loans, the tightening of lending standards and the limitation of financing product options, have made it more difficult for homebuyers to obtain acceptable financing. Any substantial increase in short-term and/or long-term mortgage interest rates or unavailability of mortgage financing may adversely affect the ability of prospective homebuyers to obtain financing for the Company\u2019s homes, as well as adversely affect the ability of prospective homebuyers to sell their current homes. A disruption in the credit markets and/or the curtailed availability of mortgage financing may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf the Company is unsuccessful in competing against its homebuilding competitors, any future market share of the Company could decline or the Company\u2019s growth could be impaired and, as a result, the Company\u2019s financial results could suffer.\nCompetition in the homebuilding industry is intense, there are relatively low barriers to entry into this business, and we may not be able to compete successfully. Increased competition could hurt the Company\u2019s business, as it could prevent the Company from acquiring existing homes or parcels of land on which to build homes or make such acquisitions more expensive, hinder the Company\u2019s market share expansion, and lead to pricing pressures on its homes that may adversely impact its margins and revenues. If the Company is unable to successfully compete, its financial results could suffer and the value of, or its ability to service, any of its indebtedness could be adversely affected. The Company\u2019s competitors may independently renovate existing homes or construct new homes that are superior or substantially similar to the Company\u2019s products. Furthermore, a number of the anticipated competitors of the Company will have substantially greater financial resources and lower costs of funds than will the Company. Many of these competitors will also have longstanding relationships with subcontractors and suppliers in the markets in which the Company operates.\nThe Company could experience a reduction in home sales and revenues or reduced cash flows due to its inability to acquire existing homes or finished lots or undeveloped land for renovation or construction, if it is unable to obtain reasonably priced financing to support its homebuilding activities.\nThe homebuilding industry is capital intensive, and homebuilding requires significant up-front expenditures to acquire existing homes or land and to begin development. Accordingly, the Company will seek equity or debt financing from a variety of potential sources, including lender financing and/or securities offerings. The availability of borrowed funds, especially for construction financing and existing home or land acquisition, may be greatly reduced nationally, and the lending community may require increased amounts of equity to be invested in a project by borrowers in connection with both new loans and the extension of existing loans. The credit and capital markets have recently experienced significant volatility. If the Company is required to seek additional financing to fund its operations, continued volatility in these markets may restrict the Company\u2019s flexibility to access such financing. If the Company is not successful in obtaining sufficient financing to fund its planned capital and other expenditures, it may be unable to acquire existing homes or land for its homebuilding activities. Additionally, if the Company cannot obtain financing to fund the purchase of real estate properties under contracts entered into by the Company, the Company may lose deposits or otherwise incur contractual penalties and fees.\nThe Company is subject to government regulation which could cause it to incur significant liabilities or restrict its business activities.\nRegulatory requirements could cause the Company to incur significant liabilities and operating expenses and could restrict its business activities. The Company is subject to local, state and federal statutes and rules regulating, among other things, certain developmental matters, building and site design, and matters concerning the protection of health and the environment. The Company\u2019s operating expenses may be increased by governmental regulations such as building permit allocation ordinances and impact and other fees and taxes, which may be imposed to defray the cost of providing certain governmental services and improvements. Any delay or refusal from government agencies to grant the Company necessary licenses, permits and approvals could have an adverse effect on its operations.\nThe Company may incur additional operating expenses due to compliance programs or fines, penalties and remediation costs pertaining to environmental regulations.\nThe Company is subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment. The particular environmental laws which apply vary greatly according to the location of the site, the site's environmental conditions and the present and former use of the site. Environmental laws may result in delays, may cause the Company to implement time consuming and expensive compliance programs and may prohibit or severely restrict development or construction in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas. From time to time, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and similar federal or state agencies review homebuilders' compliance with environmental laws and may levy fines and penalties for failure to strictly comply with applicable environmental laws or impose additional requirements for future compliance as a result of past failures. Any such actions taken with respect to the Company may increase the Company\u2019s costs. Further, the Company expects that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on homebuilders in the future. Environmental regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials such as lumber.\nThe Company may be subject to significant potential liabilities as a result of construction defect, product liability and warranty claims made against it.\nAs a homebuilder, the Company will be subject to construction defect, product liability and home warranty claims, including moisture intrusion and related claims, arising in the ordinary course of business. These claims are common to the homebuilding industry and can be costly.\nWith respect to certain general liability exposures, including construction defect claims, product liability claims and related claims, interpretation of underlying current and future trends, assessment of claims and the related liability and reserve estimation process is highly judgmental due to the complex nature of these exposures, with each exposure exhibiting unique circumstances. Furthermore, once claims are asserted for construction defects, it can be difficult to determine the extent to which the assertion of these claims will expand geographically.\nThe Company\u2019s operating expenses could increase if it were required to pay higher insurance premiums or litigation costs for various claims, which could cause the Company\u2019s net income to decline.\nThe costs of insuring against construction defects, product liability claims and claims against directors and officers are substantial. Increasingly in recent years, lawsuits (including class action lawsuits) have been filed against builders, asserting claims of personal injury and property damage. Insurance obtained by the Company may not cover all of the claims, including personal injury claims, or such coverage may become prohibitively expensive. If the Company is not able to obtain adequate insurance against these claims, the Company may experience losses that could reduce its net income and restrict its cash flow available to service debt.\nHistorically, builders have recovered from general contractors, subcontractors and insurance carriers a significant portion of the construction defect liabilities and costs of defense that the builders have incurred. Insurance coverage available to general contractors and subcontractors for construction defects is becoming increasingly expensive, and the scope of coverage is restricted. If the Company cannot effectively recover from its general contractors or their respective subcontractors or their carriers, it may suffer greater losses which could decrease its net income.\nA builder's ability to recover against any available insurance policy depends upon the continued solvency and financial strength of the insurance carrier that issued the policy. Many states have lengthy statutes of limitations applicable to claims for construction defects. To the extent that any carrier providing insurance coverage to the Company or its general contractors or their respective subcontractors becomes insolvent or experiences financial difficulty in the future, the Company may be unable to recover on those policies, and its net income may decline.\nThe Company may experience fluctuations and variability in its operating results and, as a result, its historical performance may not be a meaningful indicator of future results.\nThe Company expects to experience variability in home sales and net earnings. As a result of such variability, the Company\u2019s historical performance may not be a meaningful indicator of future results. The Company\u2019s results of operations may fluctuate in the future as a result of a variety of both national and local factors, including, among others:\n\u00b7 the timing of real estate acquisitions and home closings;\n\u00b7 the Company\u2019s ability to continue to acquire additional properties for renovation or construction or to secure contracts to acquire additional properties on acceptable terms;\n\u00b7 conditions of the real estate market in areas where the Company operates and of the general economy;\n\u00b7 raw material and labor shortages;\n\u00b7 seasonal home buying patterns; and\n\u00b7 other changes in operating expenses, including the cost of labor and raw materials, personnel and general economic conditions.\nThe occurrence of natural disasters could increase the Company\u2019s operating expenses and reduce its revenues and cash flows.\nThe climates and geology of states in which the Company operates may present increased risks of natural disasters. To the extent that hurricanes, severe storms, earthquakes, droughts, floods, wildfires or other natural disasters or similar events occur, the Company\u2019s homes under renovation or construction or the Company\u2019s building lots could be damaged or destroyed, which may result in losses exceeding the Company\u2019s insurance coverage. Any of these events could increase the Company\u2019s operating expenses, impair its cash flows and reduce its revenues, which could, in turn, negatively affect the market price of the Company\u2019s securities.\nTerrorist attacks against the United States or increased domestic or international instability could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations.\nAdverse developments in the war on terrorism, terrorist attacks against the United States, or any outbreak or escalation of hostilities between the United States and any foreign power, may cause disruption to the economy, the Company, its employees and its customers, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues, operating expenses, and financial condition.\nHistory of Operating Losses\nThe Company has incurred operating losses in each year since its inception with the exception of 2002. At December 31, 2015, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $38.7 million. The Company\u2019s losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with its previous research and development activities and from general and administrative costs associated with the Company\u2019s operations. These costs have exceeded the Company\u2019s revenues and interest income.\nUncertainty of Utilization of Operating Loss and Research and Development Credit Carryforwards.\nThe Company had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately $20.7 million and a research and development credit carryforward of approximately $1.5 million at December 31, 2015. These net operating loss carryforwards and the research and development credit carryforward expire in various years from 2018 to 2035. The Company's ability to utilize such net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards for income tax savings is subject to certain conditions and may be subject to certain limitations in the future due to ownership changes, if any, as defined by rules enacted with the Tax Reform Act of 1986. As such, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to utilize such carryforwards.\nUncertainty of Access to Capital\nThere can be no assurance that additional funding, if necessary, will be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nControl by Existing Stockholders; Concentration of Stock Ownership\nCarl C. Icahn beneficially owns, as of March 15, 2016, approximately 67.81% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. As a result, Mr. Icahn, acting alone, will be able to control most matters requiring approval by the stockholders of the Company, including the election of directors, the adoption of charter amendments, and the approval of mergers and other extraordinary corporate transactions. Such a concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices.\nAnti-Takeover Effect of Delaware Corporate Law\nCertain provisions of the Delaware corporate law may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in the control or management of the Company, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market prices.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price is volatile and could decline.\nThe securities markets in general and the Company\u2019s common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility over the past few years. The market price and volume of the Company\u2019s common stock may continue to experience significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding the Company\u2019s industry, operations or business prospects. In addition to the other risk factors discussed in this section, the price and volume volatility of the Company\u2019s common stock may be affected by:\n\u00b7 operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u00b7 factors influencing home purchases, such as availability of home mortgage loans and interest rates, credit criteria applicable to prospective borrowers, ability to sell existing residences, and homebuyer sentiment in general;\n\u00b7 the operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider comparable to the Company;\n\u00b7 announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by the Company or its competitors;\n\u00b7 changes in government regulations applicable to our business; and\n\u00b7 changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest rates, commodity and equity prices and the value of financial assets.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or otherwise use its common stock as consideration is impacted by the price of its common stock. A low stock price may adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to reduce its financial leverage, as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capital. High levels of leverage or significant increases may adversely affect the Company\u2019s credit ratings and make it more difficult for the Company to access additional capital. These factors may limit the Company\u2019s ability to implement its operating and growth plans.\nAbsence of Dividends\nThe Company has not paid any dividends on its Common Stock and does not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe Have a Limited Trading Market\nThere is a limited public trading market for our common stock on the over-the-counter bulletin board. We cannot assure you that a regular trading market for our common stock will ever develop or that, if developed, it will be sustained. Because of our limited public trading market, the market price for our common stock could be highly volatile and, accordingly, substantial fluctuations in the price of our common stock could limit the ability of our current stockholders to sell their shares at a favorable price.\nIf we ever become delinquent with the filing of our reports with the SEC, Rule 144 will no longer be available until and unless we become current.\nRule 144 provides, as indicated above, that sales of securities of Cadus may be made pursuant thereto only if Cadus has filed all relevant periodic reports that it is required to file. If we become delinquent with our SEC reports, any holders of restricted securities will not be able to sell pursuant to Rule 144 until, if ever, the Company becomes current for purposes of Rule 144. No assurance can be made that the Company will be able to remain current with its reports.", "PERMNO": 83769, "SIC": 6552, "TIC": "KDUS"}
