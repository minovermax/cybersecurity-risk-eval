Prior to making a decision about investing in our securities, you should carefully consider the specific risk factors discussed below and all of the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties we have described are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our operations. If any of these risks were to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Research, Development and Commercialization of Product Candidates\nWe are largely dependent on the success of Kanuma. All of our product candidates, including Kanuma, are still in development. Preclinical and clinical trials of our product candidates may not be successful.\nOur business prospects are largely dependent upon the successful development and commercialization of Kanuma. Before we can commercialize any of our product candidates, including Kanuma, we need to:\n\u2022\nconduct substantial research and development;\n\u2022\nundertake preclinical and clinical testing and other costly and time consuming measures;\n\u2022\nscale-up and transfer manufacturing processes while maintaining consistent product quality; and\n\u2022\npursue and obtain marketing and manufacturing approvals and, in some jurisdictions, pricing and reimbursement approvals.\nThis process involves a high degree of risk and takes many years. Our product development efforts with respect to a product candidate may fail for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nfailure of the product candidate in preclinical studies;\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, the required regulatory approvals to initiate or continue clinical studies for the product candidate;\n\u2022\nfailure of later trials to confirm positive results from earlier preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelays or difficulty enrolling patients in clinical trials, particularly for disease indications with small patient populations;\n\u2022\nfailure to identify a sufficient number of patients who meet the clinical trial enrollment criteria and/or who would support commercial launch and subsequent commercialization efforts;\n\u2022\npatients exhibiting adverse reactions to the product candidate or indications of other safety concerns;\n\u2022\ninsufficient clinical trial data to support the safety, effectiveness or superiority of the product candidate;\n\u2022\ninability to produce proteins with favorable or superior characteristics using our proprietary EW manufacturing platform;\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, the required regulatory approvals for the product candidate, or the facilities or processes used to manufacture the product candidate; or\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory or pricing and reimbursement environments could make development of a new product or further development of an existing product for a new indication no longer desirable.\nFew research and development projects result in commercial products, and success in preclinical studies or clinical trials often is not replicated in later studies.\nWe may decide to abandon development of a product candidate or service at any time, or we may be required to expend considerable resources repeating clinical trials or conducting additional trials, either of which would increase costs of development and delay any revenue from those programs. In addition, a regulatory authority may delay or deny an approval because it is not satisfied with the design, conduct, or results of clinical trials or due to its assessment of the data we supply.\nWe have neither obtained marketing approval, nor commercialized any of our current product candidates.\nWe recently submitted a BLA to the FDA and an MAA to the EMA for Kanuma as a treatment for patients with LAL Deficiency, but we have neither obtained marketing approval nor commercialized any of our current product candidates and do not know if or when we will receive marketing approval or generate revenue from the direct sale of an approved product, including Kanuma. We have only limited clinical experience. Our limited experience might prevent us from successfully designing or implementing a clinical trial for any of these indications. We may not be able to demonstrate that our product candidates meet the appropriate standards for regulatory approval, including because we may be unsuccessful in convincing regulatory authorities of the adequacy of the design of our trials or the sufficiency of the data generated from our clinical and other studies. If we are not successful in conducting and managing our preclinical development activities or clinical trials or obtaining regulatory approvals, we might not be able to commercialize our lead programs, or might be significantly delayed in doing so, which will materially harm our business.\nIf our preclinical or clinical studies do not produce positive results or are delayed or if serious side effects are identified during drug development, we may experience delays, incur additional costs, receive a narrow label, or ultimately be unable to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize our product candidates.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of our product candidates, we must conduct, at our own expense, extensive preclinical tests to demonstrate the safety of our product candidates in animals, and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Preclinical and clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement and can take many years to complete. A failure of one or more preclinical studies or clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. We may experience numerous events during, or as a result of,\npreclinical testing and the clinical trial process, including for potential new indications, which could delay or prevent our receipt of regulatory approval for, or the commercialization of, our product candidates, including:\n\u2022\nour preclinical tests or clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide or regulators may require us, to conduct additional preclinical testing prior to initiating clinical trials, or to suspend ongoing studies;\n\u2022\nwe may decide, or regulators may require us, to change the design of our preclinical studies or clinical trials in ways that may slow their progress, delay the initiation of clinical trials, or we may abandon projects that we expect to be promising;\n\u2022\na regulatory authority or institutional review board may not authorize us to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022\nconditions imposed on us by the FDA or any non-U.S. regulatory authority regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to these authorities or to institutional review boards or ethics committees for re-review due to changes in the regulatory environment;\n\u2022\nthe number of patients required for clinical trials may be larger than we anticipate or are able to enroll, or participants may drop out of, or not qualify for, clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nour third-party contractors or clinical investigators may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or fail to meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner or at all;\n\u2022\nwe might have to suspend or terminate one or more of our clinical trials if we, a regulatory authority or an institutional review board or ethics committee determine that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\na regulatory authority or institutional review board or ethics committee may require that we hold, suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\na regulatory authority may require that we conduct additional clinical research to provide additional information regarding the efficacy or safety of Kanuma;\n\u2022\nthe cost of our clinical trials may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nthe supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct our clinical trials may be insufficient or inadequate or we may not be able to reach agreements on acceptable terms with prospective contract manufacturing organizations;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to produce, or sufficiently test, comparable or consistent drug materials derived from different manufacturing facilities operated by us or from processes run by third party manufacturers which could impact our ability or timing with respect to receiving regulatory approval for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to reach agreements on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations;\n\u2022\nif approved, we may not be able to reach agreements on acceptable terms with commercial distributors and other logistics providers; or\n\u2022\nthe effects of our product candidates may not be the desired effects, may include undesirable side effects, or the product candidates may have other unexpected characteristics.\nWe may obtain approval for indications that are not as broad as intended or entirely different than those indications for which we sought approval. For example, even though we met the pre-specified primary and six secondary endpoints in the Phase 3 clinical trial for children and adults, potential regulatory approval could be limited to the treatment of LAL Deficiency only in infants, and that would represent a small portion of the total LAL Deficiency patient population. If we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate or are unable to successfully complete our clinical trials or other testing or if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u2022\nbe delayed in obtaining, or may not be able to obtain, marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nincur substantial additional costs in conducting such additional clinical trials or other testing;\n\u2022\nobtain regulatory approval for only a narrower indication or an indication that might be otherwise qualified or constrained; or\n\u2022\nhave the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nOur product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or approvals. We do not know whether any preclinical tests or clinical trials will be initiated as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, if at all. Due to the limited term of a patent, significant preclinical or clinical trial delays could also shorten the period of time from marketing approval to patent expiration, during which we may benefit from patent protection of our product candidates. Such delays could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our products or product candidates.\nWe may find it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical trials.\nPotential patients for our product candidates may not be adequately diagnosed or identified with the diseases being targeted by our product candidates. Kanuma is being developed to treat LAL Deficiency, which is very rare. Based on prevalence estimates published in the medical literature, we estimate there are at least 3,000 children and adults with LAL Deficiency in the major reimbursable markets. In addition, we are recruiting patients to enroll in our Phase 1/2 trial for MPS IIIB. We may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials if we are unable to locate a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in the clinical trials required by the FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory agencies. In addition, the process of finding and diagnosing patients may prove costly. Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for any of our current or future clinical trials would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether.\nThe results of our clinical trials may not prove sufficient to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates, and subsequent trials may fail to replicate promising data seen in earlier preclinical studies and clinical trials.\nPromising results in our preclinical studies or clinical trials may not be replicated in ongoing and future studies or trials, and final data analysis may differ from interim data analysis. Even though we have reported positive top-line results from our Phase 3 clinical trial in children and adults with LAL Deficiency and our Phase 2/3 trial in infants with LAL Deficiency, and even if our other clinical trials for Kanuma are conducted and completed as planned, the results may not prove sufficient to obtain regulatory approval or result in a restricted product label that could negatively impact commercialization. Success in preclinical testing does not ensure success in clinical trials, and success in early stage clinical trials does not ensure success in later clinical trials. This can be due to a variety of reasons, including variations in patient populations, or the inability of certain patients to complete all assessments required by the clinical trial protocol, adjustments to clinical trial protocols or designs as compared to earlier testing or trials, variations in the data that could produce inconclusive or uninterpretable results, or the use of additional trial sites or investigators. Clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations, and regulatory agencies may not concur with our analysis of clinical trial data or its implications, which may result in delays in the regulatory approval process. Ongoing and future studies, including for new indications, may, for example, indicate safety concerns that regulatory authorities view as unacceptable. Final data analysis of our completed, ongoing and future clinical trials may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are sufficiently safe and effective for pursued or new indications. Any such failure could cause us to abandon a product candidate, substantially delay development of other product candidates, or require substantial expenditures to conduct additional trials. Both preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent initiation of clinical trials, regulatory approvals or commercialization. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials would delay our obtaining regulatory approval of the affected product candidate and, consequently, our ability to commercialize that product candidate and potentially our other product candidates. Development and commercialization of therapies for rare diseases requires expenditure of significant funds with no assurance of success.\nA regulatory authority may deny or delay approval of our product candidates, including Kanuma, because it is not satisfied with the structure or conduct of our clinical trials or due to its assessment of the data we supply, or may determine to approve our product candidates for use in narrow patient populations.\nA regulatory authority may not agree with the design or endpoints of our clinical trials. We sought advice from EMA for our Kanuma development plan, including the Phase 3 clinical trial design for Kanuma in children and adults with LAL Deficiency and EMA was supportive of our plan in principle. We did not seek a special protocol assessment with the FDA and do not have agreement with the FDA regarding the design or primary endpoint utilized in the Phase 3 clinical trial. Accordingly, we believe that we will need to demonstrate efficacy based on a totality of evidence including success on multiple endpoints in our clinical studies to support a favorable risk-benefit profile and provide substantial evidence of efficacy of Kanuma for the treatment of LAL Deficiency, including data from the Phase 3 clinical trial in children and adults, the Phase 2/3 open-label trial in infants with LAL Deficiency, as well as from the natural history studies for LAL Deficiency. Based on FDA feedback, it will be essential to link the primary endpoint for the Phase 3 clinical trial, ALT normalization, to other evidence of clinical benefit. We also will need to provide evidence to the FDA demonstrating that ALT normalization, alone or in combination with other endpoints, is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. If we are unable to do so, even though we met the pre-specified primary endpoint and six secondary endpoints in the Phase 3 clinical trial and the primary endpoint in the Phase 2/3 study in infants, we may not receive regulatory approval or we may receive narrower labeling with respect to the total LAL Deficiency patient population, unless and until we successfully complete additional clinical trials, if ever. In addition, regulatory authorities may not believe that we have provided sufficient safety data or adequately demonstrated clinical benefit in the patient population studied in the clinical trial. Clinical data is subject to varied interpretations, and regulatory authorities may disagree with our assessments of data. In any such case, a regulatory authority could insist that we provide additional data or conduct additional clinical studies, which could substantially delay or even prevent commercialization efforts, particularly if we are required to conduct additional pre-approval clinical studies. A positive opinion by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) is required for EMA approval and requires agreement among a majority of CHMP members, each of whom may have differing opinions on the strength of the evidence we may provide.\nPriority review for our drug product candidates may not actually lead to a faster review process, if at all.\nThe FDA has accepted for review the BLA for Kanuma for the treatment of LAL Deficiency. The FDA granted our request for Priority Review, which shortens the regulatory review period. The FDA established a target action date of September 8, 2015 under the PDUFA. The FDA review timeline for first cycle review could be longer and the FDA could issue a complete response letter requiring additional data to be submitted.\nBecause FDA also requires parallel approval of a New Animal Drug Application (NADA) for transgenic products such as Kanuma, this could create delays in the review and approval process for the BLA. A lengthier review process will delay revenue from the sale of products and will increase the capital necessary to fund our product development programs. In addition, Kanuma received Fast Track Designation by the FDA, and Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA for LAL Deficiency presenting in infants. The practical implications of Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designation on the regulatory review and approval process cannot be determined at this time and may not lead to a faster review or approval. In addition, the approval of the NADA and BLA will require successful completion of inspections and resolution of any significant issues raised during these inspections.\nWe also recently submitted an MAA to the EMA for Kanuma as a treatment for patients with LAL Deficiency. The EMA recently validated the MAA and granted our request for accelerated assessment, which has the potential to shorten the EMA\u2019s regulatory review time. However, the review timelines to reach a CHMP opinion and EMA action will depend in part on how efficiently we respond to questions which stop the clock during the review. In addition, the approval of the MAA will require successful completion of inspections and resolution of any significant issues raised during these inspections.\nOur product candidates, including Kanuma, if approved by any regulatory authorities could be subject to labeling and other restrictions, and we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations, oversight and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense.\nAny regulatory approvals that we obtain for our product candidates will be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses or patient population for which the product may be recommended for use or marketed, or to the conditions of approval, including a possible risk evaluation and mitigation strategy or post-marketing commitments, requirements, or follow-up measures. In addition, if the FDA, EMA or other regulatory authorities approve a product candidate, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, storage, adverse event reporting, dispensation, distribution, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements will include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, ongoing maintenance of product registration, as well as continued compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs), good clinical practices (GCPs) and good laboratory practices (GLPs). If we do not comply with the applicable regulations and requirements, the range of possible sanctions includes issuance of adverse publicity, product recalls or seizures, fines, total or partial suspensions of production and/or distribution, suspension of marketing applications, and enforcement actions, including injunctions and civil or criminal prosecution. The FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies can withdraw a product\u2019s approval under some circumstances, such as the failure to comply with regulatory requirements or unexpected safety issues.\nRegulatory approvals could also contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials and extraordinary requirements for surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the drug product. Post-marketing studies and/or post-market surveillance may suggest that a product causes undesirable side effects which present an increased risk to the patient. If data we collect from post-marketing studies suggest that one of our approved products may present a risk to safety, the regulatory authorities could withdraw our product approval, suspend production or place other labeling or marketing restrictions on our products. If regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is delayed or withdrawn, the value of our Company and our business, financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected.\nIf the market opportunities for our product candidates are smaller than we believe they are, our revenues may be adversely affected and our business may suffer.\nWe focus our research and product development on treatments for rare diseases. Our projections of both the number of people who have these diseases, as well as the subset of people with these diseases who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our product candidates, are based on estimates. In addition, the awareness of LAL Deficiency among treating health care providers is low. Currently, most reported estimates of the prevalence of these diseases are based on studies of small subsets of the population of specific geographic areas, which are then extrapolated to estimate the prevalence of the diseases in the broader world population. Based on prevalence estimates published in the medical literature, we estimate there are at least 3,000 children and adults with LAL Deficiency in the major reimbursable markets. In addition, there is no prevalent population for infants with LAL Deficiency, since these infants almost never survive beyond the first year of life. These estimates may prove to be incorrect and new studies may change the estimated prevalence of these diseases. If the estimates are incorrect, and the prevalence rate is lower than we anticipate, or if an approved indication is limited in any way, our commercial business may suffer.\nThe commercial success of any product candidate that we may develop, including Kanuma, will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third party payors and others in the medical community.\nAny future product that we may bring to the market, including Kanuma, may not gain market acceptance by physicians, patients, third party payors and others in the medical community. If our products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenue and may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of these product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects of the product, including any limitations or warnings contained in a product\u2019s approved labeling;\n\u2022\nthe perception of clinical benefit, safety, and potential advantages over alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u2022\nthe strength of marketing and distribution support and timing of market introduction of competitive products;\n\u2022\npublicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments; and\n\u2022\nsufficient third party insurance coverage or reimbursement in the countries or geographies where patients live.\nEven if a potential product displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile in preclinical and clinical trials, market acceptance of the product will not be known until after it is launched. Our efforts to educate the medical community and third party payors on the benefits of the product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful. Such efforts to educate the marketplace may require more resources than are required by the conventional technologies marketed by our competitors.\nUncertainties relating to third-party reimbursement and health care reform measures could limit payments or reimbursements for future products that we may develop could materially adversely affect our business.\nIn the U.S. and elsewhere, sales of prescription drugs depend in part on the consumers\u2019 ability to obtain reimbursement for the cost of the drugs from third-party payors, such as private and government insurance programs. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, including those related to rare diseases, in an effort to promote cost containment measures and alternative health care delivery systems. Our prospects for achieving profitability will depend heavily upon the availability of adequate reimbursement for the use of our approved product candidates from governmental and other third party payors, both in the U.S. and in other markets. Reimbursement by a third party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third party payor\u2019s determination that use of a product is:\n\u2022\na covered benefit under its health plan;\n\u2022\nsafe, effective and medically necessary;\n\u2022\nappropriate for the specific patient;\n\u2022\ncost-effective; and\n\u2022\nneither experimental nor investigational.\nObtaining reimbursement approval for a product from each governmental or other third party payor is a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost effectiveness data for the use of our products to each payor. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to reimbursement or might need to conduct post-marketing studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of any future products to such payors\u2019 satisfaction. Such studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources. Even when a payor determines that a product is eligible for reimbursement, the payor may impose coverage limitations that preclude payment for some uses that are approved by the FDA or non-U.S. regulatory authorities. In addition, there is a risk that full reimbursement may not be available for high priced products. Moreover, eligibility for coverage does not imply that any product will be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that allows us to make a profit or even cover our costs. Interim payments for new products, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover costs and may not be made permanent. Third party payors may attempt to contain health care costs by demanding price discounts or rebates and limiting both the types and variety of drugs that they will cover and the amounts that they will pay for drugs. As a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our products. Our products might not ultimately be considered cost-effective. Adequate third-party reimbursement might not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.\nReimbursement rates vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on payments allowed for lower-cost products that already are reimbursed, may be incorporated into existing payments for other products or services and may reflect budgetary constraints and/or imperfections in the data used to calculate these rates. Net prices for products are reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government\nhealth care programs and privately-negotiated discounts. The U.S. federal government, state governments and private payors frequently pursue actions against pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies alleging that the companies have overstated prices in order to inflate reimbursement rates. Any such action could adversely affect the pricing of and revenues from our products.\nSpecialty pharmaceuticals are drugs that are prescribed by specialist physicians to treat rare or life-threatening conditions and typically address smaller patient populations. Each of our product candidates is a specialty pharmaceutical product. The increasing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceuticals, combined with their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products, is beginning to generate significant third party payor interest in developing cost-containment strategies targeted to this sector. The increasing use of health technology assessments in markets around the world and the financial challenges faced by many governments may lead to significant adverse effects on our business.\nAny legislation or regulatory changes or relaxation of laws that restrict imports of drugs from other countries also could reduce the net price we receive for our products.\nWe are subject to regulations regarding the manufacturing of therapeutic proteins and, if we are unable to comply, or if we or any third party provider fails to provide sufficient quantities of material, we may experience delays and incur additional costs.\nWe and our third party suppliers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, corresponding state agencies or non-U.S. regulatory authorities to ensure strict compliance with cGMPs and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. The cGMP requirements govern manufacturing, quality control and documentation policies and procedures. Complying with cGMP and non-U.S. regulatory requirements will require that we expend time, money, and effort in production, recordkeeping, and quality control to assure that the product candidate or any approved product meets applicable specifications and other requirements. We and our contract manufacturers and testing laboratories must also pass pre-approval inspections prior to regulatory approvals. Failure to pass a pre-approval inspection might significantly delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. If we or our contract manufacturers or testing laboratories fail to comply with these requirements, we would be subject to possible regulatory action and might be limited in the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell our products. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations might be materially harmed.\nWe currently manufacture the therapeutic protein product candidates that we are developing using both internal resources and external contract manufacturers; however, we have limited experience in manufacturing or procuring products in commercial quantities and our manufacturing system has never been utilized to produce a product approved by regulatory authorities for commercial use. We may not be able to manufacture enough product to conduct clinical trials or for later commercialization at an acceptable cost or at all. We may also experience shortages in supply of our products which would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and financial operations. We may not be able to produce, or sufficiently test comparable drug materials derived from different manufacturing facilities operating by us or from processes run by our third party manufacturing partners, which could impact our ability or timing with respect to receiving regulatory approval for our product candidates. In addition, a number of other factors could cause production interruptions at our facilities or the facilities of our third-party providers, including equipment malfunctions, facility or product contamination, labor problems, raw material shortages or contamination, natural disasters, disruption in utility services, terrorist activities, human error or disruptions in the operations of our suppliers. Our product candidates are biologics and are very difficult to manufacture. We employ multiple steps to attempt to control the manufacturing processes. Problems with these manufacturing processes, even minor deviations from the normal process, could result in product defects, contamination or manufacturing failures that result in lot failures, product recalls, product liability claims and insufficient material for clinical trials or commercial use. Certain of the raw materials required in the manufacturing and the formulation of our product candidates are derived from biological sources, including egg white and human serum albumin. Such raw materials are difficult to procure and may be subject to contamination or recall. Also, some countries in which we may operate could restrict the use of certain biologically derived substances in the manufacture of drugs. A material shortage, contamination, recall, or restriction on the use of certain biologically derived substances in the manufacture of our products could adversely impact or disrupt manufacturing or could result in a withdrawal of our product candidates or any approved products. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations might be materially harmed.\nOur current and anticipated future reliance on a limited number of third parties to complete the manufacturing process for our products exposes us to certain risks.\nWe currently rely on third parties to complete the manufacturing process, including purifying, finishing, filling, labeling and testing our products. We have recently entered into agreements with third parties related to these steps for the commercial supply of Kanuma, and as we do not have experience in producing Kanuma for commercial use, we may experience unanticipated delays or issues in this process. Our reliance on a limited number of third-party manufacturers exposes us to the following risks:\n\u2022\nWe might be unable to identify or enter into agreements with manufacturers for clinical or commercial supply on acceptable terms or at all because the number of potential manufacturers is limited and the FDA and other regulatory authorities must approve any replacement contractor. This approval would generally require new testing and compliance inspections. In addition, a new manufacturer would have to be educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, production of our products prior to receipt of FDA approval, if any.\n\u2022\nOur third-party manufacturers might be unable to formulate and manufacture the relevant drugs in the volume and of the quality required to meet our clinical and commercial needs, if any.\n\u2022\nOur third-party contract manufacturers might not perform as agreed or might not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply possible clinical trials or to successfully produce, store and distribute our products.\n\u2022\nDrug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by regulatory authorities, corresponding state agencies and non-U.S. regulatory authorities to ensure strict compliance with cGMP, and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have complete or direct control over third-party manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards.\n\u2022\nIf any third-party manufacturer makes improvements in the manufacturing process for the relevant products, we might not own, or might have to share, the intellectual property rights to the innovation with our licensors.\n\u2022\nWe might compete with other companies for access to these manufacturers\u2019 facilities and might be subject to manufacturing delays if the manufacturers give other clients higher priority than us.\nEach of these risks could delay our clinical trials or the approval, if any, of our product candidates by the FDA or the commercialization of our product candidates and could result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenues. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations might be materially harmed.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, if we are unable to successfully develop internal and external commercialization capabilities, we will be unable to successfully commercialize them.\nWe currently have limited internal capabilities for the commercialization of any product candidates that may be approved. In order to commercialize a product if approved, we must develop our sales, marketing, contracting, distribution and reimbursement capabilities. We will need to commit significant time and financial and managerial resources to develop a medical affairs team, a marketing and sales force with technical expertise, and sufficient distribution capabilities.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to develop our commercialization capabilities include:\n\u2022\nour inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective medical and commercial personnel or manage a potential substantial increase in our number of full-time employees in a short period;\n\u2022\nour inability to train sales personnel, who may have limited experience with us or our future products, to deliver a consistent message regarding the underlying disease that complies with regulatory requirements and be effective (after regulatory approval) in convincing physicians to prescribe our future products;\n\u2022\nour inability to equip medical and sales personnel with effective materials, including medical and sales literature to help them educate physicians and other healthcare providers regarding applicable rare diseases and our future products;\n\u2022\nour inability to develop or obtain sufficient operational functions to support our commercial activities; and\n\u2022\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating and sustaining an independent sales and marketing organization.\nIf we are not successful in building a medical affairs and sales, marketing and other commercial infrastructure, we will have difficulty commercializing any future products, which would adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, we plan to rely on third parties to help distribute our future products to patients. We expect that we will need to contract with third-party logistics companies to warehouse and distribute any approved products, and coordinate prescription intake and distribution, reimbursement adjudication, patient financial support, and ongoing compliance support. This distribution network will require significant coordination with our sales and marketing and finance organizations. If we are unable to effectively establish and manage the distribution process, the commercial launch and sales of any future products we may commercialize, will be delayed or severely compromised and our results of operations may be harmed.\nWe may be subject, directly or indirectly, to healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, and health information privacy and security laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties and it could affect our ability to develop, market and sell our potential products.\nOur operations may be directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, and physician sunshine laws and regulations. The laws and regulations concerning promotion and marketing of drug products and dialogistic tests may impact, among other things, our disease awareness and education programs, as well as our proposed sales and marketing activities for any of our products that might receive regulatory approval, including Kanuma. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not necessarily limited to:\n\u2022\nfederal healthcare program anti-kickback law, which prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual for a healthcare item or service, or the purchasing or ordering of an item or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid;\n\u2022\nfederal false claims law, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented, claims for payment by government funded programs such as Medicare or Medicaid that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to us by virtue of statements and representations made to customers or third parties;\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, which prohibit executing a scheme to defraud healthcare programs; impose requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and require notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nthe federal physician sunshine requirements under the health care reform laws requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations; and\n\u2022\nstate laws comparable to each of the above federal laws, such as, for example, anti-kickback and false claims laws applicable to commercial insurers and other non-federal payors, requirements for mandatory corporate regulatory compliance programs, and laws relating to patient data privacy and security. Similar strict restrictions are imposed on the promotion and marketing of drug products in the EU and other countries. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of drug products in the EU could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. In addition, many countries have strict data privacy laws and violators could be subject to administrative measures and fines.\nInteractions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians\u2019 codes of professional conduct in the individual EU member states. The provision of any inducements to physicians to prescribe, recommend, endorse, order, purchase, supply, use\nor administer a drug product is prohibited. A number of EU member states have introduced additional rules requiring pharmaceutical companies to publicly disclose their interactions with physicians and to obtain approval from employers, professional organizations and/or competent authorities before entering into agreements with physicians. Violations of these rules could lead to the imposition of fines or imprisonment.\nLaws, including those governing promotion, marketing and anti-kickback provisions, industry regulations and professional codes of conduct are often strictly enforced. Increasing regulatory scrutiny of the promotional activities of pharmaceutical companies has been observed in the U.S. and a number of EU member states. We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other anti-corruption laws and regulations pertaining to our efforts in this area. For example, the Bribery Act in the United Kingdom entered into force in July 2011 applies to any company incorporated in or \u201ccarrying on business\u201d in the United Kingdom, regardless of the country in which the alleged bribery activity occurs and even if the inappropriate activity is undertaken by our international distribution partners.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property and Orphan Drug Exclusivity\nIf we infringe the rights of third parties we might have to forgo selling our future products, pay damages, or defend litigation.\nIf our product candidates, methods, processes, or other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and might have to:\n\u2022\nobtain rights or licenses from such third parties, which might not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\nabandon an infringing product candidate;\n\u2022\nredesign products or processes to avoid infringement;\n\u2022\nstop using the subject matter claimed in the patents held by others;\n\u2022\npay damages; and/or\n\u2022\nengage in litigation or administrative proceedings which might be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of financial and management resources.\nAny of these events could substantially harm our earnings, financial condition, and operations.\nOur business depends on protecting our intellectual property.\nWe and our licensors are pursuing intellectual property protection for Kanuma and other product candidates in the form of patent applications that have been and will continue to be filed in the U.S. and in other countries; however, there can be no assurance that patents will issue with the scope for which they are originally filed, if at all.\nIf we and our licensors do not obtain protection for our respective intellectual property rights and our products are not, or are no longer, protected by regulatory exclusivity protection, such as orphan drug protection, our competitors might be able to develop and commercialize competing drugs.\nOur success, competitive position, and future revenues, if any, depend in part on our ability and the abilities of our licensors to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products, methods, processes, and other technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights, and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. We currently hold various issued patents and exclusive licenses to issued patents and own and have exclusive licenses to various patent applications, in each case in the U.S. as well as rights under foreign patents and patent applications. We anticipate filing additional patent applications both in the U.S. and in other countries, as appropriate. However, the patent process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting our products by obtaining and defending patents. These risks and uncertainties include the following:\n\u2022\nour patent rights might be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or otherwise might not provide any competitive advantage;\n\u2022\nour competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than we do and many of which might make significant investments in competing technologies, might seek, or might already have obtained, patents that will limit, interfere with, make obsolete, or eliminate our ability to make, use, and sell our potential products either in the U.S. or in international markets;\n\u2022\ngovernments may adopt regulations requiring compulsory licensing of IP rights, and governments or courts may render decisions enforcing those regulations;\n\u2022\nas a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns, there might be significant pressure on the U.S. government and other international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the U.S. for disease treatments that prove successful; and\n\u2022\ncountries other than the U.S. might have less restrictive patent laws than the U.S., giving foreign competitors the ability to exploit these laws to create, develop, and market competing products.\nIn addition, the USPTO and patent offices in other jurisdictions have often required that patent applications concerning pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology-related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application, thereby limiting the scope of protection against competitive challenges. Thus, even if we or our licensors are able to obtain patents, the patents might be substantially narrower than anticipated.\nPatent and other intellectual property protection is crucial to the success of our business and prospects, and there is a risk that such protections will prove inadequate. Our business and prospects might be materially harmed if these protections prove insufficient.\nOn September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The USPTO has issued regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, but many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act have only recently become effective. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe rely on trade secret protections through confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties, and the breach of these agreements could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nWe rely on trade secrets, which we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, collaborators, suppliers, and other parties. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any such breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by our competitors. We might be involved from time to time in litigation to determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of our proprietary rights. Any such litigation could result in substantial cost and divert management\u2019s attention from operations. If any of these events occurs, or we otherwise lose protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, the value of this information may be greatly reduced.\nWe are dependent on certain license relationships.\nWe have licensed technology that is related to our proprietary expression technology from the University of Georgia, University of Minnesota and Pangenix. In addition, we obtained exclusive worldwide rights to multiple patents and patent applications relating to the use of LAL for the treatment of LAL Deficiency and atherosclerosis from Shire Human Genetics Therapies, Inc. and its affiliates and Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Research Foundation. We might enter into additional licenses in the future. Licenses to which we are a party contain, and we expect that any future licenses will contain, provisions requiring up-front, milestone, and royalty payments to licensors and other conditions to maintaining the license rights. If we fail to comply with our obligations under any such license, the applicable licensor may have the right to terminate the license on relatively short notice and as a result, we may not be able to commercialize product candidates or technologies that were covered by the applicable license. Also, the milestone and other payments associated with these licenses will make it less profitable for us to develop our product candidates.\nWe expect to rely on orphan drug exclusivity for Kanuma and SBC-103. A competitor may receive orphan drug marketing authorization prior to us for the same indication for which we are seeking approval.\nApproval of Kanuma and SBC-103 as orphan drugs would grant us seven years of marketing exclusivity under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and up to 10 years of marketing exclusivity in Europe. While the orphan drug designation for Kanuma and SBC-103 will provide market exclusivity in the U.S., Europe and Japan, we will not be able to rely on market exclusivity to prevent other companies from obtaining regulatory approval in these territories for the same active ingredient for the same indication beyond that timeframe. Furthermore, the marketing exclusivity in Europe can be reduced from 10 years to six years if the initial designation criteria have significantly changed since the market authorization of the orphan drug or orphan exclusivity may be revoked if we cannot reliably supply the market. Even if we have orphan drug designation for a particular drug indication, we cannot guarantee that another company also with orphan drug designation will not receive marketing authorization for the same indication before we do. If that were to happen, our applications for that indication may not be approved until the competing company\u2019s period of exclusivity has expired. Also, we cannot guarantee that another company with orphan drug designation will not receive marketing authorization for the same indication at the same time we do. In this case, both companies would receive market exclusivity, which could have a material adverse effect on sales in that market. Even if we are the first to obtain marketing authorization for an orphan drug indication, there are circumstances under which a competing product may be approved for the same indication during the seven-year period of marketing exclusivity in the U.S., such as if the later product is shown to be clinically superior to our product, or if the later product is a different drug than Kanuma or SBC-103. Further, the seven-year marketing exclusivity in the U.S. would not prevent competitors from obtaining approval of the same compound for other indications or the use of other types of drugs for the same use as the orphan drug.\nRisks Related to our Business Operations and Industry\nWe face significant competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our competitors include organizations such as major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies and specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies. Many competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, such as larger research and development staff, more extensive marketing, distribution, sales and manufacturing organizations and experience, more extensive clinical trial and regulatory experience, expertise in prosecution of intellectual property rights and access to development resources like personnel and technology. As a result, these companies may develop or improve existing technologies that make our manufacturing technology or product candidates obsolete or they may obtain regulatory approval more rapidly than we are able to and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products.\nIf we are unable to retain and recruit qualified scientists and advisors, or if any of our key executives, key employees or key consultants discontinues his or her employment or consulting relationship with us, it may delay our development efforts or otherwise harm our business.\nThe loss of any of our key executives, employees or key consultants could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercial objectives. Furthermore, recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel to perform research and development work in the future is critical to our success. We must also recruit and retain personnel experienced in manufacturing, marketing, selling, distributing, supporting and otherwise commercializing approved therapeutic products. We may be unable to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among biotechnology, biopharmaceutical, and health care companies, universities, and non-profit research institutions for experienced scientists and other disciplines. Competition for employees may impact our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future. Certain of our officers, directors, scientific advisors, and/or consultants may from time to time serve as officers, directors, scientific advisors, and/or consultants of other biopharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d insurance policies on any of our officers or employees. We currently have employment contracts with our Chief Executive Officer, Sanj K. Patel, and other executive officers which provide for certain severance benefits. Consistent with our current employment policies, all of our employees are employed \u201cat will\u201d and, therefore, each employee may leave our employment at any time. If\nwe are unable to retain our existing employees, including qualified scientific personnel, and attract additional qualified candidates, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. We are not aware of any key personnel who intend to retire or otherwise leave us in the near future.\nWe may pursue rapid expansion of our workforce or diversify our business strategy through mergers, acquisitions, licensing arrangements or other contractual arrangements with third parties which may require substantial resources and substantial amounts of time from members of our senior management and involve numerous risks.\nWe may spend substantial resources to hire additional employees or pursue acquisitions of new technologies or businesses that we would expect to be complementary to our current technologies or business focus through mergers, acquisitions, licensing arrangements or other contractual arrangements with third parties. Acquisitions of technologies, companies or product rights involve numerous risks, including potential difficulties in the integration of acquired operations such as retaining key employees of an acquired business, integrating research and development programs, not meeting financial objectives, increased costs, undisclosed liabilities not covered by insurance or terms of acquisition, and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources in connection with an acquisition. We cannot ensure that we will be successful in identifying, executing, and integrating acquisitions in the future.\nIf we fail to manage projected growth, our results and operations may be adversely affected.\nWith our growth and preparation for a potential commercial launch of Kanuma for the treatment of LAL Deficiency and the continued progress of our preclinical-stage programs, we will be required to retain existing and add required new qualified and experienced personnel in the commercial, regulatory, manufacturing, quality, program management, clinical and medical areas over the next several years. Also, as our preclinical pipeline diversifies through internal discoveries, or the acquisition or in-licensing of new molecules, we will need to hire additional scientists to supplement our existing scientific expertise over the next several years.\nOur staff, financial resources, systems, procedures or controls may be inadequate to support our expanding operations and our management may be unable to take advantage of future market opportunities or manage successfully our relationships with third parties if we are unable to adequately manage our anticipated growth and the integration of new personnel.\nOur operations are subject to the economic, political, legal and business conditions in the countries in which we do business, and our failure to operate successfully or adapt to changes in these conditions could cause our operations to be limited or disrupted.\nWe have expanded our operations outside of the United States and expect to continue to do so in the future. Our current operations in foreign countries subject us to certain risks that could cause our operations to be limited or disrupted, including volatility in international economies, inflation, political instability, difficulties enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights, changes in laws, regulations or enforcement practices with respect to our business, compliance with tax, privacy, employment and labor laws, costs and difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified managers and employees to manage and operate the business in local jurisdictions and costs and difficulties in managing and monitoring international operations.\nWe are exposed to product liability and preclinical and clinical liability risks which could place a substantial financial burden upon us, should we be sued, if we do not have adequate liability insurance or general insurance coverage for such a claim.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of products like ours. Foreign regulations or clinical sites may require us, as sponsor, to be liable for medical outcomes even if an adverse event is not directly related to our product candidate. In addition, the use in our clinical trials of pharmaceutical formulations and products that our potential collaborators may develop and the subsequent sale of these formulations or products by us or our potential collaborators may cause us to bear a portion or all of the product liability risks. As is common for companies sponsoring such clinical testing, we carry\nproduct liability insurance. This insurance may in some instances may be insufficient to offset a negative judgment or settlement payment. As a result, a successful liability claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and data about our patients, suppliers, and business partners, and personally identifiable information. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation which could adversely affect our business.\nIf we do not achieve our projected development and commercialization goals in the time frames we expect and announce, the credibility of our management and our organizational competence may be adversely affected.\nFor planning purposes, we estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific, preclinical, clinical, regulatory, market launch and commercialization goals, which we sometimes refer to as milestones. These milestones may include the commencement or completion of scientific, preclinical and clinical studies, the submission of regulatory filings and eventual product launch.\nFrom time to time, we may publicly announce the estimated timing of some of these milestones. All of these milestones will be based on a variety of assumptions. The actual timing of these milestones can vary dramatically compared to our estimates, in many cases for reasons beyond our control. For example, clinical trials may be delayed due to factors such as regulatory agency approval, institutional review board approvals, qualification of clinical sites, scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions and the rate of patient enrollment. In most circumstances, we rely on academic institutions, major medical institutions, governmental research organizations (U.S. or internationally based), clinical research organizations or contract manufacturing organizations to conduct, supervise or monitor some or all aspects of clinical trials involving our product candidates. We will have limited control over the timing and other aspects of these clinical trials.\nIf we do not meet the milestones as publicly announced (or as projected by various analysts who follow us), our stockholders or potential stockholders may lose confidence in our ability to meet overall product development and commercialization goals and, as a result, the price of our common stock may decline.\nOur success will depend in part on relationships with third parties. Any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur success will be dependent on our ability to maintain and renew business relationships with third parties and to establish new business relationships. There can be no assurance that our management will be able to maintain such business relationships, or enter into or maintain new business contracts and other business relationships, on acceptable terms, if at all. The failure to maintain important business relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur charter documents and indemnification agreements require us to indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law, which may obligate us to make substantial payments and to incur significant insurance-related expenses.\nOur charter documents require us to indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law. This could require us, with some legally prescribed exceptions, to indemnify our directors and officers against any and all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines, and amounts reasonably paid in defense or settlement of an action, suit, or proceeding brought against any of them by reason of the fact that he or she is or was our director or officer. In addition,\nexpenses incurred by a director or officer in defending any such action, suit, or proceeding must be paid by us in advance of the final disposition of that action, suit or proceeding if we receive an undertaking by the director or officer to repay us if it is ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and officers. In furtherance of these indemnification obligations, we maintain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance in the amount of $30,000,000. For future renewals, if we are able to retain coverage, we may be required to pay a higher premium for our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance than in the past and/or the amount of its insurance coverage may be decreased.\nRisks Related to FUZEON Revenue\nWe derive a significant portion of our income from royalties on sales of FUZEON. If FUZEON sales continue to decline, our business could suffer.\nRoyalties on sales of FUZEON are currently a significant source of revenue for us. FUZEON competes with numerous existing therapies for the treatment of HIV. From 2010 through 2014, overall FUZEON net sales reported by Roche have shown a general declining trend, from $88.4 million in 2010 to $39.1 million in 2014. We cannot predict if or when sales levels for FUZEON will stabilize.\nUncertainties relating to third-party reimbursement and health care reform measures could limit payments or reimbursements for FUZEON, which could adversely affect our business.\nCurrently, because of the high cost of the treatment of HIV, many state legislatures are reassessing reimbursement policies for this therapy. If third-party payor reimbursements for FUZEON are limited or reduced, our results of operations will be adversely affected. In addition, emphasis in the U.S. on the reduction of the overall costs of health care through managed care has increased and will continue to increase the pressure to reduce the prices of pharmaceutical products.\nThe wholesale acquisition cost of a one-year supply of FUZEON in the U.S. is approximately $35,000. A high drug price could also negatively affect patients\u2019 ability to receive reimbursement coverage for FUZEON from third-party payors, such as private or government insurance programs. If Roche is unable to obtain and maintain reimbursement from a significant number of third-party payors, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCurrently, FUZEON is covered by Medicaid in all 50 states in the U.S. In addition, the AIDS Drug Assistance Programs in all 50 states and a majority of private insurers provide some amount of access to FUZEON. However, there are reimbursement challenges remaining. Some of the payors require patients to meet minimum medical requirements, such as maintaining certain cell levels associated with HIV, to receive reimbursement. Other payors limit the number of patients to which they will provide reimbursement for FUZEON, and other payors may require co-payments by the patient in order to receive reimbursement for FUZEON that are significantly higher than those required for other anti-HIV drugs.\nSeveral major pharmaceutical companies have offered to sell their anti-HIV drugs at or below cost to certain countries in Africa and Least Developed Countries (as defined by the United Nations), which could adversely affect the reimbursement climate of, and the prices that may be charged for, HIV medications in the U.S. and the rest of the world. Third-party payors could exert pressure for price reductions in the U.S. and the rest of the world based on these lower costs offered in Africa and Least Developed Countries. This price pressure could limit the price that Roche would be able to charge for FUZEON, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations.\nIf the sale of FUZEON infringes the proprietary rights of third parties, we may need to obtain licenses, pay damages or defend litigation.\nIf the sale of FUZEON infringes the proprietary rights of third parties, we could incur substantial costs and may have to:\n\u2022\nobtain licenses, which might not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\npay damages; and/or\n\u2022\nengage in litigation or administrative proceedings which might be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of financial and management resources.\nAny of these events could substantially harm our earnings, financial condition, and operations.\nOn November 20, 2007, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, Inc. (Novartis) filed a lawsuit against us and Roche and certain of its affiliated entities, alleging infringement of Novartis\u2019s U.S. Patent No. 7,285,271 (the 271 Patent), related to the manufacture, sale and offer for sale of FUZEON. On September 23, 2010, we entered into a settlement agreement (the Settlement Agreement) with Roche and Novartis settling the lawsuit and the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice from the Eastern District of North Carolina on September 28, 2010. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, we, in collaboration with Roche, have the right to continue to sell FUZEON under a license to the 271 Patent in exchange for the payment of royalties to Novartis on net sales of FUZEON. We will share responsibility for payment of these royalties equally with Roche.\nWe rely on Roche to timely deliver important financial information relating to sales of FUZEON. In the event that this information is inaccurate, incomplete, or not timely, we will not be able to meet our financial reporting obligations as required by the SEC.\nUnder the Amended and Restated Agreement by and between Roche and Trimeris, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1993 (Trimeris), effective as of January 1, 2011 (the Roche License Agreement), Roche has exclusive control over the flow of information relating to sales of FUZEON that we require to meet our SEC reporting obligations. Roche is required under the Roche License Agreement to provide us with timely and accurate financial data related to sales of FUZEON so that we may meet our reporting requirements under federal securities laws. In the event that Roche fails to provide us with timely and accurate information, we may incur significant liability with respect to the federal securities laws, our disclosure controls and procedures under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) may be inadequate, and we may be forced to restate our financial statements, any of which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nWe may be unable to raise the substantial additional capital that we will need to further develop and commercialize our products.\nAs is typical of biotechnology companies at our stage of development, our operations consume substantial amounts of cash and we will need substantial additional funds to further develop and commercialize our products.\nWhile we will need to seek additional funding, we may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, the terms of our financings may be dilutive to, or otherwise adversely affect, holders of our common stock. We may also seek additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or other third parties. These arrangements would generally require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies, product candidates or products, and we may not be able to enter into such agreements, on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis, we may be required to curtail or terminate some or all of our development programs, including some or all of our product candidates.\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We are a company with limited historical revenues, which makes it difficult to assess our future viability.\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. Biopharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. We have incurred significant losses since our inception, and at December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $446.9 million. We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our efforts to seek approval for and commercialize Kanuma and our research and development of our other product candidates, including but not limited to, SBC-103 and SBC-105. As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations for the foreseeable future. If any of our product candidates fail in clinical trials or do not gain regulatory approval, or if any of our product candidates, if approved, fail to achieve market acceptance, we may never become profitable. Even if\nwe achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carry forwards to reduce future tax payments may be limited if there is or has been a change in ownership of Synageva, or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels\nUtilization of our net operating loss (NOL) and research and development (R&D) credit carry forwards to reduce future tax payments depends in part on whether taxable income reaches sufficient levels prior to the expiration of these deferred tax assets. Our federal NOL carryforwards begin to expire in 2018 and our state NOL carryforwards began to expire in 2014. We have federal orphan drug credits and federal and state research tax credit carryforwards, which begin expiring in 2018 and 2023, respectively. Utilization of these deferred tax assets also may be subject to a substantial annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) due to ownership change limitations that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. These ownership changes may limit the amount of NOL and R&D credit carry forwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. As part of the merger of Trimeris and Synageva BioPharma Corp., a privately held Delaware corporation in 2011, we acquired federal tax attributes that are significantly limited under Section 382 of the Code.\nA valuation allowance of $185.2 million and $128.8 million has been established at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, to offset our potential deferred tax assets.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities which could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nAs a result of our international operations, we are subject to income taxes, as well as non-income based taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide tax liabilities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate outcome with respect to the taxes we owe may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements. If the Internal Revenue Service, or other taxing authority, disagrees with the positions we take, we could have additional tax liability, and this could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, the United States government and other governments are considering and may adopt tax reform measures that significantly increase our worldwide tax liabilities which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur management is required to devote substantial time to comply with public company regulations.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. Sarbanes-Oxley and rules implemented by the SEC and the NASDAQ Global Select Market impose various requirements on public companies, including those related to corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote substantial time to these requirements.\nSarbanes-Oxley requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley (Section 404). We will incur substantial accounting and related expenses to comply with Section 404. We may need to hire additional accounting and financial staff to satisfy the ongoing requirements of Section 404. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including the following factors:\n\u2022\nannouncements of preclinical, clinical or regulatory developments or technological innovations by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in our relationship with our licensors and other strategic partners;\n\u2022\nour quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\ndeclines in sales of FUZEON;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in patent or other technology ownership rights;\n\u2022\npublic concern regarding the safety of our products;\n\u2022\nadditional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us and, in the case of equity financings, may result in dilution to our stock holders;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulation of drug pricing; and\n\u2022\ngeneral changes in the economy, the financial markets or the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries.\nAdditional factors beyond our control may also have an impact on the price of our stock. For example, to the extent that other large companies within our industry experience declines in their stock price, our stock price may decline as well. In addition, when the market price of a company\u2019s common stock drops significantly, stockholders often institute securities class action lawsuits against the company. A lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management and other resources.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFuture sales into the public market of substantial amounts of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into shares of our common stock, including shares of our common stock issued upon exercise of options and warrants, or perceptions that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital in the future.\nOwnership of our common stock is highly concentrated, and it may prevent you and other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest that could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur executive officers and directors, together with their respective affiliates, beneficially own and control a significant portion of our common stock. Accordingly, these executive officers, directors and their affiliates, acting individually or as a group, have substantial influence over the outcome of a corporate action requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or any other significant corporate transaction. These stockholders may also exert influence in delaying or preventing a change in control, even if such change in control would benefit our other stockholders. In addition, the significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the market value of our common stock due to investors\u2019 perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws may prevent or frustrate attempts by stockholders to change the board of directors or current management and could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future.\nOur business requires significant funding, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have broad discretion in how we use our resources, and we may not use our cash and investments effectively or in ways with which you agree.\nOur management has broad discretion as to the application of our resources. Our stockholders may not agree with the manner in which our management chooses to allocate and spend our cash, cash equivalents and investments. Moreover, our management may use our resources for corporate purposes that may not increase the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 85511, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "GEVA"}
