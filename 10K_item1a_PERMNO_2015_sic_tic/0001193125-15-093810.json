{"cik": "1369786", "company": "Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should read the following risk factors carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition in the future.\nWe rely on our business partners for the manufacture of a significant portion of our products, and if our business partners fail to supply us with high-quality API or finished products in the quantities we require on a timely basis, sales of our products could be delayed or prevented, and our revenues and margins could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely upon our third-party business partners, principally located outside of the U.S., for the supply of all API and a significant portion of our finished products in our Sagent US segment. In most cases, we rely upon a limited number of business partners to supply us with the API or finished products for each of our products. If our business partners do not continue to provide these services or products to us we might not be able to obtain these services or products from others in a timely manner or on commercially acceptable terms. Likewise, if our business partners encounter delays or difficulties in producing API or our finished products, the distribution, marketing and subsequent sales of these products could be adversely affected. If, for any reason, our business partners are unable to obtain or deliver sufficient quantities of API or finished products on a timely basis or we develop any significant disagreements with our business partners, the manufacture or supply of our products could be disrupted, which may decrease our sales revenue, increase our operating expenses or otherwise negatively impact our operations. In addition, if we are unable to engage and retain business partners for the supply of API or finished product manufacturing on commercially acceptable terms, we may not be able to sell our products as planned.\nSubstantially all of our products are sterile injectable pharmaceuticals. The manufacture of our products is highly exacting and complex and we or our business partners may experience problems during the manufacture of API or finished products for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, manufacturing quality concerns, problems with raw materials, natural disaster related events or other environmental factors. In addition, the manufacture of certain API that we require for our products or the finished products require dedicated facilities and we may rely on a limited number or, in most cases, single vendors for these products and services. If problems arise during the production, storage or distribution of a batch of product, that batch of product may have to be discarded. If we are unable to find alternative qualified sources of API or finished products, this could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost sales, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending upon the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to market, voluntary recalls, corrective actions or product liability related costs may also be incurred. For example, in February 2015, we initiated a voluntary recall of certain lots of a critical care product manufactured since February 2014 due to FDA observations regarding aseptic and GMP practices at our partner\u2019s manufacturing site, and in March 2014 we initiated a voluntary recall of all lots of an oncology product that we sold from October 2013 through the date of recall due to the discovery of four leaking premix bags detected during an investigation conducted in response to a product complaint. Problems with respect to the manufacture, storage or distribution of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile large finished product manufacturers have historically purchased API from foreign manufacturers and then manufactured and packaged the finished product in their own facility, recent growth in the number of foreign manufacturers capable of producing high-quality finished products at low cost have provided these finished product manufacturers opportunities to outsource the manufacturing of their products at lower costs than manufacturing such products in their own facilities. If the large finished product manufacturers continue to shift production from their own facilities to companies that we contract with to provide product development services, API or finished product manufacturing, we may experience added competition in obtaining these services which we rely upon to meet our customers\u2019 demands.\nIf we or any of our business partners are unable to comply with the quality and regulatory standards applicable to pharmaceutical drug manufacturers, or if approvals of pending applications are not granted or are delayed we may be unable to meet the demand for our products, may lose potential revenues and our business, financial position and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nAll of our business partners who supply us with API or finished products as well as our owned manufacturing facilities are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S., Canada and in other countries. Regulatory approval to manufacture a drug is site-specific. Both our and our suppliers\u2019 facilities and procedures are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodic inspection by the FDA and other relevant regulatory agencies. Following an inspection, an agency may issue a notice listing conditions that are believed to violate current good manufacturing practice (\u201ccGMP\u201d) or other regulations, or a warning letter for violations of \u201cregulatory significance\u201d that may result in enforcement action if not promptly and adequately cured. If any regulatory body were to require us or one of our business partners to cease or limit production, our business could be adversely affected.\nIn the event of any such regulatory action, identifying alternative vendors and obtaining regulatory approval to change or substitute API or a manufacturer of a finished product can be time consuming and expensive. Any resulting delays and costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. We cannot assure you that we or our business partners will not be subject to such regulatory action in the future.\nThe FDA and other relevant regulatory agencies have the authority to revoke drug approvals previously granted and remove from the market previously approved products for various reasons, including issues related to cGMP.\nWe may be subject from time to time to product recalls initiated by us or by the FDA or other regulatory agencies. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, the revocation of prior approvals, or product recalls could impose significant costs on us and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue.\nFurthermore, violations by us or our business partners of U.S. or other governmental regulations and other regulatory requirements could subject us to, among other things:\n\u2022\nwarning letters;\n\u2022\nfines and civil penalties;\n\u2022\ntotal or partial suspension of production or sales;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure or recall;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of product approval; and\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecution.\nAny of these or any other regulatory action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nIn September 2013, a facility owned by Agila received a warning letter from the FDA related to the FDA inspection of Agila\u2019s Specialty Formulation Facility (\u201cSFF\u201d) in Bangalore, India. The warning letter identified violations of cGMP related to the prevention of microbiological contamination of sterile drug products and systems to monitor environmental conditions in aseptic processing. The warning letter also described other deficiencies in the quality management function of SFF. The warning letter stated that new drug applications may not be approved until the facility has completed and the FDA has confirmed the remediation efforts and compliance with cGMP. Delays in the approval of the six Sagent Agila ANDAs currently being reviewed by the FDA, or limitations on the importation of products from the SFF facility, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe maintain our own in-house quality assurance and facility compliance teams that inspect, assess and qualify our and our business partners\u2019 facilities, work to ensure that the facilities and the products manufactured in those facilities are cGMP compliant, and provide support for product launches and regulatory agency facility inspections. Despite these comprehensive efforts and our and our suppliers\u2019 extensive quality systems, we cannot assure you that our business partners will adhere to our quality standards or that our compliance teams will be successful in ensuring that our business partners\u2019 or our own facilities and the products manufactured in those facilities will be cGMP compliant. If any of our business partners fail to comply with our quality standards, or if our facilities do not comply with cGMP requirements, our ability to compete may be significantly impaired and our business, financial position and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nAny change in the regulations, enforcement procedures or regulatory policies established by the FDA and other regulatory agencies could increase the costs or time of development of our products and delay or prevent sales of our products and our revenues could decline and, as a result, our business, financial position and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur products generally must receive appropriate regulatory clearance from the FDA or relevant regulatory agencies before they can be sold. Any change in the regulations, enforcement procedures or regulatory policies set by the FDA and other regulatory agencies could increase the costs or time of development of our products and delay or prevent sales of our products. For instance, beginning in June 2014, the FDA required new ANDA submissions to include enhanced documentation. We cannot determine what effect further changes in\nregulations, statutes, legal interpretation or policies, when and if promulgated, enacted or adopted, may have on our business in the future. Such changes could, among other things, require:\n\u2022\nchanges to manufacturing methods;\n\u2022\nexpanded or different labeling;\n\u2022\nrecall, replacement or discontinuance of certain products;\n\u2022\nadditional record keeping; and\n\u2022\nchanges in methods to determine bio-equivalents\nSuch changes, or new legislation, could increase the costs of, delay or prevent sales of our products and, as a result, our business, financial position and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, increases in the time that is required for us to obtain approval of regulatory submissions could delay our commercialization of new products. Approval times in the U.S. could continue to increase as a result of the upcoming expiration of the U.S. patents covering a number of key injectable pharmaceutical products. No assurance can be given that our regulatory submissions will receive approval on a timely basis, if at all, nor can we estimate the timing of approvals with any reasonable degree of certainty.\nA relatively small group of products supplied by a limited number of our vendors represents a significant portion of our net revenue. If the volume or pricing of any of these products declines, or we are unable to satisfy market demand for these products, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nSales of a limited number of our products collectively represent a significant portion of our consolidated net revenue. If the volume or pricing of our largest selling products declines in the future or we are unable to satisfy market demand for these products, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Should market prices of any of our products decline more rapidly than anticipated, our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nTwo of our products, heparin and levofloxacin in premix bags, collectively accounted for approximately 28% and 37% of our consolidated net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2012, respectively, while three of our products, heparin, levofloxacin in premix bags and zoledronic acid vials accounted for approximately 46% of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013. Our ten largest products accounted for approximately 69%, 70% and 70% of our consolidated net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We expect that our heparin and levofloxacin in premix bag products will continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable future.\nThese and our other key products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\npricing actions by competitors;\n\u2022\ndevelopment by others of new pharmaceutical products that are more effective than ours;\n\u2022\nentrance of new competitors into our markets;\n\u2022\nloss of key relationships with suppliers, GPOs or end-user customers;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing or supply interruptions;\n\u2022\nchanges in the prescribing practices of physicians;\n\u2022\nchanges in third-party reimbursement practices;\n\u2022\nproduct liability claims; and\n\u2022\nproduct recalls or safety alerts.\nAny factor adversely affecting the sale of our key products may cause our revenues to decline, and our business, financial position and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIn March 2013, we entered an agreement with Actavis to terminate our Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, effective December 31, 2014. In the aggregate, products sourced from Actavis accounted for approximately 19%, 18% and 11% of our consolidated net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We have been unable to successfully replace the supply of certain products supplied by Actavis, including docetaxel, on commercially reasonable terms prior to the expiration of our agreement. The products which have not been replaced represented approximately 8% of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIn addition, we currently rely on single vendors to supply us with API and finished product manufacturing with respect to heparin and levofloxacin in a premix bag. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with these business partners on commercially acceptable terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nOur markets are highly competitive and, if we are unable to compete successfully, our revenues could decline and our business, financial position and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nThe injectable pharmaceutical market is highly competitive. Our competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and generic drug companies. Our principal competitors include Fresenius, Hospira, Pfizer, Sandoz, Teva and West-Ward. In most cases, these competitors have access to greater financial, marketing, technical and other resources than we do. As a result, they may be able to devote more resources to the development, manufacture, marketing and sale of their products, receive a greater share of the capacity from API suppliers and finished product manufacturers, obtain more support from independent distributors, initiate or withstand substantial price competition or more readily take advantage of acquisition or other growth opportunities.\nThe generic segment of the injectable pharmaceutical market is characterized by a high level of price competition, as well as other competitive factors including reliability of supply, quality and enhanced product features. To the extent that any of our competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor, our business, results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. Pricing pressure could arise from, among other things, limited demand growth or a significant number of additional competitive products being introduced into a particular product market, price reductions by competitors, the ability of competitors to capitalize on their economies of scale and create excess product supply, the ability of competitors to produce or otherwise secure API and/or finished products at lower costs than what we are required to pay to our business partners under our manufacturing agreements and the access of competitors to new technology that we do not possess.\nThe generic injectable pharmaceutical market has experienced a number of significant merger and acquisition transactions that are driving consolidation in the markets in which we compete. Such consolidations may create larger companies with which we must compete, eliminate actual or potential sources for API and finished products, reduce the number of vendors willing to supply us with products, and provide further pressure on prices, development activities or customer retention. The impact of consolidation in the industry could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nIn addition to competition from established market participants, new entrants to the generic injectable pharmaceutical market could substantially reduce our market share, prevent us from attaining market share or\nrender our products obsolete. Most of our products are generic injectable versions of branded products. As patents for branded products and related exclusivity periods expire or are ruled invalid, the first generic pharmaceutical manufacturer to receive regulatory approval for a generic version of the reference product is generally able to achieve significant market penetration and higher margins on that product. As competing generic manufacturers receive regulatory approval of, and begin to market, this product, market share, revenue and gross profit typically decline for the original generic entrant. In addition, as more competitors enter a specific generic market, the average selling price per unit dose of the particular product typically declines for all competitors. Our ability to sustain our level of market share, revenue and gross profit attributable to a particular generic pharmaceutical product is significantly influenced by the number of competitors in that product\u2019s market and the timing of that product\u2019s regulatory approval and launch in relation to competing approvals and launches, as to which we have no control.\nBranded pharmaceutical companies often take aggressive steps to thwart competition from generic companies. The launch of our generic products could be delayed because branded drug manufacturers may, among other things:\n\u2022\nmake last minute modifications to existing product claims and labels, thereby requiring generic products to reflect this change prior to the drug being approved and introduced in the market;\n\u2022\nfile new patents for existing products prior to the expiration of a previously issued patent, which could extend patent protection for additional years;\n\u2022\nfile patent infringement suits that automatically delay for a specific period the approval of generic versions by the FDA or other regulatory bodies;\n\u2022\ndevelop and market their own generic versions of their products, either directly or through other generic pharmaceutical companies; and\n\u2022\nfile citizens\u2019 petitions with the FDA contesting generic approvals on alleged health and safety grounds.\nFurthermore, the FDA may grant a single generic manufacturer other than us a 180-day period of marketing exclusivity under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 as patents or other exclusivity periods for branded products expire.\nIf we are unable to continue to develop and commercialize new products in a timely and cost-effective manner, we may not achieve our expected revenue growth or profitability, or our business, results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.\nOur future success will depend to a significant degree on our ability to continue to develop and commercialize new products in a timely and cost-effective manner. The development and commercialization of new products is complex, time-consuming and costly and involves a high degree of business risk. As of December 31, 2014, we actively marketed 54 products in our Sagent US segment and 62 products in our Omega segment. Our US segment new product pipeline included 42 products represented by 64 ANDAs that we had filed, or licensed rights to, and were under review by the FDA, and four products represented by 15 ANDAs that have been recently approved by the FDA and are pending commercial launch. We had an additional 26 filings under review by regulatory agencies in our Omega segment, primarily in Canada, or under initial development. We may, however, encounter unexpected delays in the launch of these products, or these products, if and when fully commercialized by us, may not perform as we expect. For example, our pending regulatory filings may not receive approval on a timely basis, if at all.\nThe success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors, including our ability to anticipate customer needs, obtain timely regulatory approvals and locate and establish collaborations with suppliers of API, product development and finished product manufacturing in a timely and cost-effective manner. In addition, the development and commercialization of new products is characterized by significant up-front costs, including\ncosts associated with product development activities, sourcing API and manufacturing capability, obtaining regulatory approval, building inventory and sales and marketing. Furthermore, the development and commercialization of new products is subject to inherent risks, including the possibility that any new product may:\n\u2022\nfail to receive or encounter unexpected delays in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nbe difficult or impossible to manufacture on a large scale;\n\u2022\nbe uneconomical to market;\n\u2022\nfail to be developed prior to the successful marketing of similar or superior products by third parties; and\n\u2022\ninfringe on the proprietary rights of third parties.\nWe may not achieve our expected revenue growth or profitability or our business, results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected if we are not successful in continuing to develop and commercialize new products.\nIf we are unable to maintain our GPO relationships, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nMost of the end-users of injectable pharmaceutical products have relationships with GPOs whereby such GPOs provide such end-users access to a broad range of pharmaceutical products from multiple suppliers at competitive prices and, in certain cases, exercise considerable influence over the drug purchasing decisions of such end-users. Hospitals and other end-users contract with the GPO of their choice for their purchasing needs. We currently derive, and expect to continue to derive, a large percentage of our revenue from end-user customers that are members of a small number of GPOs. For example, the five largest U.S. GPOs represented end-user customers that collectively accounted for approximately 44%, 39% and 33% of our Sagent US segment net contract revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Maintaining our strong relationships with these GPOs will require us to continue to be a reliable supplier, offer a broad product line, remain price competitive, comply with FDA regulations and provide high-quality products. Although our GPO pricing agreements in both our Sagent US and Omega segments typically are multi-year in duration, most of them may be terminated by either party with 60 or 90 days notice. The GPOs with whom we have relationships may have relationships with manufacturers that sell competing products, and such GPOs may earn higher margins from these products or combinations of competing products or may prefer products other than ours for other reasons. If we are unable to maintain our GPO relationships, sales of our products and revenue could decline and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on a limited number of pharmaceutical wholesalers to distribute our products.\nAs is typical in the pharmaceutical industry, we rely upon pharmaceutical wholesalers in connection with the distribution of our products. A significant amount of our products are sold to end-users under GPO pricing arrangements through a limited number of pharmaceutical wholesalers. We currently derive, and expect to continue to derive, a large percentage of our sales through the three largest wholesalers in the U.S. market, Amerisource Bergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the products we sold through these wholesalers accounted for approximately 35%, 25% and 25%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenue. Collectively, our sales to these three wholesalers represented approximately 85%, 84% and 82% of our net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. If we are unable to maintain our business relationships with these major pharmaceutical wholesalers on commercially acceptable terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\nWe depend upon our key personnel, the loss of whom could adversely affect our operations. If we fail to attract and retain the talent required for our business, our business could be materially harmed.\nWe are a relatively small company and we depend to a significant degree on the principal members of our management and sales teams. The loss of services from our key employees may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development or business objectives. We have entered into employment agreements with certain of our key employees that contain restrictive covenants relating to non-competition and non-solicitation of our customers and employees for a period of 12 months after termination of employment. Nevertheless, each of our officers and key employees may terminate his or her employment at any time without notice and without cause or good reason, and so as a practical matter these agreements do not guarantee the continued service of these employees. Our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for qualified employees is intense, and the ability to attract and retain qualified individuals is critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain these individuals on acceptable terms or at all, and our inability to do so could significantly impair our ability to compete.\nOur inability to manage our planned growth or successfully integrate newly acquired businesses could harm our business.\nAs we expand our business we expect that our operating expenses and capital requirements will increase. As our product portfolio and product pipeline grow, we may require additional personnel on our project management, in-house quality assurance and facility compliance teams to work with our partners on quality assurance, cGMP compliance, regulatory affairs and product development. As a result, our operating expenses and capital requirements may increase significantly. In addition, we may encounter unexpected difficulties managing our worldwide network of relationships with API suppliers and finished product developers and manufacturers as we seek to expand such network in order to expand our product portfolio. Our ability to manage our growth effectively requires us to forecast accurately our sales growth and global manufacturing capacity and to expend funds to improve our operational, manufacturing financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.\nAdditionally, if we are unable to successfully integrate our recent acquisitions and achieve our expected efficiencies and synergies, our business could be harmed and our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The integration of international acquisitions can involve cultural, monetary and systems challenges among others. Our personnel, systems, procedures or controls may not be adequate to support both our ongoing business and the integration of newly acquired businesses.\nIf we are unable to manage our anticipated growth and the integration of newly acquired businesses effectively, our business could be harmed.\nWe may be exposed to product liability claims that could cause us to incur significant costs or cease selling some of our products.\nOur business inherently exposes us to claims for injuries allegedly resulting from the use of our products. We may be held liable for, or incur costs related to, liability claims if any of our products cause injury or are found unsuitable during development, manufacture, sale or use. These risks exist even with respect to products that have received, or may in the future receive, regulatory approval for commercial use. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our products;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\ninitiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u2022\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\na diversion of management\u2019s time and resources;\n\u2022\ncompensatory damages and fines;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue; and\n\u2022\nexhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources.\nOur product liability insurance may not be adequate and, at any time, insurance coverage may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. A product liability claim could result in liability to us greater than our insurance coverage or assets. Even if we have adequate insurance coverage, product liability claims or recalls could result in negative publicity or force us to devote significant time and attention to those matters or have a material adverse affect on our business.\nIf our products conflict with the intellectual property rights of third parties, we may incur substantial liabilities and we may be unable to commercialize products in a profitable manner or at all.\nWe seek to launch generic pharmaceutical products either where patent protection or other regulatory exclusivity of equivalent branded products has expired, where patents have been declared invalid or where products do not infringe on the patents of others. However, at times, we may seek approval to market generic products before the expiration of patents relating to the branded versions of those products, based upon our belief that such patents are invalid or otherwise unenforceable or would not be infringed by our products. Our success depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. The manufacture, use and sale of generic versions of products has been subject to substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical industry. These lawsuits relate to the validity and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of third parties. If our products were found to be infringing on the intellectual property rights of a third-party, we could be required to cease selling the infringing products, causing us to lose future sales revenue from such products and face substantial liabilities for patent infringement, in the form of either payment for the innovator\u2019s lost profits or a royalty on our sales of the infringing product. These damages may be significant and could materially adversely affect our business. Any litigation, regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, would be costly and time consuming and we could incur significant costs and/or a significant reduction in revenue in defending the action and from the resulting delays in manufacturing, marketing or selling any of our products subject to such claims.\nHealthcare reform legislation or other policy changes may adversely affect our business\nThe Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Acts make various changes to the delivery of healthcare in the U.S., including reductions in Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals, clinical laboratories and pharmaceutical companies, and could reduce the overall volume of medical procedures that are performed in the U.S. These factors, could, in turn, result in reduced demand for our products and increased downward pricing pressure on our products. Other provisions in the law may significantly change the practice of healthcare in the U.S., and could adversely impact our business. While the law is intended to expand health insurance coverage to uninsured persons in the U.S., the impact of any overall increase in access to healthcare on sales of our products remains uncertain.\nWe expect both federal and state governments in the U.S. and foreign governments to continue to propose and pass new legislation, rules and regulations designed to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare while expanding individual healthcare benefits. Existing regulations that affect the price of pharmaceutical and other medical products may also change before any of our products are approved for marketing. Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any product we develop in the future. In addition, third-party payors are\nincreasingly challenging the price and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved pharmaceutical products, including injectable products. Our products may not be considered cost effective, or adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize a return on our investments.\nIf reimbursement for our current or future products is reduced or modified, our business could suffer.\nSales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or are reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors. These healthcare management organizations and third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, as discussed above, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments in the U.S., and the prices of drugs and other healthcare products have been targeted in this effort. Accordingly, our current and potential products may not be considered cost effective, and reimbursement to the consumer may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis. Legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that are difficult to predict, and these changes may have a material adverse effect on our business. Any reduction in Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payor reimbursements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nIn Canada and certain other international markets, the government provides healthcare at low cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility or reimbursement levels to control costs for government-sponsored healthcare system. Many countries are currently reducing their public expenditures and we expect to continue to see strong efforts to reduce healthcare costs in international markets for the foreseeable future. In markets outside the U.S., our business could experience downward pressure on product pricing as a result of the concentrated buying power of governments as principal customers and the use of bid-and-tender sales methods whereby we are required to submit a bid for the sale of our products. The failure to offer acceptable prices to these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations outside the U.S.\nAny failure to comply with the complex reporting and payment obligations under Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs may result in litigation or sanctions.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws pertaining to foreign corrupt practices and healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, marketing and pricing laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. If there is a change in laws, regulations or administrative or judicial interpretations, we may have to change our business practices, or our existing business practices could be challenged as unlawful, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the event we change our business plan or encounter unexpected developments, which may cause dilution to our existing stockholders or restrict or limit our operations.\nWe may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect in the event we change our business plan, execute further strategic acquisitions, or encounter unexpected developments, including unforeseen competitive conditions within our markets, changes in the general economic climate, changes in the regulatory environment, the loss of key relationships with suppliers, GPOs or end-user customers or other unexpected developments that may have a material effect on the cash flows or results of operations of our business. If required, additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our ability to raise additional funding, if necessary, is subject to a variety of factors that we cannot predict with certainty, including our future results of operations, our relative levels of debt and equity, the volatility and overall condition of the\ncapital markets and the market prices of our securities. We may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings and collaboration arrangements. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. In addition, additional debt financing may only be available to us on less favorable terms than our revolving loan credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., (\u201cChase\u201d), including higher interest rates or greater exposure to interest rate risk. We may elect to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable.\nWe are subject to a number of risks associated with managing our international network of business relationships.\nWe have an international network of business relationships that includes 44 partners worldwide as of December 31, 2014, including 13 in the Americas, 12 in China and Taiwan, 11 in Europe, seven in India and one in the Middle East. As part of our business strategy, we intend to continue to identify further business relationships involving API sourcing, product development, finished product manufacturing and product licensing. We expect that a significant percentage of these new relationships will be with business partners located outside the U.S. Managing our existing and future international network of business relationships could impose substantial burdens on our resources, divert management\u2019s attention from other areas of our business and otherwise harm our business. In addition, our international network of relationships subjects us to certain risks, including:\n\u2022\nlegal uncertainties regarding, and timing delays associated with, tariffs, export licenses and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nincreased difficulty in operating across differing legal regimes, including resolving legal disputes that may arise between us and our business partners;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and effectively monitoring our business partners\u2019 facilities and operations across multiple geographic regions;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the U.S.;\n\u2022\nunfavorable tax or trade restrictions or currency calculations;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u2022\nchanges in diplomatic and trade relationships.\nAny of these or other factors could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our international network of business relationships and our operating results.\nWe may never realize the expected benefits from our manufacturing facility in China and it may require substantial additional capital resources.\nWe completed the purchase of the remaining equity interests in SCP from our former joint venture partner on June 4, 2013 at which time SCP became our wholly-owned subsidiary. SCP was established to construct and operate an FDA and cGMP compliant sterile manufacturing facility in Chengdu, China to provide us with access to dedicated manufacturing capacity. SCP is expected to manufacture finished products for us on an exclusive basis for sale in the U.S. and other attractive markets and for third parties on a contract basis for sale in other non-U.S. markets. SCP may also directly access the Chinese domestic market. SCP commenced commercial operations in the third quarter of 2013, and has historically incurred significant operating losses. We expect SCP to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future as it continues to ramp up its operations, and have committed to investing in an additional manufacturing line to expand the ability of SCP to manufacture products for the North American market.\nWe may never realize the expected benefits of our SCP manufacturing facility due to, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe facility may never become commercially viable for a variety of reasons in and/or beyond our control;\n\u2022\nthe facility may never receive appropriate FDA or other regulatory approvals to manufacture additional products or such approvals may be delayed;\n\u2022\nthe new manufacturing line may never receive appropriate FDA or other regulatory approvals to manufacture products or such approvals may be delayed;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to incur substantial expenses and make further substantial capital investments to enable the facility to operate efficiently and to contribute positively to our revenue or earnings;\n\u2022\ngeneral political and economic uncertainty could impact operations at the facility, including multiple regulatory requirements that are subject to change, any future implementation of trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements between the U.S. and China, labor regulations or work stoppages at the facility, fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates and complying with U.S. regulations that apply to international operations, including trade laws and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and\n\u2022\noperations at the facility may be disrupted for any reason, including natural disaster, local or international political disputes, or other similar factors.\nAny of these or any other action that results in the manufacturing facility being unable to operate as anticipated could materially adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe may never realize the expected benefits from our acquisition of Omega and it may require substantial additional capital resources.\nOmega is a specialty pharmaceutical company based in Montreal, Canada, which we acquired on October 1, 2014. Omega has served the Canadian and select international markets for over 60 years, with a historic focus on niche generic injectable pharmaceutical products. Prior to our acquisition, Omega had initiated a capacity expansion program, including installing an additional manufacturing line in a recently acquired building adjacent to its existing facility.\nIf we are unable to integrate Omega successfully or achieve the efficiencies and synergies we projected, or if the new manufacturing line does not receive appropriate regulatory approvals to manufacture products, our business could be harmed and our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may never, realize the expected benefits of our Omega acquisition due to, among other things:\n\u2022\nour personnel, systems, procedures or controls may not be adequate to support both our ongoing business and the integration of Omega;\n\u2022\nthe Omega facility may cease to be commercially viable for a variety of reasons in and/or beyond our control;\n\u2022\nthe additional manufacturing capacity may never receive appropriate Health Canada, FDA or other regulatory approvals to manufacture products or such approvals may be delayed;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to incur substantial expenses and make further substantial capital investments to enable the Omega facility to operate efficiently and to continue to contribute positively to our revenue or earnings;\n\u2022\ngeneral political and economic uncertainty could impact operations at the Omega facility, including multiple regulatory requirements that are subject to change, any future implementation of trade\nprotection measures and import or export licensing requirements between the U.S., Canada and China, labor regulations or work stoppages at the facility, fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates and complying with U.S. regulations that apply to international operations, including trade laws and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and\n\u2022\noperations at the facility may be disrupted for any reason, including natural disaster, local or international political disputes, or other similar factors.\nAny of these or any other action that results in Omega being unable to operate as anticipated could materially adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe rely on a single vendor to manage our order to cash cycle and our distribution activities in the U.S., and the loss or disruption of service from this vendor could adversely affect our operations and financial condition\nOur U.S. customer service, order processing, invoicing, cash application, chargeback and rebate processing and distribution and logistics activities are managed by Dohman Life Science Services (\u201cDLSS\u201d). DLSS\u2019s Business Process Outsourcing solution to life science companies connects finance, information systems, commercialization, supply chain, drug safety and sales support processes. If we were to lose the availability of DLSS\u2019s services due to fire, natural disaster or other disruption, such loss could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Although multiple providers of such services exist, there can be no assurance that we could secure another source to handle these transactions on acceptable terms or otherwise to our specifications in the event of a disruption of services at either their Memphis, Tennessee logistics center or Milwaukee, Wisconsin order to cash cycle processing center.\nOur revenue growth may not continue at historical rates, we may never achieve our business strategy of optimizing our gross and operating margins, and our business may suffer as a result of our limited operating history or lack of public company operating experience.\nSince our inception in 2006, we have experienced rapid growth in our net revenue. Although we expect our revenue to continue to grow over the long term due to both continued commercial success with our existing products and the launch of new products, we cannot provide any assurances that our revenue growth will continue at historical rates, if at all. In addition, as part of our business strategy we intend to seek to optimize our gross and operating margins by improving the commercial terms of our supply arrangements and to gain access to additional, more favorable API, product development and manufacturing capabilities, including launching products from our wholly-owned manufacturing facilities. We may, however, encounter unforeseen difficulties in improving the commercial terms of our current supply arrangements, in gaining access to additional arrangements, or in successfully manufacturing products from our wholly-owned facilities, and, as a result, cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in optimizing our margins. Finally, we have a limited operating history at our current scale of operations, and as a public company. Our limited operating history and public company operating experience may make it difficult to forecast and evaluate our future prospects. If we are unable to execute our business strategy and grow our business, either as a result of our inability to manage our current size, effectively manage the business in a public company environment, manage our future growth or for any other reason, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations may have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe generally record sales and pay our expenses in the local currency of the applicable Sagent entity. Substantially all of our business partners that supply us with API, product development services and finished product manufacturing are located in foreign jurisdictions, such as India, China, Romania and Brazil, and we believe they generally incur their respective operating expenses in local currencies, and we generally pay for such API, services and products in U.S. dollars. As a result, both we and our business partners may be exposed to currency rate fluctuations and experience an effective increase in operating expenses in the event local currencies\nappreciate against the U.S. dollar. In this event, the cost of manufacturing product from our SCP or Omega facilities may increase or our business partners may elect to stop providing us with these services or attempt to pass these increased costs back to us through increased prices for product development services, API sourcing or finished products that they supply to us, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal control policies mandate compliance with these laws. Many of our business partners who supply us with product development services, API sourcing and finished product manufacturing are located in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our compliance policies, we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.\nWe may seek to engage in strategic transactions that could have a variety of negative consequences, and we may not realize the benefits of such transactions.\nFrom time to time, we may seek to engage in strategic transactions with third parties, such as strategic partnerships, joint ventures, restructurings, divestitures, acquisitions and other investments. Any such transaction may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near and long-term expenditures, pose significant integration challenges, require additional expertise and disrupt our management and business, which could harm our business, financial position and results of operations. We may face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and transactions, and the negotiation process for any strategic transaction could be time-consuming and complex. There is no assurance that, following the consummation of a strategic transaction, we will achieve the anticipated revenues, profits or other benefits from the transaction, and we may incur greater costs than expected.\nOur inability to protect our intellectual property in the U.S. and foreign countries could limit our ability to manufacture or sell our products.\nAs a specialty and generic pharmaceutical company, we have limited intellectual property surrounding our generic injectable products. However, in the normal course of our business, we develop specialized devices, systems and branding strategies that we will seek to protect through trade secrets, unpatented proprietary know-how, continuing technological innovation, and traditional intellectual property protection through trademarks, copyrights and patents to preserve our competitive position. In addition, we seek copyright protection of our packaging and labels. Despite these measures, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property, copying aspects of our products and packaging, or obtaining and using information that we regard as proprietary, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nUnforeseen problems with the implementation and maintenance of our equipment and information systems could interfere with our operations.\nIn the normal course of business, we must record and process significant amounts of data quickly and accurately and we rely on various computer and telecommunications equipment and information technology systems. Any failure of such equipment or systems could adversely affect our operations.\nAs part of our initiative to update our business processes and information technology systems, we are in the process of implementing new enterprise resource planning software and other related applications. We will incur\nsubstantial costs associated with both implementation and maintenance of these new applications, and unforeseen problems could arise. We have engaged third-party consultants and service providers for the development and implementation of the new systems, and if these parties fail to perform their obligations, development and implementation of the project could be delayed. If the new systems do not perform as originally planned, our business, financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nInvestment funds managed by Vivo Ventures, LLC own a substantial percentage of our common stock, which may prevent other investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nInvestment funds managed by Vivo Ventures, LLC (\u201cVivo Ventures\u201d) beneficially own approximately 7,799,737 shares, or approximately 24.4% of our outstanding Common Stock as of December 31, 2014. As a result, Vivo Ventures will, for the foreseeable future, have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including election of directors, adoption or amendments to equity-based incentive plans, amendments to our certificate of incorporation and certain mergers, acquisitions and other change-of-control transactions. In addition, one investment professional of Vivo Ventures currently serves on our board of directors. Vivo Ventures\u2019 ownership of a large amount of our voting power may have an adverse effect on the price of our Common Stock. The interests of Vivo Ventures may not be consistent with your interests as a stockholder.", "PERMNO": 12695, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "SGNT"}
