{"cik": "879585", "company": "ATN International, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this Report, you should carefully consider the risks described below that could materially affect our business, financial condition, or future results. These risks are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nOperational Risks\nOur inability to recruit and retain experienced management and technical personnel could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to maintain effective internal controls.\nThe success of our business depends on the ability of our executive officers and the officers of our operating units to develop and execute on our business plan, and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations, as well as on our ability to attract and retain these officers and other highly qualified technical and management personnel. If our executive officers and the officers of our operating units are not able to execute on our business plan, this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we believe that there is, and will continue to be, strong competition for qualified personnel in the communications and energy industries and in our markets, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development of our business. We rely heavily on local management to run our operating units. Many of the markets in which we operate are small and remote, and in some cases are subject to government restrictions on granting work visas, which could make it difficult for us to attract and retain talented and qualified managers and staff in those markets. The loss of key personnel or the failure to attract or retain personnel with the sophistication to run complicated communications equipment, networks and systems could have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain effective internal controls, and on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Given the current labor economy, particularly in markets like the United States and Guyana, it may become increasingly difficult to find the right people to fill management roles. We do not currently maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance on any of our key employees and none of the executives at our parent company have executed employment agreements.\nCOVID-19 has and may continue to adversely impact the available labor pool and labor costs in many of our markets.\nWe are watching the global shift from in-person to remote work closely to monitor the impacts that it has on our operations and employees. While many of our employees were able to shift to work-from-home relatively easily during the pandemic, not all of our jobs are eligible for work-from-home. For example, technicians, sales representatives, construction crews are essential to our business operations and require in-person work. When we opened our offices in\nlate 2020 and 2021, we encountered new challenges like employee resistance to vaccine and mask mandates and, in some locations, a reluctance to return to in-office work. While our shift to remote work was successful, we have found that creates added challenges and costs with respect to employee engagement and productivity. As labor demands in certain key markets exceed the supply of eligible workers, however, we may increasingly need to rely on remote workers to fill open positions.\nRemote workers can bring additional challenges with respect to cultural differences abroad. Local practices of conducting business in our foreign operations may not be in line with business practices, recordkeeping and ethics standards in the United States. In order to continue to ensure compliance with foreign and US laws, accounting standards and our own corporate policies, we have implemented financial and operational controls, created an internal audit team responsible for monitoring and ensuring compliance with our internal accounting controls, and routinely train our employees, vendors and consultants. However, having substantial foreign operations also increases the complexity and difficulty of developing, implementing and monitoring these internal controls and procedures. If we are unable to manage these risks effectively, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCyber security breaches, other outages due to failures of network or information technology systems, and outages due to aging or faulty equipment or human error, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe are highly dependent on our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems for the operation of our network, our facilities, delivery of services to our customers and the compilation of our financial results. Failure of these IT systems, through cyberattacks, breaches of security, equipment failures, human error or otherwise, may cause disruptions to our operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully prevent a material security breach stemming from future cyberattacks or avoid major outages caused by other factors. Our inability to operate our network, facilities and back-office systems as a result of such events, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses and impact the timely and accurate delivery of our services or other information. Among the other factors that may also cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity for our customers include power loss, increasing reliance on cloud-storage providers (which may themselves be subject to cyberattack or breach), capacity limitations, software defects and breaches of security by computer viruses, break-ins or otherwise. With respect to cyber security there has been an increase in ransomware attacks in recent years. Telecommunications providers, including vendors to providers, are increasingly being targeted by cyber criminals. These attacks are not always seeking data about their own business, but access to the data of market participants in potentially more lucrative industries. Disruptions in our networks and the unavailability of our services or our inability to efficiently and effectively complete necessary technology or systems upgrades, or conversions could lead to a loss of customers, damage to our reputation and violation of the terms of our licenses and contracts with customers. Additionally, breaches of security may lead to unauthorized access to our customer or employee information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our IT systems. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from operational and security risks, including notification under data privacy laws and regulations, and we may be subject to litigation, regulatory penalties and financial losses. These failures could also lead to significant negative publicity.\nIn addition, much of our underlying physical infrastructure (particularly in Guyana and Alaska), including buildings, fleet vehicles and related systems and equipment, has been in service for an extended period of time. We may not be able to adequately fund the maintenance and replacement of this infrastructure on a basis timely enough to avoid material outages, or be able to locate replacement parts or spares to repair existing equipment due to its age. Any outage caused by faults in our aging equipment or unaddressed maintenance costs could negatively impact our operations, including the provision of service to its customers and could result in adverse effects to our financial condition.\nWe are reliant on government funding to comply with the FCC\u2019s \u201cReplace and Remove\u201d program.\nA number of our equipment suppliers and vendors are based outside the United States, with China serving as a significant non-US source for our telecommunications network equipment in the United States. The FCC\u2019s governmental restrictions on the procurement of equipment from certain Chinese vendors will result in a costly network replacement build in our western United States operations that, if not offset by government support, could adversely affect our results\nof operations. While we have submitted an application to participate in the FCC\u2019s replacement and reimbursement program for our Chinese vendor equipment, and Congress has appropriated funds for the purpose, if we are not successful in receiving the amount of funds that is necessary to remove equipment from restricted vendors or are unable to complete the removal and replacement in the time frame specified in any final rules, or have underestimated the cost of replacement, it could adversely our ability to operate, maintain or expand our domestic network infrastructure.\nWe rely on a limited number of key suppliers and vendors for the timely supply of handsets, accessories, equipment and services relating to our network or facility infrastructure. Changes in import tax policy or trade relations, interruptions in our supply chain or increased commodity or supply chain costs could adversely affect our results of operations.\nLike other companies globally, we faced major supply chain disruptions across our business in 2021, which led to increased costs, delays and in some cases lost opportunities. We depend on a limited number of suppliers and vendors for equipment and services relating to our mobile handset lineup, network infrastructure, and our back-office IT systems infrastructure. If these suppliers experience interruptions or other problems delivering these network components and other equipment on a timely basis, our subscriber or revenue growth and operating results could suffer significantly. In addition, the size of our business relative to many of our competitors puts us at a disadvantage in terms of whether we will get access to the newest technologies at the same time as our competitors, as well as a financial disadvantage in terms of the ability to achieve economies of scale and receive commensurate discounts that may be available to our competitors.\nWe source wireless devices for our retail wireless businesses from a small number of handset resellers and to a lesser extent, equipment manufacturers, and we depend on access to compelling devices at reasonable prices on primary and secondary markets for these devices, as well as timely delivery of devices to meet market demands. The inability to provide a competitive device lineup could materially impact our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers. Moreover, as we increasingly roll out new products such as voLTE, we will increasingly rely on cooperation from our handset suppliers to ensure interoperability between devices and our network. Without close relationships with suppliers who understand the needs of our business, we may be delayed in deploying the handsets, accessories and equipment that our customers demand. We are also reliant upon a limited number of network equipment manufacturers, including Ericsson and Nokia.\nAs a result of the 2021 supply chain disruptions, our procurement and operational business functions have increased planning and strategic purchasing, but we do not expect the global supply chain issues to be remedied in the near future. Because a large portion of our equipment is sourced, directly or indirectly, from outside the United States, major changes in tax policy or trade relations, such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported products or the imposition of additional tariffs or duties on imported products, could also adversely affect our business, results of operations, effective income tax rate, liquidity and net income.\nInclement weather, changes in meteorological conditions and other natural disasters may materially disrupt our operations.\nMany of the areas in which we operate have experienced severe weather conditions over the years including hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, fires, damaging storms, floods and earthquakes. Such events may materially disrupt and adversely affect our business operations, such as the impacts of the hurricanes in the US Virgin Islands in 2017, which we assessed caused damage and losses to our fixed and mobile networks of approximately $100 million in operating losses and network rebuilding costs prior to insurance and any other recovery assistance. Major hurricanes have also passed directly over Bermuda and Cayman several times in the past decade, causing damage to our network and to the island\u2019s infrastructure. Guyana and Cayman have each suffered from severe rains and flooding in the past as well. With the addition of business operations in Alaska, our company operations now face increased earthquake, volcanic, fire and winter storm risk. These types of events can also cause major disruption and harm to the communities and markets we serve, compounded by the fact that many of our service areas have limited emergency responses assets and may be difficult to reach in an emergency situation, which can have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot be sure that these types of events will not have an impact in the future or that we can procure insurance coverage against these types of severe weather and geological events under reasonable business terms and conditions, or that any insurance\ncoverage we are able to maintain will adequately compensate us for all damage and economic losses resulting from natural catastrophes. In addition, it may take significant time to return to pre-disaster levels following any such meteorological or geological event. If we are unable to restore service on a timely and cost-effective basis, it could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations through continued loss of revenue and customer attrition to our competitors.\nIn addition, the impacts of climate change may exacerbate the risk of significant damage in the areas in which we operate. For example, rising ocean temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean may result in the intensification of hurricanes over time. Heat waves and severe drought may lead to stronger and more frequent wildfires that could threaten our towers and installed equipment or result in loss of power. Rising sea levels and associated flooding may impact our retail and enterprise customers that operate businesses on the coasts of the United States and in our island markets. If the frequency or duration of more intense weather events increase, the likelihood of significant damage also increases. After major events such as hurricanes, earthquakes or wildfires, which can cause significant destruction to the power grid, our ability to access sites and facilities, obtain fuel and receive sufficient fuel supplies in order to provide power for stand-by generators is often severely limited, and in many cases, is not possible for extended periods of time. Our ability to access ports in order to obtain relief and supplies for affected areas may also be significantly hampered for extended periods of time following any such disaster, as was the case with the 2017 hurricanes in the US Virgin Islands.\nWe may not be able to timely and effectively meet our obligations to AT&T related to its partnership with the First Responder Network Authority.\nOn July 31, 2019, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Commnet Wireless, entered into a Network Build and Maintenance Agreement with AT&T Mobility LLC (\u201cAT&T\u201d), pursuant to which Commnet will engineer, construct, commission, and maintain a radio access network (\u201cRAN\u201d) for AT&T for its commercial use and also in support of AT&T\u2019s public/private partnership with the First Responder Network Authority (\u201cFirstNet Authority\u201d). In connection with the Network Build & Maintenance Agreement, we are required to build a network in portions of several states in accordance with AT&T\u2019s detailed specifications by specified milestone dates and thereafter, to maintain the network in accordance with certain quality metrics. Such services are structured as a set cost agreed upon with AT&T, to be paid over the initial eight-year term of the Network Build and Maintenance Agreement. AT&T has the right to terminate this agreement, including its obligation to pay for ongoing maintenance of the sites, in the event that Commnet fails to meet certain milestones or completion dates with respect to the construction of the sites, or fails to meet certain quality metrics and service level agreements (\u201cSLAs\u201d) with respect to maintenance services for the built sites.\nOur ability to meet required milestones and completion dates and perform the SLAs is dependent on a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf our ability to procure equipment and negotiate favorable payment and other terms with suppliers;\n\u25cf our ability to effectively manage the construction of each of the cell sites, including securing reliable and efficient field construction resources; and\n\u25cf our ability to cost effectively and reliably deliver and manage the network in accordance with SLAs for both the AT&T commercial and FirstNet Authority networks.\nIn addition, construction of the cell sites may be also adversely affected by circumstances outside of our control, including inclement weather, adverse geological and environmental conditions, a failure to receive regulatory approvals or necessary permits on schedule or third-party delays in providing supplies and other materials. The processing of necessary regulatory approvals and permits has been particularly disrupted by COVID-19 where government offices have shut down due to lockdowns or substantially delayed review and approval times. Further, our ability to undertake construction activities and the availability of our workforce may be impacted by shutdowns due to COVID-19, or our personnel actually contracting the virus. Any construction setbacks or delays could be costly and have a material adverse effect on our ability to perform under the time conditions and strict budget required under the Network Build and Maintenance Agreement.\nIf AT&T were to terminate the Network Build & Maintenance Agreement, this could have a material adverse impact on our prospects and results of operations in our US Telecom segment as we would have incurred costs to\nconstruct the sites, but might not be fully compensated for the construction of the sites through the initial term of the Agreement. As we successfully complete construction of individual sites in addition to the approximately 200 sites built as of December 31, 2021, the likelihood and impact of this risk decreases.\nThe continued impact of COVID-19 may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a novel strain of coronavirus, now referred to as COVID-19, as a pandemic, as the virus spread globally to multiple countries, including the United States and other countries in which we have substantial operations. The pandemic has resulted in and will likely continue to result in significant disruptions to global business activities around the world.\nWe are continuing to monitor and assess the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our commercial operations, including any potential impact on our revenue and supply chain costs in 2022. However, the ultimate extent to which this pandemic impacts our business will depend upon the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and actions to contain the outbreak or mitigate its impact, as well as the timing and rollout of approved vaccines to combat the spread of COVID-19 and the impact on the economies in which we operate. For example, the local economies of many of our Caribbean markets are tourism-dependent and while travel in 2021 was up from 2020, there is still an overall decrease that may continue to impact our revenue and cash flows for certain services in these markets as our retail and enterprise customers are impacted. Further, we may continue to experience a decline in roaming revenue due to lack of travel to and from these markets.\nAdditionally, governmental actions in our jurisdictions intended to contain the COVID-19 outbreak have placed restrictions on travel and movement, resulting in significant business interruptions to both our business and that of our customers, delays in receipt of governmental approvals and permits, the acceleration of \u201cpopulation flight\u201d from island markets, and supply chain delays in the procurement process causing delays in our scheduled build plans, including with respect to planned fiber optic installations and maintenance in our Caribbean markets and our ongoing construction pursuant to the FirstNet Transaction with AT&T. Any prolonged interruption could negatively impact our customers\u2019 ability to pay for our services on a timely basis or at all and our ability to expand, as well as the ability of our field technicians to service our (or with respect to FirstNet, our customer\u2019s) telecommunications network. For more information about the risks to our business with respect to failure to perform under the FirstNet Transaction, see \u201cOperational Risks -- We may not be able to timely and effectively meet our obligations to AT&T related to its partnership with the First Responder Network Authority.\u201d\nFurther, in September 2021, the President issued an Executive Order requiring certain COVID-19 precautions for government contractors and their subcontractors, including mandatory employee vaccination (subject to medical and religious exemptions). Our Alaska Communications subsidiary is a federal government contractor. In November 2021, the Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, issued an Emergency Temporary Standard, or ETS, requiring that all employers with at least 100 employees ensure that their employees are fully vaccinated for COVID-19 or obtain a negative COVID-19 test at least once a week. The Executive Order was preliminarily enjoined by several U.S. federal district courts, the U.S. Supreme Court preliminarily stayed the OSHA ETS in January 2022, and OSHA subsequently withdrew the ETS. While we and our subsidiaries are not currently subject to any vaccine mandate, any requirement to mandate COVID-19 vaccination of our workforces or require our unvaccinated employees to be tested weekly could result in employee attrition and difficulty securing future labor needs and may have an adverse effect on future profit margins. In addition, any requirement to impose such obligations on our suppliers who are deemed government contractors and their subcontractors could adversely impact the price and continuity of supply of raw materials, and our results of operations and financial condition could ultimately be adversely affected. It continues to be our policy to encourage each of our employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.\nWe may have difficulty meeting the growing demand for data services.\nDemand for smartphones and data services continues to grow across all of our wireless markets and we have seen an acute increase for such demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020 and 2021, we faced supply shortages and supply constraints on multiple models of low-cost mobile devices. Our value to our customers in some markets\ndepends in part on our network\u2019s ability to provide high-quality and high-capacity network service to smartphone devices. Indeed, much of the revenue growth in our wireless businesses in the past few years has been attributable to increased demand for data services. If, however, data usage increases faster than we anticipate and exceeds the then-available capacity of any of our networks, our costs to deliver services may be higher than we anticipate. In the United States, the dearth of available spectrum and/or non-transparent spectrum allocation practices in our other markets means that we cannot guarantee that we will be able to acquire additional spectrum in a timely fashion, at a reasonable cost, or at all to ensure our ability to maintain or grow our business and traffic volumes. As demand for advanced mobile data services continues to grow, we may have difficulty satisfying our retail and wholesale customers\u2019 demand for these services without substantial upgrades and additional capital expenditures and operating expenses, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may have difficulty securing video services content from third parties desirable to our customers on terms and conditions favorable to us.\nWe have secured licensing agreements with numerous content providers to allow our various video services businesses to offer a wide array of popular programming to our subscribers. Typically, we make long-term commitments relating to these rights in advance even though we cannot predict the popularity of the services or ratings the programming will generate. License fees may be negotiated for a number of years and may include provisions requiring us to pay part of the fees even if we choose not to distribute such programming.\nThe success of our video services operations depends on our ability to access an attractive selection of video programming from content providers on terms and pricing favorable to us. Our ability to provide movies, sports and other popular programming is a major factor that attracts subscribers to our services. Our inability to provide the content desired by our subscribers on satisfactory terms or at all could result in reduced demand for, and lower revenue from, our cable operations that may not offset the typically large subscription fees that we pay for these services. In certain cases, we may not have satisfactory contracts in place with the owners of our distributed content, leading to such parties\u2019 desire for increased renewed contractual pricing or leading to disputes with such parties including claims for copyright or other intellectual property infringement.\nThe cost of obtaining programming associated with providing our video services is significant. Many of our programming contracts are for multiple year terms and provide for future increases in the fees we must pay. In addition, local over-the-air television stations are increasingly seeking substantial fees for retransmission of their stations over our cable networks. Historically, we have absorbed increased programming costs in large part through increased prices to our customers. We cannot assure that competitive and other marketplace factors will permit us to continue to pass through these costs or that we will be able to renew programming agreements on comparable or favorable terms. Also, programming in the Caribbean typically includes Latin American or Spanish programming, while our subscribers typically prefer content in English. An additional risk with respect to video services is increased competition from so-called \u201cover the top\u201d (\u201cOTT\u201d) media service providers. Additionally, more and more content providers have launched their own OTT offerings, for example Netflix, Amazon, HBO, Disney+, and others. As these and other OTT offerings gain market share, it may result in a loss of subscribers across our businesses that offer video services because customers are more attracted to these alternative offerings, or to the extent we are no longer able to offer programming that customers want either due to exclusive licensing arrangements or prohibitive rising costs. To the extent that we are unable to reach acceptable agreements with programmers or obtain desired content, we may be forced to remove programming from our line-up, which could result in a loss of customers and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nStrategic Risks\nIncreased competition may adversely affect growth, require increased capital expenditures, result in the loss of existing customers and decrease our revenues.\nOver the last decade, an increase in competition in many areas of the telecommunications industry has contributed to a decline in prices for communication services, including mobile wireless services, local and long-distance telephone service and data services. Increased competition in the industry may further decrease prices. In addition,\nincreased competition in the communications industry could reduce our customer base, require us to invest in new facilities and capabilities and result in reduced revenues, margins and returns.\nOur International Telecom segment operates in island and other small market locations where a limited number of providers maintain strong competition. In several of our markets, we hold a leading position as the local incumbent carrier and in others we may have a competitive advantage in our ability to bundle some combination of voice, data, video and wireless services. Increased competition, whether from new entrants or increased capital investment by our competitors in their existing networks, will make it more difficult for us to attract and retain customers in our small markets, which could result in lower revenue and cash flow from operating activities.\nCompetition in the markets in which we operate increased in 2021 due to a number of governmental and economic factors. For example:\n\u25cf In Guyana, the government\u2019s issuance of licenses for national and international voice and data traffic has allowed for legal competition in the market. While illegal bypass of our network had been ongoing and the exclusivity of our license went unenforced by the government for more than a decade, there are signs that Guyana\u2019s rapidly growing economy is leading to more investment and, potentially new entrants, into the country\u2019s telecommunications market.\n\u25cf Across the United States, increased government spending, particularly in broadband infrastructure, as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to alter the competitive landscape, as new market entrants seek to capture government funds. In addition, we will face increased competition securing construction crews and equipment with the increased number of construction projects across the United States spurred on by these government awards.\n\u25cf In the US Virgin Islands, in 2020, we lost government funding of our wireline network and in 2020 and 2021, Liberty Latin America acquired both of our two largest competitors on the island. This may increase competition in the both the fixed and mobile markets, and negatively impact our market share, revenues, operating margins or free cash flow.\n\u25cf In Bermuda, the regulator has declared our telecommunications company \u201cdominant\u201d in certain sectors, which may negatively impact our ability to compete in the market, though we are disputing the process and authority.\n\u25cf In Bermuda and the Caribbean, we compete primarily against Digicel, a large mobile telecommunications company in the Caribbean region, and other larger providers such as Liberty Latin America, a multinational telecommunications company.\n\u25cf Alaska is a new market for us, with strong competitors that make it difficult for us to attract and retain customers, which could result in lower revenue and cash flow from operating activities. Our principal competitor is GCI, who holds a dominant position through its extensive coaxial cable, fiber optic, microwave and satellite based middle mile network as well as its undersea fiber cable network, where it owns and operates two of the four existing undersea fiber optic cables connecting Alaska to the contiguous states. With a long history of operating in Alaska, AT&T also has a terrestrial long-haul network in Alaska where the focus is on serving certain national customers. AT&T\u2019s primary mass-market focus in Alaska is providing mobile wireless services.\n\u25cf As we compete more extensively in the Alaska market, we are likely to face increased and new competition, both local and national. There can be no assurance that we will compete successfully against larger or more established competitors in Alaska or our existing markets, and the failure to compete effectively may adversely impact our ability to meet our growth and revenue plans which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nRapid and significant technological changes in the telecommunications industry may adversely affect us.\nOur industry faces rapid and significant changes in technology that directly impact our business, including the following:\n\u25cf migration to new-generation services such as \u201c5G\u201d network technology;\n\u25cf introduction of new telecom delivery platforms such as next generation satellite services;\n\u25cf evolving industry standards;\n\u25cf requirements resulting from changing regulatory regimes;\n\u25cf the allocation of radio frequency spectrum in which to license and operate wireless services;\n\u25cf ongoing improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology;\n\u25cf changes in end-user requirements and preferences;\n\u25cf convergence between video and data services;\n\u25cf development of data and broadband capabilities and rapidly expanding demand for those capabilities;\n\u25cf increased reliance on third-party cloud storage providers for data storage; and\n\u25cf consolidation among service providers within the industry.\nFor us to keep pace with these technological changes and remain competitive, at a minimum we must continue to make significant capital expenditures to add to our networks\u2019 capacity, coverage and technical capability. For example, we have spent considerable amounts adding higher speed and capacity mobile data services for many of our networks in recent years and we think it likely that more such expenditures, including mobile and wireless data capabilities and high capacity, low latency backhaul, will be needed over the next few years.\nWe cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business. Alternative or new technologies may be developed that provide communications services superior to those available from us, which may adversely affect our business. For example, to accommodate the demand from our wireless customers for next-generation advanced wireless products such as high-speed data and streaming video, we may be required to purchase additional spectrum. Though we did acquire some spectrum assets in 2021 with our award of some CBRS spectrum licenses in the US, at times we have had difficulty finding spectrum for sale or on terms that are acceptable to us. In addition, usage of wireless voice or broadband services in excess of our expectations could strain our capacity, cause service disruptions and result in higher operating costs and capital expenditures. In each of our markets, providing more and higher speed data services through our wireless or wireline networks may require us to make substantial investments in additional telecommunications transport capacity connecting our networks to the Internet, and in some cases such capacity may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all. Failure to provide these services or to upgrade to new technologies on a timely basis and at an acceptable cost, or to secure any necessary regulatory approvals to roll out such new technologies on a timely basis all could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete with carriers in our markets.\nWe may not be able to timely and effectively execute on several key initiatives across multiple jurisdictions.\nMajor business initiatives are underway with respect to improvement in mobile and other retail sales in all markets, digitization of internal processes to allow for quicker response time to customer requirements, modernization of existing internal processes in select markets and revising the strategy of some of our US Telecom businesses to develop additional revenue streams, including the substantial construction and support undertaking of the FirstNet project and the Alaska Transaction. Each of these requires significant oversight from senior management to aid in-market teams, and\nmany of these projects are underway simultaneously in different locations. Execution on multiple simultaneous and transformational initiatives will require in depth management attention in multiple jurisdictions in order to capitalize on growth in the US Virgin Islands, economic growth in Guyana, the ongoing shift in business focus in US Telecom and the integration of Alaska Communications.\nWe may not be able to effectively transform the business model of our legacy US Telecom business.\nHistorically, a large portion of our revenue has been derived from carrier services in our US Telecom segment. A substantial portion of this revenue was generated from three national wireless service providers in 2020, however, these amounts have declined to $61.9 million in 2021 from $72.6 million in 2020. During this time period, revenues from carrier services have declined due to our mutual agreement with our carrier customers to lower rates in exchange for pricing certainty in longer term contracts, our customers\u2019 decisions to overbuild our network, and the consolidation of national wireless service providers (thereby eliminating one or more former carrier customers).\nWe are increasingly providing network infrastructure services as part of our expanded carrier services offering, such as tower leasing, transport and field services, to our carrier partners to supplement our historic wholesale roaming revenue base (for example, the FirstNet Transaction). As wholesale roaming on the majority of our US network continues to decline, we will offset that revenue by providing maintenance and expanded carrier services (including more leasing and transport services) to other carriers to offset lost revenue, albeit at lower operating income margins due to the increased operating expenses associated with leasing and transport services, as compared to our wholesale mobile roaming services.\nWe also intend to offset declining wholesale roaming revenue with a more diversified mix of revenue by growing our fiber network to offer more broadband and other data services to businesses, governments and consumers in and adjacent to our historical operating area in the contiguous United States. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to successfully transform our legacy US Telecom business to support additional carrier services product offerings or expand our retail and commercial subscriber base in our US Telecom segment. If we are unable to offset the continued decline in our Carrier Services revenue by expanding and diversifying our sources of revenue it may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may have difficulty funding multiple opportunities across our businesses.\nHistorically, we have funded our capital expenditures and transactional matters from a combination of cash on hand, cash from operations, and limited incurrence of debt. As discussed above, our US Telecom segment is in the midst of a business transformation, and may need significant funding as we seek to grow our fiber network and capacity. With the Alaska Transaction in 2021, we increased the amount of the existing credit facility and have substantially decreased our cash reserves. Similarly, we may have other opportunities to inorganically grow our businesses and our team actively evaluates potential acquisitions, investment opportunities and other strategic transactions, both domestic and international, that have the potential for generating steady excess cash flows over extended periods of time. Any such transactions may be accomplished through the payment of cash, issuance of shares of our capital stock or incurrence of additional debt, or a combination thereof. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $81.0 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short term investments and approximately $331.8 million of long-term debt. How and when we deploy our balance sheet capacity will figure prominently in our longer-term growth prospects and stockholder returns. To support multiple simultaneous growth opportunities, we may need to raise additional capital or incur additional debt to fund our future operations or investment opportunities. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to secure additional funding from public or private offerings on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain the requisite amount of financing, we may have to forgo opportunities to strategically grow our business.\nWe are actively evaluating investment, acquisition and other strategic opportunities, which may affect our long-term growth prospects.\nTo date we have grown through a mix of organic growth through our operating companies and inorganic growth through targeting acquisition or other business development opportunities. We actively evaluate acquisition, investment, business divestitures and combinations, and other strategic opportunities, both domestic and international, in\ntelecommunications, energy-related and other industries, including in areas that may not be seen by the broader market as timely today, such as our acquisition of Alaska Communications. We may focus on opportunities that we believe have potential for long-term organic and strategic growth or that may otherwise satisfy our return and other investment criteria. Similarly, there are risks inherent in the sale of a business or assets, including the potential of a transaction\u2019s failing to close due to last minute negotiations, regulatory issues, or other unpredictable matters that can be costly and disruptive to our operations. There can be no assurance as to whether, when or on what terms we will be able to invest in, acquire or divest any businesses or assets to continue our historic pattern of inorganic growth or that we will be able to successfully integrate the business or realize the perceived benefits of any acquisition or strategic investment.\nRegulatory Risks\nThe Rural Health Care program in Alaska is being audited by USAC, and we may be subject to forfeiture or fine.\nAlaska Communications participates in the Universal Service Administration\u2019s (\u201cUSAC\u201d) Rural Health Care program and received inquiries and requests for information from USAC, which administers the program, in connection with both current funding requests and, beginning with a letter dated June 2, 2017 from USAC\u2019s auditors, prior period support payments. After Alaska Communications responded to the initial request for information about support payments prior to 2017, USAC\u2019s auditors asked Alaska Communications to comment on some preliminary audit findings, and it responded with a letter dated December 21, 2018. On February 24, 2020, Alaska Communications received a draft audit report from USAC that alleges violations of the FCC\u2019s rules for establishing rural rates and urban rates, the provisioning and billing of ineligible services and products, and violations of the FCC\u2019s competitive bidding rules. Alaska Communications has engaged in dialogue with USAC\u2019s auditors and looks forward to resolving all of USAC\u2019s concerns.\nAlaska Communications also received a Letter of Inquiry on March 18, 2018, from the FCC Enforcement Bureau requesting historical information regarding its participation in the FCC\u2019s Rural Health Care program. In response, Alaska Communications produced voluminous records throughout 2018 and into the first quarter of 2019. On November 5, 2019 and January 22, 2021 Alaska Communications received additional letters from the FCC Enforcement Bureau requesting additional information, to which it responded. To date, the FCC\u2019s Enforcement Bureau has not asserted any claims or alleged any rule violations. Alaska Communications continues to work constructively with the FCC\u2019s Enforcement Bureau to provide it the information it is seeking.\nSimilar audits of other companies have resulted in the FCC recouping certain previously awarded support funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of the USAC audit or the FCC Enforcement Bureau\u2019s inquiry or the impact it may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nAny change in federal or state funding could materially and adversely impact Alaska Communications\u2019 financial position and results of operations.\nAlaska Communications historically received federal high cost universal service payment revenues to support its wireline operations in high cost areas. In 2011, the FCC released a Transformation Order that established a new framework for high cost universal service support for price capped carriers that replaced existing support mechanisms that provide support to carriers that serve high-cost areas with new Connect America Fund (\u201cCAF\u201d) support mechanisms and service obligations that are focused on broadband Internet access services.\nThe FCC released its CAF II order, specific to Alaska Communications as the only price capped carrier in Alaska, on October 31, 2016, pursuant to which Alaska Communications receives approximately $19.7 million annually in order to meet certain buildout requirements in Alaska over a 10-year period. Funding under the new program generally requires Alaska Communications to provide broadband service to unserved locations throughout the designated coverage area by the end of a specified build-out period, and meet interim milestone build-out obligations. As a result, while Alaska Communications currently expects its High Cost Program support revenue to be relatively unchanged for the next four years, it also expects that the FCC will enact substantial changes regarding our High Cost Program support funding after 2025.\nThere can be no assurance that Alaska Communications will meet its CAF II obligations utilizing the delivery of broadband Internet access using a fixed wireless platform in a capital-efficient manner or at all, and there is uncertainty regarding the future level of revenue as well as the future obligations tied to this funding. If Alaska Communications fails to meet its obligations under the CAF II order, or requires substantial additional capital expenditures in order to meet the obligations under the timeline required, its revenue, results of operations and liquidity may be materially adversely impacted.\nChanges in USF funding could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations in the Virgin Islands.\nViya, our subsidiary operating video, internet, wireless and landline services in the US Virgin Islands, has historically received, through December 31, 2020, high-cost USF support in the US Virgin Islands of approximately $16.4 million per year. In addition, after the devastation caused by the Hurricanes in September 2017, the FCC provided approximately $15.4 million in accelerated USF support and in fixed and mobile recovery support through August 2018. The FCC, in response to the damage caused by the Hurricanes and as part of its general USF reform, established a Connect USVI Fund that replaced the legacy high-cost USF support for the US Virgin Islands that Viya historically has been awarded. In November 2020, the FCC announced the award of the Connect USVI Fund for all of the US Virgin Islands to Viya\u2019s competitor in the amount of approximately $8.6 million per year for a term of 10 years. Pursuant to the terms of the program, Viya\u2019s USF spending was reduced in July 2021 to approximately two-thirds of the legacy total amount, or $10.9 million, and will be reduced again in July 2022 to approximately one-third of the legacy total amount, or $5.47 million, through July 2023. Thereafter, Viya will not be eligible for high-cost USF support.\nThis reduction in the overall amount of USF support we receive as a result of the Connect USVI Fund proceeding relative to historical levels of high-cost USF support we have received negatively affects our efforts to build, maintain and operate networks in the US Virgin Islands and our ability to provide services previously supported by USF funds. Viya is currently undertaking a review and reassessment of its business plan to consider the extent to which we will provide further investment or operational resources to Viya or the territory. This could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in our International Telecom segment and there can be no assurance that any revised business plan will offset or reduce the loss of revenue, customer attrition and increased competition as a result of the cessation of high-cost USF funding.\nOur operations in Guyana are subject to significant political and regulatory risk.\nSince 1991, pursuant to an agreement with the Government of Guyana, GTT has operated in Guyana pursuant to a license from the Government of Guyana to be the exclusive provider of domestic and international voice and data services. That license from the Government of Guyana included an initial term ending in December 2010, which was renewable at our sole option for an additional 20-year term. In November 2009, we notified the Government of Guyana of our election to renew our exclusive license for an additional 20-year term expiring in 2030. On December 15, 2010, we received correspondence from the Government of Guyana indicating that our license had been renewed until such time that new legislation was enacted to expand competition within the sector.\nOn October 5, 2020, the Prime Minister of Guyana formally implemented telecommunications legislation previously passed by the Guyana Parliament in 2016 that introduces material changes to many features of Guyana\u2019s existing telecommunications regulatory regime with the intention of creating a more competitive market. At that time, we were issued a new license to provide domestic and international voice as well as data services and mobile services in Guyana. Two of our competitors, who had previously provided fixed voice and internet services on an unlicensed basis, were issued service licenses as well. While we have requested details of our competitors\u2019 licenses, such information has not been made public by the Guyana Telecommunications Agency, however our competitors are openly providing services that are competitive with GTT\u2019s exclusive rights contained in its 1990 license.\nOn October 23, 2020, the Government of Guyana also brought into effect new telecommunications regulations called for by the telecommunications legislation. The regulations include new requirements for the market as a whole, which impact our operations, administrative reporting and services. There can be no assurance that these regulations will\nbe effectively implemented, or that they will be administered in a fair and transparent manner. We believe our existing, exclusive license continues to be valid unless and until such time as we enter into an alternative arrangement with the Government. Under these circumstances, however, there can be no assurance that our discussions with the Government of Guyana will resume or be concluded, or that such discussions will satisfactorily address our contractual exclusivity rights. While we might seek damages or other compensation for any involuntary termination of our contractual exclusivity rights, we cannot guarantee that we would prevail in any proceedings to enforce our rights. While the government unilaterally moved to liberalization at the end of 2020, Guyana remains a high-risk environment due to political and judicial uncertainty. There can be no assurances that the government can achieve reform or achieve reform in ways that are fairly applied.\nRegulatory changes may impose restrictions that adversely affect us or cause us to incur significant unplanned costs in modifying our business plans or operations.\nWe are subject to US federal, state and local regulations and foreign government regulations, all of which are subject to change. As new laws and regulations are issued or discontinued, we may be required to materially modify our business plans or operations. We cannot be certain that we can do so in a cost effective manner. Our operations in the United States are subject to the Communications Act and the FCC\u2019s implementing regulations, as well as regulation by state public utility commissions in certain states in which we operate. The interpretation and implementation of the various provisions of the Communications Act and the FCC rules implementing the Communications Act continue to be heavily debated and may have a material adverse effect on our business. Also, there have been indications that Congress may substantially revise the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and other regulations in the next few years. Further, the leadership of the FCC changed in January 2021, and the FCC may pursue new and differed regulatory priorities.\nOur international operations are subject to similar regulations, the interpretation and implementation of which are also often debated, and which may have a material adverse effect on our business. Our interpretations of our obligations may differ from those of regulatory authorities. Both federal and state regulators, as well as international regulators, require us to pay various fees and assessments, file periodic reports and comply with various rules regarding our consumer marketing practices and the contents of our bills, on an on-going basis. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we may be subject to fines or potentially be asked to show cause as to why our licenses to provide service should not be revoked.\nThe loss of certain licenses could adversely affect our ability to provide wireless and broadband services.\nIn the United States, wireless licenses generally are valid for 10 years from the effective date of the license, although recently issued 600 MHz licenses were granted for a slightly longer initial term to account for the need for broadcast television incumbents to vacate the spectrum before the new wireless licensees could construct. Licensees may renew their licenses (including renewal of 600 MHz licenses) for additional 10-year periods by filing renewal applications with the FCC. Our 600 MHz wireless licenses all expire in 2029. Our other wireless licenses in the US expire between 2021 and sometime after 2030. We intend to renew our licenses expiring this year, and the renewal applications are subject to FCC review and are put out for public comment to ensure that the licensees meet their licensing requirements and comply with other applicable FCC mandates. Failure to file for renewal of these licenses or failure to meet any licensing requirements could lead to a denial of the renewal application and thus adversely affect our ability to continue to provide service in that license area. Furthermore, our compliance with regulatory requirements, such as E-911 and CALEA requirements, may depend on the availability of necessary equipment or software.\nIn our international markets, telecommunications licenses are typically issued and regulated by the applicable telecommunications ministry. The application and renewal process for these licenses may be lengthy, require us to expend substantial renewal fees, and/or be subject to regulatory or legislative uncertainty, such as we are experiencing in Guyana, as described above. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements may have an adverse effect on our licenses or operations and could result in sanctions, fines or other penalties.\nEconomic Risks\nGeneral economic factors, domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services, require a change in the services we sell or have a significant impact on our operating costs. Energy costs are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, or weather conditions. Rapid and significant changes in these and other commodity prices may affect our sales and profit margins. General economic conditions can also be affected by the outbreak of war, acts of terrorism, or other significant national or international events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition, an economic downturn in the markets in which we currently operate or in the global market generally may lead to slower economic activity, increased unemployment, concerns about inflation, decreased consumer confidence and other adverse business conditions that could have an impact on our businesses. For example, among other things:\n\u25cf a decrease in tourism could negatively affect revenues and growth opportunities from operations in the islands and in a number of areas covered by US rural and wholesale wireless operations that serve tourist destinations; and\n\u25cf an increase in \u201cbad debt,\u201d or the amounts that we have to write-off of our accounts receivable could result from our inability to collect subscription fees from our subscribers.\nIn 2021 we saw a return to tourism in some of our tourism-dependent markets over 2020, but on an aggregate basis tourist activity in the markets we operate remains below pre-pandemic levels. The continuation of government-imposed shutdowns and travel restrictions limited the amount of customers roaming onto our network, in addition to depressing demand for our services generally in the hospitality industry (e.g. hotels, bars, and restaurants) that is traditionally supported by the tourism industry. Further, we also started to see population flight from some of our island markets for a variety of reasons including continued lockdowns and travel restrictions and also general economic downturns. It is unknown what the long-term economic effects of these negative impacts on the tourism industry will be, but our business operations and revenue may certainly be adversely impacted as a result.\nThe long-term impact, if any, that these events might have on us and our business, is uncertain.\nThe successful operation and growth of our business in two of our major markets (Guyana and Alaska) is highly dependent on economic conditions which may deteriorate due to reductions in crude oil prices or demand.\nSuccessful operation and growth in Guyana and Alaska largely depend on local economic conditions due to their remote geographies. The Alaska and Guyanese economies, in turn, depend heavily on the strength of the natural resource industries, particularly oil production and prices of crude oil. The supply and price of crude oil can be volatile and influenced by a myriad of factors beyond our control, including foreign actors (like OPEC), worldwide supply and demand, natural disasters and other events, the move by many governments, businesses, and institutions towards \u201cde-carbonization\u201d and political conditions.\nAlaska\u2019s economy is dependent on investment by oil companies, and state tax revenues correlate with the price of oil as the State assesses a tax based on the value of the oil that transits the pipeline from the North Slope. Guyana is projected to have tremendous economic growth in upcoming years that is largely dependent on the continued supply of crude oils and the government\u2019s efficient use of its portion of the revenues from crude oil sales. The impact of this change on the State\u2019s economy is uncertain.\nOverall economic impacts from a sustained lower price of crude oil, on Alaska on the one hand, and from projected revenue from sales of oil, for Guyana on the other hand, if maintained over time, will impact our growth in the future.\nOur operations are subject to economic, political, currency and other risks that could adversely affect our revenues or financial position.\nOur operations may face adverse financial consequences and operational problems due to political or economic changes, such as changes in national or regional political or economic conditions, laws and regulations that restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds, or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As new laws and regulations are issued or discontinued to implement an agenda set by the current US administration, we may be required to materially modify our business plans or operations. For example, the Bermuda and Cayman governments are considering the implementation of a global minimum tax, which could accelerate businesses leaving Bermuda or the Cayman Islands and contribute to shrinking/stagnant populations of Bermuda or the Cayman Islands, which could decrease our customer base and adversely affect our revenues or financial position.\nOur debt instruments include restrictive and financial covenants that limit our operating flexibility.\nThe credit facilities that we and our subsidiaries maintain include certain financial and other covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to take specific actions, even if we believe such actions are in our best interest. These include restrictions on our ability to do the following:\n\u25cf incur additional debt;\n\u25cf create liens or negative pledges with respect to our assets;\n\u25cf pay dividends or distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, our capital stock;\n\u25cf make investments, loans or advances or other forms of payments;\n\u25cf issue, sell or allow distributions on capital stock of specified subsidiaries;\n\u25cf enter into transactions with affiliates; or\n\u25cf merge, consolidate or sell our assets.\nAny failure to comply with the restrictions of the credit facilities or any subsequent financing agreements may result in an event of default. Such default may allow our creditors to accelerate the repayment of the related debt and may result in the acceleration of the repayment of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, these creditors may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to provide us with further funds.\nLabor costs and the terms of collective bargaining agreements can negatively impact our ability to remain competitive, which could cause our financial performance to suffer.\nOur four largest markets all have some unionized labor pools and the addition of Alaska Communications brings even more of an operating challenge than we have in other markets given the remote location of operations and the extent of the unionized workforce. Labor costs are a significant component of Alaska Communications\u2019 expenses and, as of December 31, 2021, approximately 55% of its workforce is represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (\u201cIBEW\u201d). The collective bargaining agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d) between Alaska Communications and the IBEW, which is effective through December 31, 2023, governs the terms and conditions of employment for all IBEW represented employees working for Alaska Communications and has significant economic impacts on it as the CBA relates to wage and benefit costs and work rules. We believe Alaska Communications\u2019 labor costs are higher than our competitors who employ a non-unionized workforce because Alaska Communications is required by the CBA to contribute to the IBEW Health and Welfare Trust and the Alaska Electrical Pension Fund (\u201cAEPF\u201d) for benefit programs, including defined benefit pension plans and health benefit plans, that are not reflective of the competitive marketplace. Furthermore, work rules under the existing agreement limit Alaska Communications\u2019 ability to efficiently\nmanage its workforce and make the incremental cost of work performed outside normal work hours high. In addition, Alaska Communications may make strategic and operational decisions that require the consent of the IBEW. In all of our markets, the local union may not provide consent when needed to execute upon strategic new initiatives or cost saving measures, it may require additional wages, benefits or other consideration be paid in return for its consent, or it may call for a work stoppage against our operating companies. Any deterioration in the relationship with our local unions could have a negative impact on our operations and on our ability to achieve our plans for growth.\nAlaska Communications may incur substantial and unexpected liabilities arising out of its pension plans.\nAlaska Communications is required by the CBA to contribute to the AEPF for benefit programs, including defined benefit pension plans and health benefit plans. Alaska Communications also maintains pension benefits for substantially all of its Alaska-based employees. The AEPF is a multi-employer pension plan to which Alaska Communications makes fixed, per employee, contributions through the CBA, which covers the IBEW represented workforce, and a special agreement, which covers most of its non-represented workforce. Because contribution requirements are fixed, Alaska Communications cannot easily adjust annual plan contributions to address its own financial circumstances. Currently, this plan is not fully funded, which means Alaska Communications may be subject to increased contribution obligations, penalties, and ultimately, it could incur a contingent withdrawal liability should it choose to withdraw from the AEPF for economic reasons. Alaska Communications\u2019 contingent withdrawal liability is an amount based on its pro-rata share among AEPF participants of the value of the funding shortfall. This contingent liability becomes due and payable if Alaska Communications terminates its participation in the AEPF. Moreover, if another participant in the AEPF goes bankrupt, Alaska Communications would become liable for a pro-rata share of the bankrupt participant\u2019s vested, but unpaid, liability for accrued benefits for that participant\u2019s employees. This could result in a substantial unexpected contribution requirement and making such a contribution could have a material adverse effect on Alaska Communications\u2019 cash position and other financial results. These sources of potential liability are difficult to predict.\nThese plans and activities have generated and will likely continue to generate substantial cash requirements for Alaska Communications, and these requirements may increase beyond our expectations in future years based on changing market conditions, which could result in substantial liabilities on our balance sheet. The difference between projected plan obligations and assets, or the funded status of the plans, is a significant factor in determining the net periodic benefit costs of these pension plans and the ongoing funding requirements of those plans. Changes in interest rates, mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates, returns on investment and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans. In the future, we may be required to make additional contributions to our defined benefit plans. Plan liabilities may impair our liquidity, have an unfavorable impact on our ability to obtain financing and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our competitors who do not have such liabilities and cash requirements.\nGiven the complexity of pension-related matters we may not, in every instance, be in full compliance with applicable requirements.\nInflation could adversely affect our financial results.\nIf inflation continues or worsens, it could negatively impact our Company by increasing our operating expenses. Inflation may lead to cost increases in multiple areas across our business, for example, rises in the prices of raw materials and manufactured goods, increased energy rates, as well as increased wage pressures and other expenses related to our employees. In particular, where we have agreed to undertake infrastructure build outs on a fixed budget for our carrier customers or by accepting government grants, inflation may result in build costs that exceed our original budget given the long delays experienced in procuring equipment and materials due to global supply chain delays. To the extent that we are unable to pass on these costs through increased prices, revised budget estimates, or offset them in other ways, they may impact our financial condition and cash flows.\nOther Risks\nOur founder is our largest stockholder and could exert significant influence over us.\nCornelius B. Prior, Jr., our founder and the father of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, together with related entities, affiliates and family members (including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer), beneficially owns approximately 26% of our outstanding Common Stock. As a result, he has the ability to exert significant influence over all matters presented to our stockholders for approval, including election and removal of our directors and change of control transactions. His interests may not always coincide with the interests of other holders of our Common Stock.\nLow trading volume of our stock may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to sell shares and/or result in lower sale prices.\nFor the three months prior to March 16, 2022, the average daily trading volume of our Common Stock was approximately 47,000 shares. As a result, our stockholders may have difficulty selling a large number of shares of our Common Stock in the manner or at a price that might be attainable if our Common Stock were more actively traded. In addition, the market price of our Common Stock may not be reflective of its underlying value.\nWe may not pay dividends in the future.\nOur stockholders may receive dividends out of legally available funds if, and when, they are declared by our Board of Directors. We have consistently paid quarterly dividends in the past, but may cease to do so or decrease the dividend amount at any time. Our credit facility sets certain limitations on our ability to pay dividends on, or repurchase, our capital stock. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future that may further restrict our ability to declare and pay dividends. We may also be restricted from paying dividends in the future due to restrictions imposed by applicable state laws, our financial condition and results of operations, capital requirements, management\u2019s assessment of future capital needs and other factors considered by our Board of Directors.\nThe lack of liquidity of our privately held investments may adversely affect our business.\nOur subsidiaries and affiliates are typically private companies whose securities are not traded in any public market. In the past, we have partnered with other equity investors as well, and may have majority or minority holdings in certain investments. Investment agreements for both our majority and minority held subsidiaries often contain investor rights and obligations, such as rights of first refusal, co-sale, and \"drag along\" provisions related to liquidity events and transfers that may force us to sell or exit our holdings at times or on terms that are not optimal or limit our ability to sell or exit our holdings when we would like to. The illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to quickly obtain cash equal to the value at which we record our investments if the need arises to satisfy the repurchase of such investments from our other equity investors in the event such company desires, or in the case of our Alaska Transaction, may be required to repurchase such securities pursuant to contractual arrangements. Such illiquidity could also cause us to miss other investment opportunities. There can also be no assurance that our investments will appreciate in value or that it will have the opportunity to divest such investments at acceptable prices or within the timeline envisaged. If any of the above circumstances arise, it could result in impairments to such investments, and could have a material adverse impact on our earnings, cash flow and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 77090, "SIC": 4812, "TIC": "ATNI"}
