RISK FACTORS\nYou should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating our company and our business. Our future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties and actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below, as well as those factors discussed elsewhere herein. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and stock price.\nRISK RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nThe effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, and stock price.\nThe duration, extent, and impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic remain uncertain and could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, and stock price. The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify aspects of our business practices (including the management of and access to our facilities, employee remote work locations, and employee travel), and we may take further actions, as may be required by federal, state, and local governments or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees and customers. Such actions may disrupt our supply chain, logistics network, operations, facilities, and employee workforce, which could negatively affect our employees' efficiency and productivity; our development and introduction of innovative new products and services; our ability to manufacture, market, sell, and distribute our products and services; and our financial performance. In addition, public health-related guidance and directives, including stay-at-home orders that may be further deployed to combat the spread of COVID-19, including variants (such as Delta and Omicron), and possible higher infection rates could result in a decrease in companion animal clinical visits, labor shortages, the delay of elective procedures and wellness visits, and disruption of veterinary clinic operations, all of which would have a negative effect on veterinary service providers and result in declines in demand for our CAG products and services, which represented 90% of our 2021 consolidated revenues. If stay-at-home orders or other similar public health-related directives are re-implemented periodically to combat the spread of COVID-19, particularly in the United States, the negative impact on veterinary service providers and their businesses, and correspondingly on demand for our CAG products and services, may be material.\nBusiness lockdowns, pool and beach closures and weakened economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic reduced demand for our water testing products in 2020. While our water testing volumes have been recovering during 2021, public health-related guidance and directives that may be further deployed to combat the spread of COVID-19, including variants, may significantly reduce demand. In addition, the ongoing pandemic has increased economic uncertainty and caused economic slowdowns that may continue or recur. Economic weakness in our key geographies related to the COVID-19 pandemic may also reduce demand for our companion animal, water, livestock, poultry and dairy products and services, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWhile demand for our CAG products and services remained strong in 2021, the degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic ultimately impacts us depends on future developments that are unpredictable and most of which are outside of our control, including the duration, scope, and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergence of new variants, changes in infection rates, the vaccine participation rate, the effectiveness of vaccines, the availability of testing kits, as well as regulations and requirements impacting the ability of veterinarians to treat patients, the return to our offices, and/or our ability to visit customer sites. There can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent or mitigate any or all of the COVID-19 near or long-term adverse impacts. Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity, financial conditions, and stock price.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nBecause our business lines are highly attractive, they are also highly competitive. Our failure to successfully execute certain strategies within this competitive environment could have a material negative impact on our future growth and profitability\nThe companion animal healthcare industry is highly competitive, and we anticipate increasing levels of competition from both existing competitors and new sector entrants given our performance and the industry\u2019s strong growth and returns. Our ability to maintain or enhance our growth rates and our profitability depends on our successful execution of many elements of our strategy, including:\n\u2022Developing, manufacturing, and marketing innovative new or improved and cost competitive in-clinic laboratory analyzers that drive sales of IDEXX VetLab instruments, grow our installed base of instruments, and increase demand for related recurring sales of consumable products, services, and accessories;\n\u2022Developing and introducing new innovative diagnostic tests and services for both our reference laboratories and in-clinic applications that provide valuable medical information to our customers and effectively differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors;\n\u2022Developing and introducing innovative, data-insightful software solutions that increase the value to our customers of our companion animal products and services by enhancing the integration of the information and transactions of these products and the management of diagnostic information derived from our products;\n\u2022Maintaining premium pricing, including by effectively implementing price increases, for our differentiated products and services through, among other things, effective communication and promotion of the value of our products and services in an environment where many of our competitors promote, market, and sell lesser offerings at prices lower than ours;\n\u2022Providing our veterinary customers with the medical and business tools, information, and resources that enable them to grow their practices and the utilization of our diagnostic products and services, through increased pet visits, use of preventive care protocols, enhanced practice of real-time care, and improved practice efficiency;\n\u2022Achieving cost improvements in our worldwide network of reference laboratories by implementing global best practices, including lean processing techniques, incorporating technological enhancements, including laboratory automation and a global laboratory information management system, employing purchasing strategies to maximize leverage of our global scale, increasing the leverage of existing infrastructure and consolidating testing in high volume laboratory hubs;\n\u2022Achieving cost improvements in the manufacture and service of our in-clinic laboratory analyzers by employing the benefits of economies of scale in both negotiating supply contracts and leveraging manufacturing overhead, and by improving reliability of our instruments;\n\u2022Continuing to expand, develop, and advance the productivity of our companion animal diagnostic sales, marketing, customer support, and logistics organizations in the U.S. and international regions in support of, among other things, our all-direct sales strategies;\n\u2022Attracting, developing, and retaining key leadership and talent necessary to support all elements of our strategy, which is challenging due to the increasingly competitive and tight labor markets in which we operate, as well as COVID-19-related impacts on the workforce;\n\u2022Strengthening our sales and marketing activities to continue to grow our profitability both in the U.S. and in geographies outside of the U.S.;\n\u2022Identifying, completing, and integrating acquisitions that enhance our existing businesses or create new business or geographic areas for us;\n\u2022Developing and implementing new technology and licensing strategies; and\n\u2022Continuing to effectively manage our growth and expansion on a global scale through, among other things, designing and implementing cost-effective improvements to our processes, procedures, and infrastructure.\nIf we are unsuccessful in implementing and executing on some or all of these strategies, our rate of growth or profitability may be negatively impacted.\nOur dependence on third-party suppliers could limit our ability to sell certain products or negatively affect our operating results\nWe rely on third-party suppliers to provide components and raw materials (including biological materials) for our manufactured products, manufacture some of the products that we sell, and perform certain services, including package-delivery services. Actions taken by third-party suppliers in operating their business, as well as any disruptions to their business operations (or their supplier's business operations), could disrupt our supply chain or operations and materially negatively impact our ability to supply the market, substantially decrease sales, lead to higher costs, and damage our reputation with our customers. Longer-term disruptions could potentially result in the permanent loss of our customers, which could reduce our recurring revenues and long-term profitability.\nOur supply chain and our cost of goods also may be adversely impacted by unanticipated price increases due to factors such as inflation, including wage inflation, or to supply restrictions beyond our control or the control of our suppliers. If current suppliers fail to supply sufficient goods or materials to us on a timely basis, or at all, we could experience inventory shortages and disruptions in our supply of goods or materials.\nFor examples of some of the events that could result in disruption to our supply chain or operations, and negatively impact our operating results, refer to \u201cWe are increasingly dependent on the continuous and reliable operation of our information technology systems, and a disruption of these systems or significant security breaches could adversely affect our business\u201d and \"Factors and events beyond our control could disrupt our operations, supply chain, and logistics network and adversely affect our business\" below.\nIn addition, we currently purchase many products, components, and materials from sole or single sources. Some of these products are proprietary and, therefore, cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources. These products, components, and materials are used in a majority of our instruments, including our Catalyst Dx, Catalyst One, ProCyte Dx, and ProCyte One analyzers; consumables and accessories used in our instruments; livestock and poultry diagnostic tests, dairy testing products, and water testing products. Even if products, components, and materials were to become available to us from alternative suppliers, we likely would incur additional costs and delays in identifying or qualifying replacement materials, and there can be no assurance that replacements would be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. In certain cases, we may be required to obtain regulatory approval to use alternative suppliers, and this process of approval could delay production of our products or development of product candidates indefinitely.\nWe seek to mitigate sole and single-source suppliers risks on a risk-prioritized basis and in a variety of ways, including, when possible, by identifying and qualifying alternative suppliers, developing applicable in-house manufacturing capabilities and expertise, and entering into escrow arrangements for manufacturing information for certain single or sole-sourced products. We also seek to enter into long-term contracts that provide for an uninterrupted supply of products at predictable or fixed prices. However, there can be no assurance that we will successfully implement any of these mitigating activities or that, if implemented, any of them will be effective in preventing any delay or other disruption in our ability to supply our customers. In addition, suppliers may decline to enter into long-term contracts for any number of reasons, which would require us to purchase products, components, or raw materials via short-term contracts or on a purchase order basis. There can be no assurance that suppliers with which we do not have long-term contracts will continue to supply our requirements, will always fulfill their obligations under those contracts, or will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply our requirements. In cases where we purchase sole and single-source products, components, or raw materials under purchase orders, we are more susceptible to unanticipated cost increases or changes in other terms of supply. In addition, under some contracts with suppliers we have minimum purchase obligations, and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these contracts or require us to compensate the supplier. If we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of products, components, or raw materials in the future from sole and single-source suppliers, or if such sole and single-source suppliers are unable to obtain the components or other materials required to manufacture the products, we may be unable to supply our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, and any longer-term disruptions could potentially result in the permanent loss of customers, which could reduce our recurring revenues and long-term profitability.\nOur biologic products are complex and difficult to manufacture, which could negatively affect our ability to supply our customers\nMany of our rapid assay, livestock and poultry diagnostic, water, and dairy products are biologic products that include biological materials, such as antibodies, cells, and sera. Manufacturing biologic products is highly complex due to the inherent variability of biological materials and the difficulty of controlling the interactions of these materials with other components of the products, samples, and the environment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that we will be able to consistently manufacture biologic products that satisfy applicable product release criteria and regulatory requirements. Further, products that meet release criteria at the time of manufacture may fall out of specification while in customer inventory, which could require us to incur expenses associated with recalling products and providing customers with new products, either of which could damage customer relations. Our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could result in our inability to supply our customers with these products, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nVarious U.S. and foreign government regulations could limit or delay our ability to market and sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business\nAs a global business, we sell products and services in more than 175 countries and operate in an increasingly complex legal and regulatory environment. In the U.S., the manufacture and sale of certain of our products are regulated by agencies such as the USDA, the FDA, and the EPA. Our diagnostic tests for animal health applications that involve the detection of infectious diseases, including most rapid assay canine and feline SNAP tests and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests, must be approved by the USDA prior to sale in the U.S. Our dairy testing products as well as the manufacture and sale of our OPTI line of human point-of-care electrolytes and blood gas analyzers require approval by the FDA before they may be sold commercially in the U.S., and our OPTI PCR test kits for the detection of the virus that causes COVID-19, are subject to regulation by the FDA and sold and distributed pursuant to Emergency Use Authorizations issued by the FDA. The methods used by our water testing products must be approved by the EPA, as a part of its water quality monitoring program, before they can be used by customers in the U.S. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades, or any termination, revision, or revocation of an Emergency Use Authorization for our OPTI test kits, could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability.\nThe manufacture, import, and sale of our products, as well as our research and development processes, are subject to similar and sometimes more stringent laws in many foreign countries. For example, the European Union regulates the use of certain substances that we currently use in our products or processes. These regulations include, but are not limited to, the Biocidal Products Regulation, which requires the use of approved biocides in our products prior to being manufactured, used, or sold in the European Union; the European Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances, or REACH, which regulates and restricts the use of chemicals in the European Union; the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (\"RoHS\") Directive, which regulates and restricts certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment; the Electromagnetic Compatibility Directive; and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive.\nCompliance with these and similar regulations in the U.S. and abroad may require registration of the applicable substances or the redesign or reformulation of our products and may reduce or eliminate the availability of certain parts and components used in our products and services in the event our suppliers are unable to comply with the applicable regulations in a timely and cost-effective manner. Any redesign or reformulation or restricted supply of parts and components may negatively affect the availability or performance of our products and services, add testing lead-times for products and reformulated products, reduce our margins, result in additional costs, or have other similar effects. In addition, the costs to comply with these regulations may be significant. Any of these could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. These legal and regulatory requirements are complex and subject to change, and we continue to evaluate their impact.\nIn addition, some foreign governments require us to register or certify our products before they can be distributed or sold, and these product registration requirements, which vary among the applicable jurisdictions and change from time to time, are often complex and require us to engage in lengthy and costly processes and provide confidential, proprietary information about those products to foreign regulatory agencies. For example, compliance with extensive country-specific regulatory processes is required in connection with importing, marketing, and selling our diagnostic products in Japan, Germany, Canada, Brazil, the Netherlands, China, and many other countries. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain any product registration required by one or more foreign governments. Any inability to obtain or maintain a required product registration in a jurisdiction could adversely affect our ability to market and sell the applicable product in that jurisdiction, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. There can also be no assurance that confidential, proprietary information provided to foreign regulatory agencies may not be accessed by\nunauthorized persons or otherwise stolen, which could negatively impact our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our innovative products and our future success. For more information about the risks related to the protection of our proprietary rights in our products and services, refer to \"Our success is heavily dependent on our continued differentiated product and service innovation\" below.\nWe are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations governing, as well as legal and political environments that vary broadly regarding, among other things, the importation and exportation of products; our global business practices, such as anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, and anti-competition laws; and immigration and travel restrictions. These legal, regulatory, and political requirements and environments differ among jurisdictions around the world and are rapidly changing and increasingly complex. The costs associated with compliance with these legal and regulatory requirements and adjusting to changing legal and political environments are significant and likely to increase in the future.\nAny failure by us to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, or to adjust to changing legal and political environments, could result in fines, penalties, and sanctions; product recalls; suspensions or discontinuations of, or limitations or restrictions on, our ability to design, manufacture, market, import, export or sell our products; and damage to our reputation. Any of these could negatively impact our business.\nOur success is heavily dependent on our continued differentiated product and service innovation\nWe believe our future success significantly depends on our ability to continue, on a cost-effective and timely basis, to enhance our existing differentiated product and service offerings and to develop and introduce new and innovative differentiated products and services. As a result, we invest substantial funds and efforts into R&D, investigating new products and technologies being developed by third parties and obtaining certain such new products and technologies through licenses or acquisitions. There can be no assurance that our R&D, licensing, or acquisition efforts will achieve expected results, when or whether any of our products or services now under development will be launched, or whether we may be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire new products or technologies. We also cannot predict whether any product or service offering, once launched, will achieve market acceptance or achieve sales and revenue consistent with our expectations.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, trademark, and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights. We also license patents and technologies from third parties to enable the use of third-party technologies in the development and production of our products and offerings. If we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights or are unable to license third-party patents and technologies on reasonable terms, our business may be adversely affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies to compete with us.\nWe cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents, that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid, or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies. Even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors, the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition for products previously covered by those patent rights.\nIn the past, we have received notices claiming that our products infringe third-party patents, and we may receive such notices in the future. Patent litigation is complex and expensive, and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict. We cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case. If we lose, we may be prohibited from selling certain products and/or we may be required to pay damages and/or ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit. Any such result could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIncreased competition from and technological advances by our competitors could negatively affect our operating results\nWe face intense competition, and we expect that future competition will become even more intense as new products, services and technologies become available and new competitors enter the space. Our competitors in the veterinary diagnostic sector in the United States and abroad include companies that develop, manufacture, and sell veterinary diagnostic tests and commercial veterinary reference laboratories, certain large and well-funded animal health pharmaceutical companies, as well as corporate hospital chains that operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals, such as VCA Inc., which is wholly owned by Mars, Incorporated, another operator of corporate hospital chains. Consolidation among our competitors and our customers may intensify the competition we face. While we believe that our offerings are competitively differentiated due to our innovative products and services (such as the IDEXX SDMA test and VetConnect Plus) that offer an integrated, comprehensive diagnostic solution and the quality of our technical and customer service, there can be no assurance\nthat increased consolidation among our competitors or customers (as well as any resulting reference laboratory vertical integration among our customers) would not have a negative impact on our ability to compete successfully. For more information regarding the risks presented by consolidation and reference laboratory vertical integration among our customers, refer to \u201cConsolidation in our customer base, including through increased corporate hospital ownership, and prevalence of buying consortiums could negatively affect our business\u201d below.\nCompetition could negatively affect our sales and profitability in a number of ways. New competitors may emerge through the development of innovative new technology, the acquisition of rights to use existing technologies or the use of existing technologies when patents protecting such existing technologies expire. New or existing competitors may introduce new, innovative, and competitive products and services, which could be superior, or be perceived by our customers to be superior, to our products and services or lead to the obsolescence of one or more of our products or services. Business combinations and mergers among our competitors may result in competitors that are better positioned to create, market, and sell more compelling product and service offerings. While an important aspect of our strategy is to continue, on a cost-effective and timely basis, to enhance our existing products and services and to develop and introduce new and innovative products and services, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop such products and services or that those products or services will be superior to our competitors\u2019 products or services or otherwise achieve customer acceptance. Some of our competitors and potential competitors may choose to differentiate themselves by offering products and services perceived in the eyes of customers as similar, at substantially lower sales prices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations through loss of sales and/or revenues or a decision to lower our own sales prices to remain competitive. In addition, our ability to attract and retain customers depends on the effectiveness of our customer marketing and incentive programs and multiple competitors could bundle product and service offerings through co-marketing or other arrangements, which could enhance their ability to compete with our broad product and service offering. Certain of our competitors and potential competitors, including large diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies, also have substantially greater financial and managerial resources than us, as well as greater experience in manufacturing, marketing, research and development, and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do.\nConsolidation in our customer base, including through increased corporate hospital ownership, and prevalence of buying consortiums could negatively affect our business\nVeterinarians are our primary customers for our CAG products and services, and the veterinary services industry in the U.S. and abroad has been consolidating at an accelerating rate in recent years. In the United States, the number of owners of veterinary hospitals has been declining, and an increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals are owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals and/or opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally. Major corporate hospital owners in the U.S. include Mars, Incorporated (owner of Banfield Pet Hospitals, Blue Pearl Veterinary Partners, Pet Partners and VCA Inc.), and National Veterinary Associates, and are joined by dozens of other consolidators. A similar trend exists in other regions such as Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, China, and Brazil. Furthermore, an increasing percentage of individually-owned veterinary hospitals in the U.S. are participating in buying consortiums. Corporate owners of veterinary hospitals and buying consortiums often seek to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers, which could have a negative impact on our profitability and results of operations. While we have strong supplier relationships with several corporate hospital groups and buying consortiums, decisions by larger corporate owners and buying consortiums to shift their purchasing of products and services away from us and to a competitor would have a negative impact on our results of operations. In addition, certain corporate owners also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals. Any hospitals acquired by these companies generally attempt to shift all or a large portion of their testing to the reference laboratories operated by these companies, and there can be no assurance that hospitals that otherwise become affiliated with these companies would not shift all or a portion of their testing to such reference laboratories. Furthermore, because these companies compete with us in the reference laboratory services marketplace, hospitals acquired by these companies or those that establish other affiliations with these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services, which would cause our sales of these products and services to decline.\nChanges in testing patterns could negatively affect our operating results\nDemand for our companion animal, livestock and poultry diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors impacting testing practices. The introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing. Changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect. Eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases. Our livestock and poultry products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting\nfrom changes in disease prevalence. The outbreak of certain diseases (such as African swine fever) among livestock or poultry, or the adverse impact of climate change-related events (such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, and floods), could lead to the widespread death or precautionary destruction of such animals in the affected regions, reducing herd or flock sizes, which could reduce the demand for our testing products for such animals. Changes in government regulations or in the availability of government funds available for monitoring programs could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing, such as our livestock and poultry, dairy and water products. In addition, changes and trends in local dairy, poultry, or other food sectors around the world could negatively affect the related production markets resulting in a decline in demand for our testing products. Economic weakness (whether or not related to the COVID-19 pandemic) may also reduce demand for our companion animal, water, livestock, poultry, and dairy products and services, and public health-related guidance and directives, including stay-at-home orders that may be further deployed to combat the spread of COVID-19, and possible higher infection rates could result in a decrease in companion animal clinical visits, the delay of elective procedures and wellness visits and disruption of veterinary clinic operations, all of which would have a negative effect on veterinary service providers and result in declines in demand for our CAG products and services. Declines in testing for any reason, including the reasons described above, along with lost opportunities associated with a reduction in veterinary visits, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe sell many products through distributors, which presents risks that could negatively affect our operating results\nSome of our international product sales occur through third-party distributors. As a result, we are dependent on these distributors to promote and create demand for our products. Our distributors often offer products from several different companies, including our competitors, and may promote our competitors\u2019 products over our own products. We have limited ability, if any, to cause our distributors to devote adequate resources to promoting, marketing, selling, and supporting our products or to maintain certain inventory levels, and changes in our distributors\u2019 inventory levels, as compared to comparable prior periods, could negatively impact our revenue growth rates. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining and strengthening our relationships with our distributors or establishing relationships with new distributors who have the ability to market, sell, and support our products effectively. We may rely on one or more key distributors for a product or a region, and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue. Distributors may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. While we maintain a rigorous distribution compliance program, violations of anti-corruption or similar laws by our distributors could have a material impact on our business and reputation, and any termination of a distributor relationship may result in increased competition in the applicable jurisdiction. Failure to manage the risks associated with our use of distributors outside of the U.S. may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position, any of which could have a negative effect on our operating results.\nOur limited experience and small scale in the human point-of-care and related human laboratory diagnostics sector could inhibit our success in this sector\nWe have limited experience in the human point-of-care and related human laboratory medical diagnostics sector, and we operate at a small scale in this area. This sector differs in many respects from the veterinary diagnostic sector. Significant differences include the impact of third-party reimbursement on diagnostic testing, more extensive regulation, greater product liability risks, larger competitors, a more segmented customer base, and more rapid technological innovation. Our limited experience and small scale in the human point-of-care and laboratory medical diagnostics sector could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this sector that differ from the veterinary diagnostic sector. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human point-of-care and laboratory medical diagnostics sector comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary diagnostic sector.\nGENERAL RISKS\nWe depend on key leadership and talent to succeed and compete effectively\nOur continued success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract, develop, and retain highly capable, skilled and diverse employees and leaders. As we continue to grow our business, expand our geographic scope, and develop and offer innovative, new products and services, we require an engaged, qualified workforce and the organizational talent necessary to ensure effective succession for our senior leadership and other key personnel. Competition for experienced leaders and employees, particularly for persons with specialized skills, can be intense. Our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors, including compensation and benefits, work location, work environment and development opportunities. Furthermore, the recent pandemic-related labor force shortages have made it more difficult and costly to attract qualified labor, and prolonged shortages could adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives.\nThe loss of the services of, or our failure to recruit or develop and implement effective succession plans for, our senior leadership or other key personnel may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our strategic objectives, disrupt our operations, and adversely affect our business and our future success. In addition, even if we effectively develop and implement succession plans and make key leadership transitions, we cannot provide assurances as to whether we may experience management or other challenges in connection with any of those leadership transitions that could adversely affect our future success.\nWe are increasingly dependent on the continuous and reliable operation of our information technology systems, and a disruption of these systems or significant security breaches could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on our information systems, as well as our third-party business partners\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 information systems, to provide access to our web-based products and services, keep financial records, analyze results of operations, process customer orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers, store confidential or proprietary information and operate other critical functions. Although we maintain security policies, employ system backup measures and engage in redundancy planning and processes, such policies, measures, planning and processes, as well as our current disaster recovery plans, may be ineffective or inadequate to address all eventualities. Further, our information systems and our business partners' and suppliers' information systems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers and other security breaches, including, among other things, computer viruses and malware, ransomware, denial of service actions, misappropriation of data and similar events through the internet (including via devices and applications connected to the internet), and through email attachments and persons with access to these information systems, such as our employees or third parties with whom we do business. Due to governmental mandates and recommended safety measures to control the spread of COVID-19, we modified aspects of our business practices. This has resulted in a greater number of our employees working remotely for extended periods of time, which may result in some increased risk of vulnerability or attacks associated with additional individuals accessing our data and systems remotely. In addition, security industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cybersecurity attacks targeting U.S. organizations conducting COVID-19-related research, such as IDEXX.\nAs information systems and the use of software and related applications by us, our business partners, suppliers, and customers become more cloud-based and connected to the \u201cInternet of Things,\u201d which is inherently susceptible to cyberattacks, there has been an increase in global cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats, including more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks that pose a risk to the security of our information systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data and information. We process credit card payments electronically over secure networks and also offer products and services that connect to and are part of the \u201cInternet of Things,\u201d such as our connected devices (e.g., IDEXX VetLab instruments). Any such attack or breach could compromise our networks and the information stored thereon could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. While we have implemented network security and internal control measures, especially for the purpose of protecting our connected products and services from cyberattacks, and invested in our data and information technology infrastructure, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent a system disruption, attack, or security breach and, as such, the risk of system disruptions and security breaches from a cyberattack remains.\nWe, and some of our third-party vendors, have experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past and may experience further attacks in the future, potentially with more frequency. To our knowledge, most of these attacks have been unsuccessful, and none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations. We have adopted measures to mitigate potential risks associated with information technology disruptions and cybersecurity threats; however, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions and the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, which vary in technique and sources, if we or our business partners or suppliers were to experience a system disruption, attack or security breach that impacts any of our critical functions, or our customers were to experience a system disruption, attack or security breach via any of our connected products and services, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks, financial losses and additional costs from remedial actions, repairs to infrastructure, physical systems or data processing systems, increased cybersecurity and information technology protection costs, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Our customers could also face negative consequences such as the compromises of sensitive or critical information or systems. Furthermore, any access to, public disclosure of, or other loss of data or information (including any of our confidential or proprietary information or personal data or information) as a result of an attack or security breach could result in governmental actions or private claims or proceedings, which could damage our reputation, cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, damage our ability to develop (and protect our rights to) our differentiated technologies and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations or prospects. For more information regarding data and information privacy and protection risks, refer to \u201cOur operations and reputation may be impaired if we, our products, or our services do not comply with our global privacy policy or evolving laws and regulations regarding data privacy and protection\u201d below.\nFactors and events beyond our control could disrupt our operations, supply chain, and logistics network and adversely affect our business\nOur business and results of operations could be negatively affected by certain factors and events beyond our control, such as natural disasters, severe weather conditions and/or climate change-related events (such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, and floods); public health issues (such as outbreaks, epidemics, or pandemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic); civil unrest; geopolitical conditions and developments; war, terrorism, or other man-made disasters; increases in wages that drive up prices; workforce disruptions; labor shortages or stoppages; the imposition of regulations, trade protection measures, tariffs, duties, import/export restrictions, quotas or embargoes on key components; transportation failures affecting the supply and shipment of materials and finished goods; and the unavailability of raw materials. Any of these events could result in, among other things, damage to or the temporary closure of one or more of our manufacturing or distribution facilities or reference laboratories (damage to one of our facilities or the manufacturing equipment we use could be costly and may require substantial lead-time to repair or replace); damage to or closure of one or more facilities of our third-party business partners or suppliers on which we rely; a temporary lack of an adequate work force in one or more markets; an interruption in power supply; a temporary or long-term disruption in our supply chain or logistics network (including a disruption to our ability to obtain critical components for the manufacture of our products); a temporary disruption in our ability to deliver (or delays in the delivery of) our products or services; and short- or long-term damage to our customers\u2019 businesses (which would adversely impact customer demand for our products and services). For more information regarding the risks presented by disruption to our suppliers\u2019 operations and supply chain, refer to \u201cOur dependence on third-party suppliers could limit our ability to sell certain products or negatively affect our operating results\u201d above.\nWe manufacture many of our significant companion animal products, including our rapid assay devices and certain instruments, many of our water testing products and certain of our livestock, poultry, and dairy testing products, at a single facility in Westbrook, Maine. Certain of our companion animal products, as well as our human point-of-care products, are manufactured in Roswell, Georgia. We also manufacture certain of our livestock and poultry testing products in Bern, Switzerland and Montpellier, France. In addition, we maintain major distribution facilities in North America and in the Netherlands and major reference laboratories in Memphis, Tennessee; Kornwestheim, Germany; Sacramento, California; Elmhurst, Illinois; North Grafton, Massachusetts; East Brisbane, Australia; Markham, Ontario; Wetherby, U.K.; and Tokyo, Japan. Interruption of operations at any of these facilities due to the occurrence of one or more of the events described above could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWhile we maintain plans to continue business under such circumstances, there can be no assurance that such plans will be successful in fully or partially mitigating the effects of such events. We also maintain property and business interruption insurance to insure against the financial impact of certain events of this nature. However, this insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for the full amount of any losses that we may incur. In addition, such insurance will not compensate us for potential long-term competitive effects of being out of the market for the period of any interruption in operations.\nRisks associated with doing business internationally could negatively affect our operating results\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 38% of our overall revenue and approximately 35%, 89% and 52% of our CAG, LPD, and Water revenues, respectively, were attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the U.S. Although we intend to continue to expand our international operations and business, we may not be able to successfully promote, market, import, export, sell, or distribute our products and services outside the U.S. Various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales, including, but not limited to, disruptions in transportation of our products or our supply chain; fluctuations in oil prices; increased border protection and restriction on travel; the differing product and service needs of foreign customers; difficulties in building, staffing, and managing foreign operations (including a geographically dispersed workforce); differing protection of intellectual property; trade protection measures, quotas, embargoes, import/export restrictions, tariffs, duties, and regulatory and licensing requirements; natural and other disasters; public health issues (such as outbreaks, epidemics, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or the prospect of a pandemic); ongoing instability or changes in a country\u2019s or region\u2019s regulatory, economic, or political conditions; other unfavorable geopolitical conditions; security concerns; and local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices prohibited by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations.\nIn addition, to market and sell many of our products outside the U.S., we are subject to product approval and registration requirements that often require us to provide confidential, proprietary information about those products to foreign regulatory agencies. There can be no assurance that the confidential, proprietary information provided to foreign regulatory agencies to comply with product approval and registration requirements may not be accessed by unauthorized persons or otherwise stolen, which could negatively affect our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our innovative products and our future success. We also may forgo marketing and selling some of our products in certain foreign jurisdictions due to the risk of intellectual property theft, which could negatively affect our ability to expand our international operations and business. For more information about the risks related to the protection of our proprietary rights in our products and services, refer to \"Our success is heavily dependent on our continued differentiated product and service innovation\" above.\nFurther, prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the U.S. due to competitive, market or other factors, or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our results of operations are also susceptible to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As a result, the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have an adverse impact on our results of operations for that period.\nOur operations and reputation may be impaired if we, our products, or our services do not comply with our global privacy policy or evolving laws and regulations regarding data privacy and protection\nThe nature of our business involves the receipt, storage and use of information, including personal data, about our customers, pet owners, suppliers, and employees. We collect and use personal data in a variety of ways. We offer products and services that collect and use personal data, including veterinary practice management systems, online customer communication tools and services, VetConnect PLUS, and two-way integration technology. Some of these products and services rely on third-party providers for cloud storage. We also engage in e-commerce through various websites and collect contact and other personal data from our customers and website visitors. In addition, we transfer information, including personal data, among IDEXX, our subsidiaries and third parties with which we have commercial relations for business purposes. Our collection, protection, security, retention, storage, disclosure, sharing and use of personal data described above are subject to expanding and increasingly complex laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad. In addition, these laws and regulations continue to develop and are subject to frequent revisions (and generally have become more stringent over time), are subject to differing interpretations, may be applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may be inconsistent with our current global privacy policy and data protection practices. Compliance with these evolving requirements can be costly, require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business or delay or impede the development and offering of innovative products and services. Additionally, public perception and standards related to the privacy of personal data can shift rapidly, in ways that may affect our reputation or influence regulators in the U.S. and abroad to expand or adopt more stringent regulations and laws. Examples of laws and regulations that have impacted or could impact our business include:\n\u2022The California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective in January 2020, gives California residents, among other things, expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches. Moreover, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (\"CPRA\"), which is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2023 (with a lookback to January 1, 2022), will significantly modify the CCPA, and will impose additional data protection obligations on companies such as ours doing business in California. Similarly, other states such as Virginia and Colorado, have instituted privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, and many similar laws have been proposed at the federal and state level, all of which may have potentially conflicting requirements that would make compliance challenging. The effects of the CCPA, CRPA, and other similar laws may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply.\n\u2022The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), which became effective in May 2018, imposes stringent operational requirements for controllers and processors of personal data of individuals in the European Economic Area (\"EEA\"), and noncompliance can trigger fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of global annual revenues.\n\u2022Following the United Kingdom\u2019s (\"UK\") withdrawal from the EEA and the EU on December 31, 2020, we became subject to the GDPR as incorporated into the United Kingdom law \"UK GDPR\"), and noncompliance can trigger fines of up to the greater of \u00a317.5 million or 4% of global turnover. The European Commission adopted a UK adequacy decision in June 2021 which organizations can rely on for EEA to UK personal data transfers. This decision will automatically expire four years after its entry into force, but it might be renewed provided the UK maintains an adequate level of data protection. The relationship between the UK and the EU in relation to certain aspects of data\nprotection law remains unclear, however, and it is unclear how UK data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term, and how data transfers to and from the UK will be regulated in the long term. Any changes to these laws may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply.\n\u2022In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shields calling into question data transfers carried out under the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses (\u201cSCCs\u201d), which has created compliance challenges for our transfer of personal data from the EEA and/or Switzerland to the U.S. and other third countries. The European Commission updated the SCCs on June 4, 2021, and additional regulatory guidance has been released that seeks to impose additional obligations on companies seeking to rely on the SCCs for such transfers. Parties transferring personal data from the EEA to third countries with \u201cinadequate data protection\u201d such as the U.S. will have until December 27, 2022 to update any existing agreements, or any new agreements executed before September 27, 2021, that rely on SCCs. The new SCCs apply only to the transfer of data outside of the EEA and not the UK, though on January 31, 2022, the UK\u2019s Information Commissioner\u2019s Officer announced that proposals for the U.K.'s own form of agreement and addendum to the E.U. SCCs (the \"U.K. SCCs\") which could be used for transfers for data from the U.K., have been laid before Parliament. If no objections are raised in Parliament and the proposals are approved, the U.K. SCCs will come into force on March 21, 2022 (subject to a grace period for implementation). Any transfers by us or our vendors of personal data from the EEA/UK may not comply with EEA/UK data protection laws, may increase our exposure to the GDPR\u2019s/UK GDPR\u2019s heightened sanctions for violations of its cross-border data transfer restrictions and may reduce demand for our products from companies subject to European/United Kingdom data protection laws. Similar laws have been proposed or passed in other countries, which may create additional compliance challenges for cross-border transfers of personal data.\n\u2022In August 2021, China passed the new China Personal Information Protection Law (\"PIPL\"), which became effective November 2021. The PIPL provides a comprehensive set of data privacy and protection requirements that apply to the processing of personal information and expands data protection compliance obligations to cover the processing of personal information of persons by organizations and individuals in China, and the processing of personal information of persons in China outside of China if such processing is for purposes of providing products and services to, or analyzing and evaluating the behavior of, persons in China. Several PIPL requirements (such as data localization requirements and international cross border transfer restrictions) remain unclear as the processing amount thresholds for these requirements have not been implemented by the Chinese authorities yet. These thresholds could result in data localization practices that may complicate our operations and create additional compliance challenges for cross-border transfers of personal information. This may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply. The PIPL provides a comprehensive set of data privacy and protection requirements that apply to the processing of personal information and expands data protection compliance obligations to cover the processing of personal information of persons by organizations and individuals in China, and the processing of personal information of persons in China outside of China if such processing is for purposes of providing products and services to, or analyzing and evaluating the behavior of, persons in China.\n\u2022The Brazilian General Data Protection Law (\u201cLGPD\u201d), which became effective in September 2020, and the South African Protection of Personal Information Act (\"POPIA\"), which became effective in July 2020 (with a one-year grace period until June 30, 2021), and the Amendments to the Japanese Act on the Protection of Personal Information (\"APPI\") which will enter into full effect in April 2022, are examples of other non-U.S. data privacy-related laws to which we are subject.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us, the third parties with whom we work or our products and services to comply with all applicable privacy-related laws and regulations, as well as our contractual obligations, could result in damage to our reputation or legal proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, retention, disclosure, or security of personal data or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded and even if we are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, could damage our reputation and harm our business.\nFuture operating results could be negatively affected by changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities\nThe nature of our global operations subjects us to local, state, regional and federal tax laws in jurisdictions around the world. Our future tax expense could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Additionally, tax\nrules governing cross-border activities are continually subject to modification as a result of coordinated actions by governments and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (\"OECD\") and unilateral measures designed by individual countries, both intended to tackle concerns over base erosion and profit shifting (\"BEPS\") and perceived international tax avoidance techniques.\nIn April 2021, the current U.S. administration proposed comprehensive corporate tax reforms, including (among other things) an increased tax rate and the promotion of a global minimum tax rate. In addition, in June 2021, finance leaders of the Group of Seven countries agreed to back a new global minimum tax rate that would apply regardless of the location of headquarters or physical presence, and in October 2021, 136 countries (including all Group of Twenty countries) agreed to the OECD\u2019s global corporate tax reform plan, which would aim to modify the determination of taxable presence for digital activities and provide for a global minimum tax rate. Furthermore, in December 2021, the Dutch Government modified its tax laws and regulations, eliminating the benefits under our Dutch tax ruling for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2021.\nWhile we have taken, and may take further, actions intended to align our corporate structure and intercompany relationships with supporting our growth in international markets and maintaining operational and tax efficiency and continue to consider all of these developments within our overall tax strategy, changes in tax law in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate or have a presence may materially and adversely impact our income tax liability, provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and results of operation, and there can be no assurance that any actions we take to maintain operational and tax efficiency will effectively mitigate these impacts. Moreover, these actions may increase our operating costs, and if ineffectual, could increase our income tax liabilities and our global effective tax rate.\nOur income tax filings are regularly under audit by various tax authorities, and the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. We regularly assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. Any reduction in these contingent liabilities or additional assessments would increase or decrease income, respectively, in the period such determination is made.\nA weak worldwide economy could result in reduced demand for our products and services or increased customer credit risk\nA substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary industry. Demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the number of patient visits to veterinary hospitals and the practices of veterinarians with respect to the recommendations for diagnostic testing, as well as pet owner compliance with these recommendations. Pet owners generally pay cash out of pocket for health care services for their pets from veterinary practices. The ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic has increased economic uncertainty and caused economic slowdowns that may continue or recur. Economic weakness in our significant geographies could cause pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary hospitals or affect their willingness to approve certain diagnostic tests, comply with a treatment plan or, even more fundamentally, continue to own a pet. In addition, concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests, and concerns about the economy may cause veterinarians to defer purchasing capital items such as our instruments and systems. These conditions, if they continue, could result in a decrease in sales or decrease in sales growth, of diagnostic products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nDemand for our water products is driven in part by the availability of funds at government laboratories, water utilities, and private certified laboratories that utilize our products. Availability of funds also affects demand by government laboratories and cattle, swine and poultry producers that utilize our livestock and poultry diagnostic products, and by users of our human diagnostic products and services. Economic weakness related to the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic has caused and could continue to cause our customers to reduce their investment in such testing, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nA weak economy may also cause deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors and customers, which could inhibit their ability to pay us amounts owed for products delivered or services provided in a timely fashion or at all.\nStrengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar has a negative effect on our business\nWe are a global business, with 38% of our revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021, attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside of the U.S. Any strengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, and in particular the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, Australian dollar and Brazilian real, adversely affects our results, as it reduces the dollar value of sales and profits that are made in those currencies. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar has a greater adverse effect on the profits from products manufactured or sourced in U.S. dollars that are exported to international markets and a lesser effect on profits from foreign sourced products and services due to a natural hedge from international expenses denominated in the corresponding foreign currencies.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 23% of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured or sourced in U.S. dollars and sold internationally in local currencies, as compared to 21% for the year ended December 31, 2020, and 22% for the year ended December 31, 2019. A strengthening U.S. dollar could also negatively impact the ability of customers outside the U.S. to pay for purchases denominated in U.S. dollars as well as affect our overall competitiveness in international markets. The accumulated impacts from any continued, longer-term growth in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Refer to \u201cPart II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding currency impact.\nOur foreign currency hedging activities (refer to \"Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 19. Hedging Instruments\" in the accompanying Notes to consolidated financial statements), which are designed to minimize and delay, but not to eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, may not sufficiently offset the adverse financial effect of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates on our financial results over the limited time the hedges are in place. In addition, our hedging activities involve costs and risks, such as transactions costs and the risk that our hedging counterparties will default on their obligations.\nWe primarily hedge intercompany product purchases and sales denominated in the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, and Australian dollar. Other foreign currency exposures related to foreign sourced services and emerging markets may not be practical to hedge. In certain cases, these exposures are not offset by foreign currency denominated costs. As we primarily use foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months and enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions on a quarterly basis for the current and following year, the effectiveness of our foreign currency hedging activities to offset longer-term appreciation in the value of the U.S. dollar against non-U.S. currencies may be limited. Factors that could affect the effectiveness of our hedging activities include accuracy of sales and other forecasts, volatility of currency markets, and the cost and availability of hedging instruments. Since our hedging activities are designed to minimize volatility, they not only temporarily reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, but they also temporarily reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. Our future financial results could be significantly affected by a strengthening value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities.\nRestrictions in our debt agreements or our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms may increase our cost of borrowing and limit our activities\nOur ability to make scheduled payments and satisfy our other obligations under our Credit Facility and senior notes depends on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flows to meet these obligations or generate sufficient levels of earnings to satisfy the applicable affirmative, negative, and financial covenants. Our failure to comply with these covenants and the other terms of the Credit Facility and senior notes could result in an event of default and acceleration of our obligations under these agreements, which may require us to seek additional financing or restructure existing debt on unfavorable terms. In addition, adverse changes in credit markets could increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing, which could limit our ability to execute certain strategies and have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profitability.\nOur senior notes include provisions which stipulate a prepayment penalty for which we will be obligated in the event that we elect to repay the notes prior to their stated maturity dates. Should we elect to repay some or all of the outstanding principal balance on our senior notes, the prepayment penalty we incur could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe fund our operations, capital purchase requirements and strategic growth needs through cash on hand, funds generated from operations, amounts available under our Credit Facility and senior note financings. If we are unable to obtain financing on favorable terms, we could face restrictions that would limit our ability to execute certain strategies, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profitability.\nBorrowings under our Credit Facility bear interest at variable rates, including rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), exposing us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations under our variable-rate Credit Facility would increase even if the principal amount borrowed remained the same. Our Credit Facility includes a provision for the determination of one or more benchmark replacement rates (including based on the secured overnight financing rate (\"SOFR\")) as a successor to the LIBOR rate.\nRISKS RELATED TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIES\nFluctuations in our quarterly or annual results may cause our stock price to decline\nOur prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including seasonality of certain product lines; changes in our accounting estimates; the impact of acquisitions; timing of distributor purchases product launches, operating expenditures, and customer marketing and incentive programs; changes in the number and type of competitors and their product offerings; changes in our sales and distribution model; changes in the economy affecting consumer spending; and other matters. Similarly, our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to these and other factors. If our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in future periods, our stock price may fall.\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid\nThe trading price of our common stock may be volatile. Securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as other general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of our common stock rapidly and unexpectedly, in spite of our operating performance. Factors that may impact the market price of our common stock include the factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, as well as:\n\u2022Our stock repurchase program and changes in our capital structure, including the issuance of additional debt;\n\u2022Public announcements (including the timing of these announcements) regarding our business, financial performance and prospects or new products or services, product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us;\n\u2022Trading activity in our stock, including portfolio transactions in our stock by us, our executive officers and directors, and significant stockholders; trading activity that results from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which we may be included, such as the S&P 500 Index; trading activity related to our inclusion in, or removal from, any stock indices; and short interest in our common stock, which could be significant from time to time;\n\u2022Investor perception of us and the industry and sectors in which we operate, including changes in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by securities analysts; and whether or not we meet earnings estimates of securities analysts who follow us; and\n\u2022General financial, domestic, international, economic, and market conditions, including overall fluctuations in the U.S. equity markets, which may experience extreme volatility that, in some cases, is unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies.", "PERMNO": 76709, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "IDXX"}
