{"cik": "894627", "company": "VAALCO ENERGY INC /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this report. If any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Additional risks not presently known to us or which we consider immaterial based on information currently available to us may also materially adversely affect us.\nDue to our substantial liquidity concerns, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nOur annual revenues from oil and natural gas sales decreased from $127.7 million for 2014 to $80.4 million for 2015. Our total cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015 were $25.4 million, decreasing from $69.1 million as of December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015, we had a working capital deficit of $3.0 million. If oil and natural gas prices continue to remain at current depressed levels, we expect that for 2016 we will not generate adequate revenue to cover our operating expenses, we will generate losses from operations, and our cash flows will not be sufficient to cover our operating expenses. We currently require additional capital to execute our business plan and continue as a going concern. If we are unable to obtain capital funding, our business operations will be harmed, and we may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nThe operation of the terms of our existing revolving credit loan agreement may also adversely impact our liquidity. As of December 31, 2015 (and as of March 16, 2016), we had outstanding borrowings of $15.0 million under our revolving credit facility. In March 2016, we announced that the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility had been reduced to $20.1 million at December 31, 2015. The International Finance Corporation (\u201cIFC\u201d), our lender under the revolving credit facility, has communicated to us that if we were to seek additional drawdowns before the next scheduled redetermination date as of June 30, 2016, the IFC could elect, under the terms of the loan agreement, to conduct an interim redetermination which it believes would result in a borrowing base of less than $20.1 million if commodity prices are lower than they were at December 31, 2015. Therefore, we currently have very limited, if any, borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. A continuation of prevailing low price levels for oil and natural gas may cause the IFC to make further reductions in the borrowing base under the credit facility.\nIf we fail to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness or trade payables, or fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the loan agreement governing our revolving credit facility, an event of default could result, which would permit acceleration of such debt and which could result in an event of default under the facility and acceleration of other indebtedness, and could permit our secured lender to foreclose on any of our assets securing that debt. Any accelerated debt would become immediately due and payable.\nOur current financial condition and the short-term outlook for our business operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.\nOur ability to borrow funds and to obtain additional capital on reasonable terms is substantially dependent on oil and natural gas prices. The prices of oil and natural gas declined dramatically in the second half of 2014 and remained low, decreasing further in 2015. Average prices for our crude oil sales have fallen from $103.23 per barrel in June 2014 to $33.56 per barrel in December 2015. As a result, our revenues decreased from $127.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $80.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nContinued depressed oil and natural gas prices or further declines in oil and natural gas prices for 2016 and thereafter would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and on the carrying value of our proved reserves.\nWe currently require additional capital to execute our business plan and continue as a going concern. If we are unable to obtain funding, our business operations will be harmed, and we may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nWe will require additional capital to continue to operate our business, expand our exploration and development programs, and continue as a going concern. Any future acquisitions and future exploration, development, production, leasing activities and marketing activities, as well as our administrative requirements, will require a substantial amount of additional capital and cash flow. We may pursue additional capital through various financial transactions or arrangements, and are considering multiple alternatives, including, but not limited to, additional debt or equity financing, a sale or farm-downs of assets, joint ventures, rescheduling discretionary portions of our capital spending to future periods or operating cost reductions. There can be no guarantee of future capital acquisition or fundraising success. Additionally, our current financial position, our current lack of cash resources and our potential inability to continue as a going concern could materially adversely affect our common share prices and our ability to obtain additional financing or new capital from sales of our capital stock.\nOil and natural gas prices are highly volatile, and continued depressed prices will negatively affect our financial results.\nOur revenues, cash flow, profitability, oil and natural gas reserves value and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas. Our ability to borrow funds and to obtain additional capital on reasonable terms is also substantially dependent on oil and natural gas prices. Historically, world-wide oil and natural gas prices and markets have been volatile, and may continue to be volatile in the future. In particular, the prices of oil and natural gas declined dramatically in the second half of 2014 and decreased further in 2015. During 2014, based on New York Mercantile Exchange (\u201cNYMEX\u201d) pricing, the spot price per Bbl of West Texas Intermediate crude oil ranged from a high of $107.26 to a low of $53.45, and the Henry Hub spot price per Mcf of natural gas ranged from a high of $6.00 to a low of $3.48. During 2015, the spot price per Bbl of West Texas Intermediate crude oil ranged from a high of $61.36 to a low of $34.55, and the Henry Hub spot price per Mcf of natural gas ranged from a high of $2.99 to a low of $1.93.\nAs a result of the substantial decline in oil and natural gas prices, our revenues, operating income, cash flows and borrowing capacity have been materially and adversely affected and have required reductions in the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties and our planned level of capital expenditures. The average price at which we sold oil in 2015 was $47.85 per Bbl compared to $93.66 per Bbl in 2014, and $108.35 per Bbl in 2013. Because the oil price we are required to use by the SEC to estimate our future net cash flows is the average price over the 12 months prior to the date of determination of future net cash flows, the full effect of falling prices may not be reflected in our estimated net cash flows for several quarters. We review the carrying value of our properties on a quarterly basis and once incurred, a write-down in the carrying value of our properties is not reversible at a later date, even if oil and natural gas prices increase.\nPrices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, increases in supplies from U.S. shale production, international political conditions, including uprisings and political unrest in the Middle East and Africa, the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the level of consumer demand due to slowing economic growth in China and continued weak economic growth in Europe, weather conditions, domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes, the price and availability of alternative fuels, the health of international economic and credit markets, the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) and other state-controlled oil companies to agree upon and maintain oil price and production controls, and general economic conditions. In addition, various factors, including the effect of federal, state and foreign regulation of production and transportation, general economic conditions, changes in supply due to drilling by other producers and changes in demand may adversely affect our ability to market our oil and natural gas production.\nFurther reductions in our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility as a result of periodic borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our ability to fund our operations, and we may not have sufficient funds to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility if required as a result of a borrowing base redetermination.\nAs of December 31, 2015 (and at March 16, 2016), we had outstanding borrowings of $15.0 million under our revolving credit facility. Availability under our revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base which is subject to scheduled semiannual and other elective collateral borrowing base redeterminations based on the value of our oil and natural gas reserves as determined by the IFC, the lender under the credit facility, and other factors deemed relevant by it. We announced in March 2016 that our borrowing base had been redetermined by the IFC and reduced from $65.0 million to $20.1 million effective December 31, 2015. This reduction was primarily a result of the lower anticipated oil and natural gas prices used to determine our commitment amount. Continued low or declining prices for oil and natural gas may cause the IFC to reduce further the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility.\nThe IFC has also communicated to us that if we were to seek additional drawdowns under the credit facility before the next scheduled borrowing base redetermination date (as of June 30, 2016), it could elect, under the terms of the loan agreement, to conduct an interim redetermination which it believes would result in a borrowing base of less than $20.1 million, if prevailing commodity prices are lower than they were at December 31, 2015.\nAny further reductions in our borrowing base as a result of borrowing base redeterminations, or otherwise, would likely negatively impact our liquidity and our ability to fund our operations and, as a result, would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation and cash flow. Further if, the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were to exceed the borrowing base as a result of any such redetermination, we would be required to repay the excess. We may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments. If we do not have sufficient funds and we are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing, we may have to sell significant assets. Any such sale could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFor additional information regarding our revolving credit facility and our long-term indebtedness, see Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -Capital Resources and Liquidity\u201d and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOur revolving credit facility loan agreement imposes significant restrictions on our current and future operations. If we default under the loan agreement, the lender may act to accelerate our indebtedness, which would impact our ability to conduct our business and results of operations.\nOur credit agreement contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, which may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best interests. These covenants including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u00b7\nincur additional indebtedness, guarantee debt or enter into any arrangement to assume or become obligated for financial or other obligations of another (except pursuant to a joint operating agreement);\n\u00b7\npay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of, or purchase or redeem, shares of our capital stock;\n\u00b7\nprepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u00b7\nmake loans, investments and other restricted payments;\n\u00b7\nsell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets;\n\u00b7\ncreate or incur liens;\n\u00b7\nsell, transfer or lease all or a substantial part of our assets (other than inventory or depleted or obsolete assets in the ordinary course of business);\n\u00b7\nenter into non-arm\u2019s-length transactions;\n\u00b7\nincur or commit to make certain expenditures for fixed or other non-current assets;\n\u00b7\nenter into lease agreements or arrangements, other than the FPSO contract and leases necessary to carry on our business;\n\u00b7\nform any subsidiary;\n\u00b7\nterminate, amend or grant consents or waivers with respect to certain material contracts.\n\u00b7\nuse the proceeds of loans other than as permitted by the credit agreement;\n\u00b7\nreduce certain of our working interests;\n\u00b7\nmodify our organizational documents;\n\u00b7\nalter the business we conduct;\n\u00b7\nundertake or permit any merger, spin-off, consolidation or reorganization; and\n\u00b7\nenter into any derivative transaction without prior approval.\nIn addition, the loan agreement includes certain financial ratios, including;\n\u00b7\na debt service coverage ratio of (i) net cash flows, plus the balance in an operating account) to (ii) debt service obligations, of at least 1.2:1 on the first day of the determination period;\n\u00b7\nloan-life coverage ratios with respect to (i) the present values of (a) projected net cash flow, plus (b) certain projected capital expenditures, to (ii) the aggregate amounts of the loans outstanding under the revolving credit facility in the determination period;\n\u00b7\nfield-life coverage ratios with respect to (i) projected net cash flow up to a field-life end date for our reserves, to (ii) the aggregate amounts of the loans outstanding in the determination period; and\n\u00b7\na ratio of (i) net debt as of the end of a fiscal quarter to (ii) earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, and exploration expenses (EBITDAX) for the trailing 12 months ended on the most recent quarter end, at less than 3.0:1.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants under our revolving credit facility. However, we can make no assurance that we will be able to continue to comply with these financial covenants in the future. Failure to maintain these covenants or otherwise negotiate amendments to the credit facility could preclude us from borrowing under our credit facility and require us to immediately pay down any outstanding drawn amounts under the credit facility.\nThese covenants have the effect of restricting our ability to engage in certain actions, including potentially limiting our ability to sell assets, make future borrowings under the revolving credit facility or incur other additional indebtedness. Our ability to meet our net debt to EBITDAX ratio and our different coverage ratio requirements can be affected by events beyond our control, including changes in commodity prices. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with these covenants in future periods. In addition, if we receive any additional waivers or amendments to our revolving credit facility loan agreement, the lender may impose additional operating and financial restrictions on us.\nA breach of the covenants under our revolving credit facility loan agreement could result in an event of default under the agreement. Such a default may allow the lender to accelerate payment of the indebtedness under the facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the credit facility, the lender could proceed against the collateral granted to it to secure that indebtedness.\nAlmost all of the value of our production and reserves is concentrated in a single block offshore Gabon, and any production problems or reductions in reserve estimates related to this property would adversely impact our business.\nThe Etame Marin block consists of five fields with 12 producing wells. Production from these fields constituted approximately 98% of our total production for the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, at December 31, 2015, 93% of our total net proved reserves were\nattributable to these fields. If mechanical problems, storms or other events curtailed a substantial portion of this production, or if the actual reserves associated with this producing property are less than our estimated reserves, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nIncreases in oil supplies from U.S. shale production, coupled with slower economic growth in economies around the world and a decision by OPEC not to cut production to support higher oil prices, has led to a dramatic reduction in oil prices. While this fall in oil prices may escalate global economic growth rates, thereby increasing demand for oil supplies, the decline in oil prices may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe increase in world oil supplies being produced, due to increased U.S. shale production and OPEC\u2019s decision not to reduce production to support higher oil prices, occurring at the same time as reduced economic activity associated with slower economic growth in China, Europe and other global economies has reduced the demand for, and the prices we receive for, our oil and natural gas production. In addition, the U.S. federal government has recently ended its decades-old prohibition of exports of crude oil produced in the lower 48 states of the U.S. It is too recent an event to determine the impact this regulatory change may have on our operations or our sales of crude oil. A sustained reduction in the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the borrowing base under our credit facility.\nIf oil and natural gas prices remain depressed for extended periods of time, we may be required to take further write-downs in the value of our oil and natural gas properties.\nThe estimated future net revenues attributable to our net proved reserves are prepared in accordance with current SEC guidelines, and are not intended to reflect the fair market value of our reserves. In accordance with the rules of the SEC, our reserve estimates are prepared using the un-weighted average price received for oil and natural gas based on closing prices on the first day of each month for the preceding twelve months from the date of the report. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded an impairment loss of $98.3 million to write down our investment in certain fields comprising the Etame Marin block to fair value as a result of the declines in the forecasted oil prices used in the impairment testing and calculation. As a result of further declines in prices and increased development well costs, during 2015, we recorded additional impairments totaling $81.3 million related to the Etame Marin block and to various fields in the U.S. Sustained lower prices will cause the estimated quantities and present values of our reserves to be reduced, which may necessitate further write-downs.\nUnless we are able to replace reserves which we have produced, our cash flows and production will decrease over time.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our estimated net proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are produced. There can be no assurance that our planned development and exploration projects and acquisition activities will result in significant additional reserves or that we will have continuing success drilling productive wells at economic finding costs. The drilling of oil and natural gas wells involves a high degree of risk, especially the risk of dry holes or of wells that are not sufficiently productive to provide an economic return on the capital expended to drill the wells. In addition, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including material changes in oil or natural gas prices, title problems, weather conditions, political instability, availability of capital, economic/currency imbalances, compliance with governmental requirements, receipt of additional seismic data or the reprocessing of existing data, prolonged periods of historically low oil and natural gas prices, failure of wells drilled in similar formations or delays in the delivery of equipment and availability of drilling rigs. Certain domestic oil and natural gas producing properties, as well as our Equatorial Guinea property are operated by third parties and, as a result, we have limited control over the nature and timing of exploration and development of such properties or the manner in which operations are conducted on such properties.\nSubstantial capital, which may not be available to us in the future, is required to replace and grow reserves.\nTo replace and grow reserves, we must make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition, exploitation, development, exploration and production of oil and natural gas reserves. Historically, we have financed these expenditures primarily with cash flow from operations, debt, asset sales, and private sales of equity. During 2015, we participated in exploration and development projects on our international properties. In Gabon and Angola, we are the operator of the blocks and are thus responsible for contracting on behalf of all the remaining parties participating in the project. We rely on the timely payment of cash calls by our partners to pay for 69.95% of the offshore Gabon budget and 50% of the offshore Angola budget. The continued economic health of our partners could be adversely affected by low oil prices thereby adversely affecting their ability to make timely payment of cash calls. In Angola, our partner, Sonangol P&P failed to pay its cash calls timely, and was in default from the first quarter of 2015 through March 2016.\nHowever, if continuing depressed oil and natural gas prices, operating difficulties or declines in reserves result in our revenues being less than expected or limit our ability to borrow funds, or our partners fail to pay their share of project costs, we may have a limited ability to expend the capital necessary to undertake or complete future drilling programs. We cannot assure you that the financing under our revolving credit facility will be available in the future or that additional debt or equity financing or cash generated by operations will be available to meet these requirements.\nOur drilling activities require us to risk significant amounts of capital that may not be recovered.\nDrilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be encountered. There can be no assurance that new wells drilled by us will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment. Drilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells, but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues to return a profit after drilling, operating and other costs. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain and cost overruns are common. Our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including title problems, weather conditions, equipment failures or accidents, elevated pressure or irregularities in geologic formations, compliance with governmental requirements and shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment and services.\nWe have less control over our foreign investments than domestic investments, and added risk in foreign countries may affect our foreign investments.\nOur international assets and operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties, including, among other things, the risks of war, expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts, taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions, changing political conditions, international monetary fluctuations, currency controls and foreign governmental regulations that favor or require the awarding of drilling contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. For example, the Gabonese government has recently audited the accounts of a number of energy companies, including ours, that has led to disputes. The Gabonese government has formed a new oil company that may seek to participate in oil and natural gas projects in a manner that could be dilutive to the interest of current license holders and the Gabonese government is under pressure from the Gabonese labor union to require companies to hire higher percentage of Gabonese citizens. In addition, if a dispute arises with our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons, especially foreign oil ministries and national oil companies, to the jurisdiction of the U.S.\nPrivate ownership of oil and natural gas reserves under oil and natural gas leases in the U.S. differs distinctly from our rights in foreign reserves where the state generally retains ownership of the minerals, and in many cases participates in, the exploration and production of hydrocarbon reserves. Accordingly, operations outside the U.S. may be materially affected by host governments through royalty payments, export taxes and regulations, surcharges, value added taxes, production bonuses and other charges. Gabon has indicated an interest in taking their oil in kind rather than us continuing to marketing on their behalf, which could cause fluctuations in the timing of and realized prices for oil sales.\nAlmost all of our proved reserves are related to the Etame Marin block located offshore Gabon. We have operated in Gabon since 1995 and believe we have good relations with the current Gabonese government. However, there can be no assurance that present or future administrations or governmental regulations in Gabon will not materially adversely affect our operations or cash flows.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by violent acts such as from civil disturbances, terrorist acts, regime changes, cross-border violence, war, piracy, or other conflicts that may occur in regions that encompass our operations.\nViolent acts resulting in loss of life, destruction of property, environmental damage and pollution occur around the world. Many incidents are driven by civil, ethnic, religious or economic strife. In addition, the number of incidents attributed to various terrorist organizations has increased significantly. We operate in regions of the world that have experienced such incidents or are in close proximity to areas where violence has occurred.\nWe monitor the economic and political environments of the countries in which we operate. However, we are unable to predict the occurrence of disturbances such as those noted above. In addition, we have limited ability to mitigate their impact.\nCivil disturbances, terrorist acts, regime changes, war, or conflicts, or the threats thereof, could have the following results, among others:\n\u00b7\nvolatility in global crude oil prices which could negatively impact the global economy, resulting in slower economic growth rates, which could reduce demand for our products;\n\u00b7\nnegative impact on the world crude oil supply if infrastructure or transportation are disrupted, leading to further commodity price volatility;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to work in areas with potential for conflict;\n\u00b7\ninability of our personnel or supplies to enter or exit the countries where we are conducting operations;\n\u00b7\ndisruption of our operations due to evacuation of personnel;\n\u00b7\ninability to deliver our production due to disruption or closing of transportation routes;\n\u00b7\nreduced ability to export our production due to efforts of countries to conserve domestic resources;\n\u00b7\ndamage to or destruction of our wells, production facilities, receiving terminals or other operating assets;\n\u00b7\ndamage to or destruction of property belonging to our commodity purchasers leading to interruption of deliveries, claims of force majeure, and/or termination of commodity sales contracts, resulting in a reduction in our revenues;\n\u00b7\ninability of our service and equipment providers to deliver items necessary for us to conduct our operations resulting in a halt or delay in our planned exploration activities, delayed development of major projects, or shut-in of producing fields;\n\u00b7\nlack of availability of drilling rig, oilfield equipment or services if third party providers decide to exit the region;\n\u00b7\nshutdown of a financial system, communications network, or power grid causing a disruption to our business activities; and\n\u00b7\ncapital market reassessment of risk and reduction of available capital making it more difficult for us and our partners to obtain financing for potential development projects.\nLoss of property and/or interruption of our business plans resulting from civil unrest could have a significant negative impact on our earnings and cash flow. In addition, we may not have enough insurance to cover any loss of property or other claims resulting from these risks.\nCyber-attacks targeting systems and infrastructure used by the oil and natural gas industry may adversely impact our operations.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, production and financial activities. We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and natural gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, and communicate with our employees and third party partners. Unauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruptions in our exploration or production operations. Also, computers control nearly all of the oil and natural gas distribution systems in the U.S. and abroad, which are necessary to transport our production to market. A cyber-attack directed at oil and natural gas distribution systems could damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment, delay or prevent delivery of production to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions. While we have not experienced significant cyber-attacks, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such attacks and resulting losses in the future. Further, as cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber-attacks.\nWe rely on a single purchaser of our Gabon production, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe currently sell our crude oil production from Gabon under a term contract with Glencore at pricing based upon an average of Dated Brent in the month of lifting, adjusted for location and market factors, that ends in July 2016.\nCompetitive industry conditions may negatively affect our ability to conduct operations.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive. We compete with, and may be outbid by, competitors in our attempts to acquire exploration and production rights in oil and natural gas properties. These properties include exploration prospects as well as properties with proved reserves. There is also competition for contracting for drilling equipment and the hiring of experienced personnel. Factors that affect our ability to compete in the marketplace include:\n\u00b7\nour access to the capital necessary to drill wells and acquire properties;\n\u00b7\nour ability to acquire and analyze seismic, geological and other information relating to a property;\n\u00b7\nour ability to retain and hire the personnel necessary to properly evaluate seismic and other information relating to a property;\n\u00b7\nour ability to retain and hire experienced personnel, especially for our engineering, geoscience and accounting departments; and;\n\u00b7\nthe location of, and our ability to access, platforms, pipelines and other facilities used to produce and transport oil and natural gas production.\nOur competitors include major integrated oil companies and substantial independent energy companies, many of which possess greater financial, technological, personnel and other resources than we do. These companies may be able to pay more for oil and natural gas properties, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties than our financial or human resources permit, and may be better able than we are to continue drilling during periods of low oil and natural gas prices, to contract for drilling equipment and to secure trained personnel. Our competitors may also use superior technology which we may be unable to afford or which would require costly investment by us in order to compete.\nWeather, unexpected subsurface conditions and other unforeseen operating hazards may adversely impact our oil and natural gas activities.\nThe oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating risks, including fire, explosions, blow-outs, pipe failure, casing collapse, abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, ruptures and discharges of toxic gases, underground migration and surface spills or mishandling of fracture fluids including chemical additives, the occurrence of any of which could result in substantial losses to us due to injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution and other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations. Our production facilities are also subject to hazards inherent in marine operations, such as capsizing, sinking, grounding, collision and damage from severe weather conditions. The relatively deep offshore drilling conducted by us overseas involves increased drilling risks of high pressures and mechanical difficulties, including stuck pipe, collapsed casing and separated cable. The impact that any of these risks may have upon us is increased due to the low number of producing properties we own.\nWe maintain insurance against some, but not all, potential risks; however, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover any losses or exposure for liability. The occurrence of a significant unfavorable event not fully covered by insurance could have\na material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, we cannot predict whether insurance will continue to be available at a reasonable cost or at all.\nSignificant physical effects of climate change have the potential to damage our facilities, disrupt our production activities and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nIn interpretive guidance on climate change disclosure, the SEC indicates that climate change could have an effect on the severity of weather (including hurricanes and floods), sea levels, the arability of farmland, and water availability and quality. If such effects were to occur, our exploration and production operations have the potential to be adversely affected. Potential adverse effects could include damages to our facilities from powerful winds or rising waters in low-lying areas, disruption of our production activities because of climate-related damages to our facilities and our costs of operation potentially arising from such climatic effects, less efficient or non-routine operating practices necessitated by climate effects or increased costs for insurance coverages in the aftermath of such effects. Significant physical effects of climate change could also have an indirect effect on our financing and operations by disrupting the transportation or process-related services provided by midstream companies, service companies or suppliers with whom we have a business relationship. We may not be able to recover through insurance some or any of the damages, losses or costs that may result from potential physical effects of climate change. If drought conditions were to occur, our ability to obtain water could be impacted and in turn, our ability to perform hydraulic fracturing operations could be restricted or made more costly.\nWe may not have enough insurance to cover all of the risks we face and operators of prospects in which we participate may not maintain or may fail to obtain adequate insurance.\nOur business is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration for and production, gathering, processing, and transportation of oil and natural gas, including blowouts, cratering and fire, any of which could result in damage to, or destruction of, oil and natural gas wells or formations, production facilities, and other property, as well as injury to persons. For protection against financial loss resulting from these operating hazards, we maintain insurance coverage, including insurance coverage for certain physical damage, blowout/control of a well, comprehensive general liability, and worker\u2019s compensation and employer\u2019s liability. However, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover us against 100% of potential losses arising as a result of the foregoing, and for certain risks, such as political risk, nationalization, business interruption, war, terrorism, and piracy, for which we have limited or no coverage. In addition, we are not insured against all risks in all aspects of our business, such as hurricanes. The occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur reserve information represents estimates that may turn out to be incorrect if the assumptions upon which these estimates are based are inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present values of our reserves.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves, including many factors beyond our control. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating the underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The estimates included in this document are based on various assumptions required by the SEC, including unescalated prices and costs and capital expenditures subsequent to December 31, 2015, and, therefore, are inherently imprecise indications of future net revenues. Actual future production, revenues, taxes, operating expenses, development expenditures and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. Any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves.\nIn addition, our reserves may be subject to downward or upward revision based upon production history, results of future development, availability of funds to acquire additional reserves, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors. Moreover, the calculation of the estimated present value of the future net revenue using a 10% discount rate as required by the SEC is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with our reserves or the oil and natural gas industry in general. It is also possible that reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and future net revenues based on the same available data.\nThe estimated future net revenues attributable to our net proved reserves are prepared in accordance with current SEC guidelines, and are not intended to reflect the fair market value of our reserves. In accordance with the rules of the SEC, our reserve estimates are prepared using an average of beginning of month prices received for oil and natural gas for the preceding twelve months. Future reductions in prices below the average calculated for 2015 would result in the estimated quantities and present values of our reserves being reduced.\nA substantial portion of our proved reserves are or will be subject to service contracts, production sharing contracts and other arrangements. The quantity of oil and natural gas that we will ultimately receive under these arrangements will differ based on numerous factors, including the price of oil and natural gas, production rates, production costs, cost recovery provisions and local tax and royalty regimes. Changes in many of these factors do not affect estimates of U.S reserves in the same way they affect estimates of proved reserves in foreign jurisdictions, or will have a different effect on reserves in foreign countries than in the U.S. As a result, proved reserves in foreign jurisdictions may not be comparable to proved reserve estimates in the U.S.\nOur results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and compliance with debt covenants could be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency risk from our foreign operations. While oil sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, portions of our costs in Gabon and Angola are denominated in the local currency. A weakening U.S. dollar will have the effect of increasing costs while a strengthening U.S. dollar will have the effect of reducing operating costs. The Gabon local currency is tied to the Euro. The exchange rate between the Euro and the U.S. dollar has fluctuated widely in recent years in response to international political conditions, general economic conditions, the European sovereign debt crisis and other factors beyond our control. Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and compliance with debt covenants could be adversely affected by such fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates may negatively impact our earnings, which are subject to financial covenants under our revolving credit facility. Failure to maintain these covenants could preclude us from borrowing under our revolving credit facility and require us to immediately pay down any outstanding drawn amounts under the credit agreement, which could affect cash flows or restrict business. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit facility.\nWe may be unable to integrate successfully the operations of any acquisitions with our operations, and we may not realize all the anticipated benefits of any future acquisitions.\nFailure to successfully assimilate any acquisitions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, unexpected costs and challenges may arise whenever businesses with different operations or management are combined, and we may experience unanticipated delays in realizing the benefits of an acquisition. If we consummate any future acquisition, our capitalization and results of operation may change significantly, and you may not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in evaluating future acquisitions.\nProperties that we buy may not produce as projected, and we may be unable to determine reserve potential, identify liabilities associated with the properties or obtain protection from sellers against such liabilities, which could result in material liabilities and adversely affect our financial condition.\nOne of our growth strategies is to capitalize on opportunistic acquisitions of oil and natural gas reserves. Any future acquisition will require an assessment of recoverable reserves, title, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, potential environmental hazards, potential tax and employer liabilities, and other liabilities and similar factors. Ordinarily, our review efforts are focused on the higher valued properties and are inherently incomplete because it generally is not feasible to review in depth every potential liability on each individual property involved in each acquisition. Even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and potential problems, such as ground water contamination and other environmental conditions and deficiencies in the mechanical integrity of equipment are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Any unidentified problems could result in material liabilities and costs that negatively impact our financial condition.\nAdditional potential risks related to acquisitions include, among other things:\n\u00b7\nincorrect assumptions regarding the future prices of oil and natural gas or the future operating or development costs of properties acquired;\n\u00b7\nthe risk that oil and natural gas reserves acquired may not be of the anticipated magnitude or may not be developed as anticipated;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in the assimilation of the assets and operations of the acquired business, especially if the assets acquired are in a new business segment or geographic area;\n\u00b7\nthe assumption of liabilities;\n\u00b7\nlimitations on rights to indemnity from the seller;\n\u00b7\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u00b7\nlosses of key employees at the acquired businesses;\n\u00b7\noperating a significantly larger combined organization and adding operations;\n\u00b7\nthe failure to realize expected profitability or growth;\n\u00b7\nthe failure to realize expected synergies and cost savings; and\n\u00b7\ncoordinating or consolidating corporate and administrative functions.\nIf we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly.\nCompliance with environmental and other government regulations could be costly and could negatively impact production.\nThe laws and regulations of the U.S., Gabon, Angola and Equatorial Guinea regulate our current business. These laws and regulations may require that we obtain permits for our development, limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain protected or sensitive areas, or restrict the substances that can be released in connection with our operations. Our operations could result in liability for personal injuries, property damage, natural resource damages, oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean-up costs and other\nenvironmental damages. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties and the issuance of orders enjoining operations. In addition, we could be liable for environmental damages caused by, among others, previous property owners or operators of properties that we purchase or lease. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liabilities for remediation of releases of hazardous substances, rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person. As a result, we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities and may be required to incur substantial remediation costs. We could also be affected by more stringent laws and regulations adopted in the future, including any related to climate change and greenhouse gases and use of hydraulic fracturing fluids, resulting in increased operating costs. As a result, substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred, the payment of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Additionally, more stringent GHG regulation could impact demand for oil and natural gas.\nThese laws and governmental regulations, which cover matters including drilling operations, taxation and environmental protection, may be changed from time to time in response to economic or political conditions and could have a significant impact on our operating costs, as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general. While we believe that we are currently in compliance with environmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations, no assurances can be given that we will be able to continue to comply with such environmental laws and regulations without incurring substantial costs.\nIf our assumptions underlying accruals for abandonment costs are too low, we could be required to expend greater amounts than expected.\nAlmost all of our producing properties are located offshore. The costs to abandon offshore wells may be substantial. For financial accounting purposes, we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and capitalize the related costs as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived assets. The estimated liability is reflected as Asset retirement obligation in the balance sheets.\nAs part of the Etame field production license, we are subject to a cash funding arrangement for the eventual abandonment of all offshore wells, platforms and facilities on the Etame Marin block. On an annual basis over the remaining life of the production license, we fund a portion of these estimated abandonment costs. The amount of cash funded through the end of a period is reflected separately from the asset retirement obligation under other long term assets as Abandonment funding and is non-refundable to us. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Segment and Geographic Information -Gabon Segment-Etame Marin Block-Abandonment\u201d for further information. If estimated abandonment costs were to increase in the future, we may be required to increase our funding of such costs.\nFrom time to time we may hedge a portion of our production, which may result in our making cash payments or prevent us from receiving the full benefit of increases in prices for oil and natural gas.\nWe may reduce our exposure to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices by hedging a portion of our production. Hedging also prevents us from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil or natural gas prices above the maximum fixed amount specified in the hedge agreement. In a typical hedge transaction, we have the right to receive from the hedge counterparty the excess of the maximum fixed price specified in the hedge agreement over a floating price based on a market index, multiplied by the quantity hedged. If the floating price exceeds the maximum fixed price, we must pay the counterparty this difference multiplied by the quantity hedged even if we had insufficient production to cover the quantities specified in the hedge agreement. Accordingly, if we have less production than we have hedged when the floating price exceeds the fixed price, we must make payments against which there are no offsetting sales of production. If these payments become too large, the remainder of our business may be adversely affected.\nThe distressed financial conditions of one or more hedge providers could have an adverse impact on us in the event these hedge providers are unable to pay us amounts owed to us under one or more financial hedge transactions by which we have hedged our exposure to commodity price volatility.\nFrom time to time, we may enter into financial hedge transactions to hedge or mitigate our exposure to the risks of commodity price volatility with respect to the crude oil or natural gas we produce and sell. Similarly, some credit agreement facilities will require that we enter into financial hedges with creditworthy hedge providers for a percentage of our anticipated oil and natural gas production in order to ensure that we are able to make debt service payments under such credit facilities if oil and natural gas prices fall. In such instances, the hedge provider will be obligated to make payments to us under such financial hedge transactions to the extent that the floating (market) price is below an agreed fixed (strike) price. Hedging agreements expose us to risk of financial loss if the counterparty to a hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations. This risk of counterparty performance is of particular concern given the disruptions that have occurred in the financial markets that led to sudden changes in counterparty\u2019s liquidity and hence their ability to perform under their hedging contracts with us. We are unable to predict sudden changes in counterparty\u2019s creditworthiness or ability to perform. Even if we do accurately predict sudden changes, our ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions. If the creditworthiness of our counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance, we could incur a significant loss.\nThe adoption of derivatives legislation by the U.S. Congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use financial derivative instruments to reduce (hedge, manage or mitigate) the effect of commodity price, interest rate, and other cost volatilities associated with its business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), signed into law in 2010, establishes, among other provisions, federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives markets and entities, such as us, that participate in\nthose markets. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation; although the CFTC and the SEC have issued final regulations in certain areas, final rules in other areas and the scope of relevant definitions and/or exemptions still remain to be finalized. In one of its rulemaking proceedings still pending under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC issued on November 5, 2013, a proposed rule imposing position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Certain specified types of hedging transactions are exempt from these position limits, provided that such hedging transactions satisfy the CFTC\u2019s requirements for \u201cbona fide hedging\u201d transactions or positions. Similarly, the CFTC has issued a proposed rule regarding the capital that a swap dealer or major swap participant is required to post with respect to its swap business, but the CTFC has not yet issued a final rule. The CFTC issued a final rule on Margin requirements for uncleared swap transactions on January 6, 2016, which includes an exemption for commercial end-users entering into uncleared swaps in order to hedge commercial risks affecting their business from any requirement to post margin to secure their swap transactions that are hedging commercial risks. In addition, the CFTC has issued a final rule authorizing an exception for commercial end-users using swaps to hedge their commercial risks from the otherwise applicable mandatory obligation under the Dodd-Frank Act to clear all swap transactions through a derivatives clearing organization and to trade all such swaps on an exchange. The Dodd-Frank Act also imposes recordkeeping and reporting obligations on counterparties to swap transactions and other regulatory compliance obligations. All of the above regulations could increase the costs to us of entering into financial derivative transactions to hedge or mitigate our exposure to commodity price volatility and other commercial risks affecting our business.\nWhile it is not possible at this time to predict when the CFTC will issue final rules applicable to position limits or capital requirements, depending on our ability to satisfy the CFTC\u2019s requirements for a commercial end-user using swaps to hedge or mitigate our commercial risks, these rules and regulations may require us to comply with position limits and with certain clearing and trade-execution requirements in connection with our financial derivative activities. The Dodd-Frank Act may also require our current counterparties to financial derivative transactions to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties, and may cause some entities to cease their current business as hedge providers. These changes could reduce the liquidity of the financial derivatives markets thereby reducing the ability of commercial end-users to have access to financial derivatives to hedge or mitigate their exposure to commodity price volatility. The Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts (including through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available capital for other commercial operations purposes), materially alter the terms of future swaps relative to the terms of our existing bilaterally negotiated financial derivative contracts, and reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against commercial risks we encounter.\nFinally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks and on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nCertain U.S. federal income tax preferences currently available with respect to oil and natural gas production may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nIn recent years, the U.S. government\u2019s budget proposals and other proposed legislation have included the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production. If enacted into law, these proposals would eliminate certain tax preferences applicable to taxpayers engaged in the exploration or production of natural resources. These changes include, but are not limited to (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the deduction for U.S. production activities and (iv) the increase in the amortization period from two years to seven years for geophysical costs paid or incurred in connection with the exploration for or development of, oil and natural gas within the U.S. It is unclear whether any such changes will be enacted or how soon any such changes would become effective. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have received an audit report related to our Etame Marin block operations from the Gabon Taxation Department, and an adverse result of the audit could result in a material liability and adversely affect our financial condition.\nIn October 2014, we received a provisional audit report related to our Etame Marine block operations from the Gabon Taxation Department as part of a special industry-wide audit of business practices and financial transactions in Gabon. In November 2014, we responded to the Gabon Taxation Department requesting joint meetings to advance the resolution of this matter and later provided a formal reply to the provisional audit report in February 2015. A tentative agreement was reached with the Gabon Taxation Department in April 2015, and we are working with the Gabon Taxation Department to finalize the audit. During 2015, we accrued an estimated settlement of $0.3 million based upon preliminary negotiations. The ultimate outcome of the claim and impact cannot be predicted, and an adverse result of the audit could result in a material liability and adversely affect our financial condition.\nThere are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud that could seriously harm our business may occur and not be detected.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control\nsystem must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, an evaluation of controls can only provide reasonable assurance that all material control issues and instances of fraud, if any, in our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Further, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or by collusion of two or more persons. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. A failure of our controls and procedures to detect error or fraud could seriously harm our business and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 78841, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "EGY"}
