{"cik": "1595262", "company": "IMS Health Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe rely on third parties to provide certain data. Our data suppliers might restrict our use of or refuse to license data, which could lead to our inability to provide certain services and, as a result, materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nEach of our information services is derived from data we collect from third parties. These data suppliers are numerous and diverse, reflecting the broad scope of information that we collect and use in our business.\nAlthough we typically enter into long-term contractual arrangements with many of these suppliers of data, at the time of entry into a new contract or renewal of an existing contract, suppliers may increase restrictions on our use of such data, increase the price they charge us for data or refuse altogether to license the data to us. In addition, during the term of any data supply contract, suppliers may fail to adhere to our data quality control standards or fail to deliver data. Further, although no single individual data supplier is material to our business, if a number of suppliers collectively representing a significant amount of data that we use for one or more of our services were to impose additional contractual restrictions on our use of or access to data, fail to adhere to our quality-control standards, repeatedly fail to deliver data or refuse to provide data, now or in the future, our ability to provide those services to our clients could be materially adversely impacted, which may harm our operating results and financial condition.\nFailure to meet productivity objectives under our internal business transformation initiatives could adversely impact our competitiveness and harm our operating results.\nWe are pursuing business transformation initiatives to update technology, increase innovation and obtain operating efficiencies. As part of these initiatives, we seek to improve our productivity, flexibility, quality, functionality and cost savings by investing in the development and implementation of global platforms and integration of our business processes and functions to achieve economies of scale. For example, we hired and trained more than 500 people to form a COE in Manila, The Philippines for standardizing and cleaning data received from data suppliers, developed updated tools for standardizing and cleaning data, are moving local standardizing and cleaning from countries around the world to the Manila COE, and retired local standardizing and cleaning systems. These various initiatives may not yield their intended gains, which may impact our competitiveness and our ability to meet our growth objectives and, as a result, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nIf we are unsuccessful at investing in growth opportunities, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe continue to invest significantly in growth opportunities, including the development and acquisition of new data, technologies and services to meet our clients\u2019 needs. For example, we are expanding our services and technology offerings, such as the development of a cloud-based platform with a growing number of applications to support commercial operations for life sciences companies (e.g., multi-channel marketing, marketing campaign management, CRM, incentive compensation management, targeting and segmentation, performance management and other applications). We also continue to invest significantly in growth opportunities in emerging markets, such as the development, launch and enhancement of services in China, India, Russia, Turkey and other countries. We believe healthcare spending in these emerging markets will continue to grow over the next five years, and we consider our presence in these markets to be an important focus of our growth strategy.\nThere is no assurance that our investment plans or growth strategy will be successful or will produce a sufficient or any return on our investments. Further, if we are unable to develop new technologies and services, clients do not purchase our new technologies and services, our new technologies and services do not work as intended or there are delays in the availability or adoption of our new technologies and services, then we may not be able to grow our business or growth may occur slower than anticipated. Additionally, although we expect continued growth in healthcare spending in emerging markets, such spending may occur more slowly or not at all, and we may not benefit from our investments in these markets.\nWe plan to fund growth opportunities with cash from operations or from future financings. There can be no assurance that those sources will be available in sufficient amounts to fund future growth opportunities when needed.\nAny of the foregoing could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nData protection, privacy and similar laws restrict access, use and disclosure of information, and failure to comply with or adapt to changes in these laws could materially and adversely harm our business.\nPatient health information is among the most sensitive of personal information and it is critical that information about an individual\u2019s healthcare is properly protected from inappropriate access, use and disclosure. Laws restricting access, use and disclosure of such information include the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), the European Union\u2019s Data Protection Directive, Canada\u2019s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act and other data protection, privacy and similar national, state/provincial and local laws. We have established frameworks, models, processes and technologies to manage privacy for many data types, from a variety of sources, and under myriad privacy and data protection laws worldwide. In addition, we rely on our data suppliers to deliver information to us in a form and in a manner that complies with applicable privacy and data protection laws. These laws are complex and there is no assurance that the safeguards and controls employed by us or our data suppliers will be sufficient to prevent a breach of these laws, or that claims will not be filed against us or our data suppliers despite such safeguards and controls. For example, in February 2014, a group of individuals filed a civil lawsuit in Korea against IMS Health Korea Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary (\u201cIMS Korea\u201d), the Korean Pharmaceutical Association (\u201cKPA\u201d) and a KPA affiliate that supplies data to IMS Korea. The lawsuit alleges the KPA affiliate collected plaintiffs\u2019 personal information without the necessary consent in violation of applicable privacy laws and transferred such information to IMS Korea for sale to customers. See \u201cLegal\nProceedings.\u201d Alleged or actual failure to comply with such laws may result in, among other things, negative publicity, damage to our reputation, civil and criminal liability, data being blocked from use or liability under contractual provisions.\nLaws and expectations relating to privacy continue to evolve, and we continue to adapt to changing needs. Nevertheless, changes in these laws (including newly released interpretations of these laws by courts and regulatory bodies) may limit our data access, use and disclosure, and may require increased expenditures by us or may dictate that we not offer certain types of services. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse impact on our ability to provide services to our clients or maintain our profitability.\nThere is ongoing concern from privacy advocates, regulators and others regarding data protection and privacy issues, and the number of jurisdictions with data protection and privacy laws has been increasing. Also, there are ongoing public policy discussions regarding whether the standards for de-identified, anonymous or pseudonomized health information are sufficient, and the risk of re-identification sufficiently small, to adequately protect patient privacy. These discussions may lead to further restrictions on the use of such information. There can be no assurance that these initiatives or future initiatives will not adversely affect our ability to access and use data or to develop or market current or future services.\nData protection, privacy and similar laws protect more than patient information, and although they vary by jurisdiction, these laws can extend to employee information, business contact information, provider information and other information relating to identifiable individuals. Failure to comply with these laws may result in, among other things, civil and criminal liability, negative publicity, damage to our reputation and liability under contractual provisions. In addition, compliance with such laws may require increased costs to us or may dictate that we not offer certain types of services.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing could impact our ability to provide the same level of service to our clients, force us to modify our offerings or increase our costs, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nSecurity breaches and unauthorized use of our IT systems and information, or the IT systems or information in the possession of our vendors, could expose us, our clients, our data suppliers or others to risk of loss.\nWe rely upon the security of our computer and communications systems infrastructure to protect us from cyber attacks and unauthorized access. Cyber attacks can include malware, computer viruses, hacking or other significant disruption of our computer, communications and related systems. Although we take steps to manage and avoid these risks and to prevent their recurrence, our preventive and remedial actions may not be successful. Such attacks, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in our incurring costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages or fines, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties. Publicity about vulnerabilities and attempted or successful incursions could damage our reputation with clients and data suppliers and reduce demand for our services.\nWe also store proprietary and sensitive information in connection with our business, which could be compromised by a cyber attack. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, an inappropriate disclosure of proprietary or sensitive information, an inability to access data sources, or an inability to process data or provide our offerings to our clients, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our data suppliers and clients (including loss of suppliers and clients), lead to claims against us and ultimately harm our business. We may be required to incur significant costs to alleviate, remedy or protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future. We may also face inquiry or increased scrutiny from government agencies as a result of any such disruption or breach. While we have insurance coverage for certain instances of a cyber security breach, our coverage may not be sufficient if we suffer a significant attack or multiple attacks. Any such breach or disruption could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and our reputation as a provider of mission-critical services.\nSome of our vendors have significant responsibility for the security of certain of our data centers and computer-based platforms. Also, our data suppliers have responsibility for security of their own computer and communications environments. These third parties face risks relating to cyber security similar to ours, which could disrupt their businesses and therefore materially impact ours. Accordingly, we are subject to any flaw in or breaches to their computer and communications systems or those that they operate for us, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial results.\nHardware and software failures, delays in the operation of our computer and communications systems or the failure to implement system enhancements may adversely impact us.\nOur success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems. A failure of our network or data-gathering procedures could impede the processing of data, delivery of databases and services, client orders and day-to-day management of our business and could result in the corruption or loss of data.\nWhile many of our operations have disaster recovery plans in place, we currently do not have excess or standby computer processing or network capacity everywhere in the world to avoid disruption in the receipt, processing and delivery of data in the event\nof a system failure. Despite any precautions we may take, damage from fire, floods, hurricanes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins, sabotage, breaches of security, epidemics and similar events at our various computer facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to our servers and from our servers to our clients. In addition, any failure by our computer environment to provide sufficient processing or network capacity to transfer data could result in interruptions in our service. In the event of a delay in the delivery of data, we could be required to transfer our data collection operations to an alternative provider of server hosting services. Such a transfer could result in significant delays in our ability to deliver services to our clients, and increase our costs. Additionally, significant delays in the planned delivery of system enhancements, improvements and inadequate performance of the systems once they are completed could damage our reputation and harm our business. Finally, long-term disruptions in the infrastructure caused by events such as natural disasters, the outbreak of war, the escalation of hostilities, epidemics and acts of terrorism (particularly involving cities in which we have offices) could result in a material adverse effect.\nAlthough we carry property and business interruption insurance, our coverage may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur. Any such failure, disruption or delay could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and our reputation.\nConsolidation in the industries in which our clients operate may reduce the volume of services purchased by consolidated clients following an acquisition or merger, which could harm our operating results and financial condition.\nMergers or consolidations among our clients have in the past and could in the future reduce the number of our clients and potential clients. When companies consolidate, overlapping services previously purchased separately are usually purchased only once by the combined entity, leading to loss of revenue. Other services that were previously purchased by one of the merged or consolidated entities may be deemed unnecessary or cancelled. If our clients merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services. There can be no assurance as to the degree to which we may be able to address the revenue impact of such consolidation. Any of these developments could harm our operating results and financial condition.\nLaws restricting pharmaceutical sales and marketing practices may adversely impact demand for our services.\nThere have been a significant number of laws, legislative initiatives and regulatory actions over the years that seek to limit pharmaceutical sales and marketing practices. For example, three states in 2006 and 2007 passed laws restricting the use of prescriber identifiable information for the purpose of promoting branded prescription medicines. Although these laws were subsequently declared to be unconstitutional based on a decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in Sorrell v. IMS Health in 2011, we are unable to predict whether, and in what form, other initiatives may be introduced or actions taken at the state or Federal levels to limit pharmaceutical sales and marketing practices. In addition, while we will continue to seek to adapt our services to comply with the requirements of these laws (to the extent applicable to our services), if enacted, there can be no assurance that our efforts to adapt our offerings will be successful and provide the same financial contribution to us. There can also be no assurance that future legislative initiatives will not adversely affect our ability to develop or market current or future offerings, or that any future laws will not diminish the demand for our services, all of which could, over time, result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to increasing competition.\nOur future growth and success will depend on our ability to successfully compete with other companies that provide similar services in the same markets, some of which may have financial, marketing, technical and other advantages. We also expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of consolidation in both the information technology and healthcare industries. If one or more of our competitors or potential competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. We compete on the basis of various factors, including breadth and depth of services, reputation, reliability, quality, innovation, security, price and industry expertise and experience. In addition, our ability to compete successfully may be impacted by the growing availability of health information from social media, government health information systems and other free or low-cost sources. For example, the United Kingdom\u2019s National Health Service started releasing large volumes of data beginning in December 2011 at little or no charge, reducing the demand for our information services derived from similar data. In addition, consolidation or integration of wholesalers, retail pharmacies, health networks, payers or other healthcare stakeholders may lead any of them to provide information services directly to clients or indirectly through a designated service provider, resulting in increased competition from firms that may have lower costs to market (e.g., no data supply costs). Any of the above may result in lower demand for our services, which could result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nTax matters could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe operate in more than 100 countries worldwide and our earnings are subject to taxation in many differing jurisdictions and at differing rates. We seek to organize our affairs in a tax-efficient manner, taking account of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our\nprovision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could harm our financial results in future periods. In addition, we are subject to continuous examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and tax liability.\nLitigation or regulatory proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIn the normal course of our business, we are involved in lawsuits, claims, audits and investigations, such as those described in \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d The outcome of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. In addition, we may become subject to future lawsuits, claims, audits and investigations that could result in substantial costs and divert our attention and resources. Litigation is inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages, or an injunction stopping us from producing, publishing or selling services, engaging in business practices or requiring other remedies such as divestitures.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by factors affecting the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries.\nThe vast majority of our revenue is generated from sales to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries. The clients we serve in these industries are commonly subject to financial pressures, including, but not limited to, increased costs, reduced demand for their products, reductions in pricing and reimbursement for products and services, formulary approval and placement, government approval to market their products and limits on the manner by which they market their products, loss of patent exclusivity (whether due to patent expiration or as a result of a successful legal challenge) and the proliferation of or changes to regulations applicable to these industries. To the extent our clients face such pressures, the demand for our services, or the prices our clients are willing to pay for those services, may decline. Any such decline could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights.\nOur ability to obtain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation or third-party opposition risks, as well as the uncertainty as to the scope of protection, registrability, patentability, validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights in each applicable country. Governments may adopt regulations, and government agencies or courts may render decisions, requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property rights. When we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights we may be subject to claims that the intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property rights. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, could delay further sales or the implementation of our solutions, impair the functionality of our solutions, delay introductions of new solutions, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our solutions, or injure our reputation and harm our operating results and financial condition.\nThe theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could reduce the differentiation of our services and harm our business; the value of our investment in development or business acquisitions could be reduced; and third parties might make claims against us related to losses of their confidential or proprietary information. These incidents and claims could harm our business, reduce revenue, increase expenses and harm our reputation.\nWe may be subject to claims by others that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights, which could harm our business and negatively impact our results of operations.\nThird parties may assert claims that we or our clients infringe their intellectual property rights and these claims, with or without merit, could be expensive to litigate, cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management resources and attention in defending the claim. In some jurisdictions, plaintiffs can also seek injunctive relief that may limit the operation of our business or prevent the marketing and selling of our products or services that infringe on the plaintiff\u2019s intellectual property rights. To resolve these claims, we may enter into licensing agreements with restrictive terms or significant fees, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy contractual obligations to others. If we do not resolve these claims in advance of a trial, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in court. These outcomes may have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, certain contracts with our suppliers or clients contain provisions whereby we indemnify, subject to certain limitations, the counterparty for damages suffered as a result of claims related to intellectual property infringement and the use of our data. Claims made under these provisions could be expensive to litigate and could result in significant payments.\nWe rely on licenses from third parties to certain technology and intellectual property rights for some of our products and the licenses we currently have could terminate or expire.\nSome of our products or services rely on technology or intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others. Our licenses to this technology or these intellectual property rights could be terminated or could expire. We may be unable to replace these licenses in a timely manner. Failure to renew these licenses, or renewals of these licenses on less advantageous terms, could harm our operating results and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to attract, retain and motivate talented personnel.\nOur business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry and in the locations in which we operate is very competitive. If we are not successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we are unable to retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.\nWe regularly seek to grow our business through acquisitions of or investments in new or complementary businesses, services or technologies, or through strategic alliances, and the failure to manage such acquisitions, investments or alliances could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn executing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements for possible investments, acquisitions and other transactions such as strategic alliances, and we actively pursue these types of transactions in the regular course of business. Pursuing growth by way of these types of transactions involves significant challenges and risks, including the inability to successfully identify acquisition candidates on terms acceptable to us, advance our business strategy, realize a satisfactory return on investment, successfully integrate business activities or resources, or retain key personnel. If we are unable to manage acquisitions or investments, or integrate any acquired businesses, services or technologies effectively, we may not realize the expected benefits from the transaction relative to the consideration paid, and our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nFurther, we may be unsuccessful in identifying and evaluating business, legal or financial risks as part of the due diligence process associated with a particular transaction. In addition, some investments may result in the incurrence of debt or may have contingent consideration components that may require us to pay additional amounts in the future in relation to future performance results of the subject business. If we do enter into agreements with respect to these transactions, we may fail to complete them due to factors such as failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals. We may be unable to realize the full benefits from these transactions, such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, within the timeframes that we expect or at all. These events could divert attention from our other businesses and harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may experience challenges with the acquisition, development, enhancement or deployment of technology necessary for our business.\nWe operate in businesses that require sophisticated computer systems and software for data collection, data processing, cloud-based platforms, analytics, cryptography, statistical projections and forecasting, mobile computing, social media analytics and other applications and technologies. We seek to address our technology risks by increasing our reliance on the use of innovations by cross-industry technology leaders and adapt these for our pharmaceutical and healthcare industry clients. Some of these technologies supporting the industries we serve are changing rapidly and we must continue to adapt to these changes in a timely and effective manner at an acceptable cost. We also must continue to deliver data to our clients in forms that are easy to use while simultaneously providing clear answers to complex questions. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to develop, acquire or integrate new technologies, that these new technologies will meet our clients\u2019 needs or achieve expected investment goals, or that we will be able to do so as quickly or cost-effectively as our competitors. Significant technological change could render our services obsolete. Moreover, the introduction of new services embodying new technologies could render existing services obsolete. Our continued success will depend on our ability to adapt to changing technologies, manage and process ever-increasing amounts of data and information and improve the performance, features and reliability of our services in response to changing client and industry demands. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful design, development, testing, introduction or marketing of our services. New services, or enhancements to existing services, may not adequately meet the requirements of current and prospective clients or achieve any degree of significant market acceptance. Any of these failures could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to international economic, political and other risks that could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have business activities in over 100 countries, and for the year ended December 31, 2014, we generated 63% of our $2.64 billion of revenue from outside the United States. Further, some of our business activities are concentrated into global or regional hubs in one or more geographic areas. For example, to support our businesses in many other countries, we handle standardizing and cleaning of data in Manila, The Philippines, advanced statistics in Beijing, China, analytical support for delivery in Bangalore, India, and reference data management in Santiago, Chile. We are therefore subject to heightened risks inherent in conducting business internationally, in particular in the emerging markets in which we conduct and into which we are expanding our business. These risks include, for example:\n\u00b7\nrequired compliance with a variety of local laws and regulations which may be materially different than those to which we are subject in the United States or which may change unexpectedly;\n\u00b7\nlocal, economic, political and social conditions, including potential hyperinflationary conditions, political instability, and potential nationalization, repatriation, expropriation, price controls or other restrictive government actions;\n\u00b7\nhiring, retaining and overseeing qualified management personnel for managing operations in multiple countries;\n\u00b7\ndiffering employment practices and labor issues;\n\u00b7\ntax-related risks, including the imposition of taxes and the lack of beneficial treaties, that result in a higher effective tax rate for us;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in enforcing agreements through certain foreign local systems;\n\u00b7\nlimitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings;\n\u00b7\npossible liabilities under applicable anti-corruption laws, export controls, anti-boycott and economic sanctions laws;\n\u00b7\nlonger sales and payment cycles;\n\u00b7\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; and\n\u00b7\nsecurity concerns, including crime, political instability and international response thereto.\nTo the extent we are unable to effectively manage our international operations and these risks, our data acquisition activities and sales for certain countries may be adversely affected, we may be subject to additional and unanticipated costs, and we may be subject to litigation or regulatory action. As a consequence, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed.\nFurther, we have substantial assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, we are subject to currency translation exposure on the profits and financial position of our operations, in addition to economic exposure, as a result of devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into dollars.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under applicable anti-corruption laws and any determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments their officials and others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have business in countries and regions which are less developed and are generally recognized as potentially more corrupt business environments. Our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that could be in violation of various anti-corruption laws including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws. We have implemented safeguards and policies to discourage these practices by our employees and agents. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective and our employees or agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. In addition, our significant recent growth globally over the last few years and our anticipated future growth, both organically and through acquisitions, may exacerbate these risks and strain our ability to effectively manage the increased breadth and scope of our activities to avoid these risks. If employees violate our policies or we fail to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions, we may be subject to regulatory sanctions. Violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties, including disgorgement of profits, injunctions and debarment from government contracts, and we may be subject to other liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCatastrophic events or geo-political conditions may disrupt our business.\nA disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, collecting data or performing other mission-critical functions in affected areas. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. Our move toward providing our clients with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans, and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages on our operating results. Abrupt political change, terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs or reduce our revenue.\nWe face risks related to sales to government entities.\nWe derive a portion of our revenue from sales to government entities in the United States, which represented less than 1% of our revenues in each of the last three fiscal years. In general, our contracts with U.S. government entities are terminable at will by the government entity at any time. Government demand and payment for our services may be affected by public-sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations. Government contracts are subject to oversight, including special rules on accounting, expenses, reviews and security. Failure to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, fines and suspensions, or debarment from future business with the U.S. government. As a result, failure to comply with these rules could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur use of accounting estimates involves judgment and could adversely impact our financial results, and ineffective internal controls could adversely impact our business and operating results.\nThe methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations. For more information, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. These methods, estimates and judgments are subject to significant risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and changes could affect our results of operations. In addition, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of the inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nOur Sponsors have significant influence over us, including control over decisions that require the approval of stockholders, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to stockholders for a vote.\nWe are currently controlled by the Sponsors. As of February 6, 2015, investment funds affiliated with the Sponsors beneficially owned approximately 75% of our outstanding common stock. As long as the Sponsors own or control at least a majority of our outstanding voting power, they will have the ability to exercise substantial control over all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, irrespective of how our other stockholders may vote, including the election and removal of directors and the size of our board of directors, any amendment of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or the approval of any merger or other significant corporate transaction, including a sale of substantially all of our assets. Even if their ownership falls below 50%, the Sponsors will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions.\nAdditionally, the Sponsors interests may not align with the interests of our other stockholders. The Sponsors are in the business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. The Sponsors may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce any interest or expectancy in the business opportunities of the Sponsors and of their officers, directors, agents, stockholders, members, partners, affiliates and subsidiaries and each such party shall not have any obligation to offer us those opportunities unless presented to one of our directors or officers in his or her capacity as a director or officer.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE and, as a result, qualify for and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements; you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nBecause the Sponsors control a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of the NYSE. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that, within one year of the date of the listing of our common stock:\n\u00b7\nwe have a board of directors that is composed of a majority of \u201cindependent directors,\u201d as defined under the rules of the NYSE;\n\u00b7\nwe have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors; and\n\u00b7\nwe have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors.\nWe currently avail ourselves of all of these exemptions. Accordingly, in the event the interests of our Sponsors differ from those of other stockholders, and, for so long as we are a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE. Our status as a controlled company could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nProvisions of our corporate governance documents could make an acquisition of our company more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, even if beneficial to our stockholders.\nIn addition to the Sponsors\u2019 beneficial ownership of a controlling percentage of our common stock, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d) contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions, some of which (as noted below) only become effective when the Sponsors no longer beneficially own a majority of our common stock (the \u201cTrigger Date\u201d), include:\n\u00b7\nthe division of our board of directors into three classes and the election of each class for three-year terms;\n\u00b7\nthe sole ability of the board of directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors;\n\u00b7\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations;\n\u00b7\nafter the Trigger Date, limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings and to take action by written consent;\n\u00b7\nafter the Trigger Date, in certain cases, the required approval of holders of at least 75% of the shares entitled to vote generally on the amendment or repeal of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws, or amend or repeal certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation;\n\u00b7\nafter the Trigger Date, the required approval of holders of at least 75% of the shares entitled to vote in an election of directors to remove directors, which removal may only be for cause; and\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue new series of, and designate the terms of, preferred stock, without stockholder approval, which could be used to, among other things, institute a rights plan that would have the effect of significantly diluting the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the DGCL may affect the ability of an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d to engage in certain business combinations, for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder.\u201d We have elected in our certificate of incorporation not to be subject to Section 203 of the DGCL. Nevertheless, our certificate of incorporation will contain provisions that have the same effect as Section 203 of the DGCL, except that they provide that the Sponsors and their transferees will not be deemed to be \u201cinterested stockholders,\u201d and accordingly will not be subject to such restrictions.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Because our board is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt to replace current members of our management team. As a result, you may lose your ability to sell your stock for a price in excess of the prevailing market price due to these protective measures, and efforts by stockholders to change the direction or management of the Company may be unsuccessful.\nOur operating results and share price may be volatile, and the market price of our common stock may drop below the price you pay.\nOur quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future as a publicly traded company. In addition, securities markets worldwide have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could subject the market price of our shares to wide price fluctuations regardless of our operating performance. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above price which you paid or at all. Our operating results and the trading price of our shares may fluctuate in response to various factors, including:\n\u00b7\nmarket conditions in the broader stock market;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results;\n\u00b7\nintroduction of new products or services by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nissuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u00b7\nresults of operations that vary from expectations of securities analysis and investors;\n\u00b7\nguidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance or our failure to meet this guidance;\n\u00b7\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nannouncement by us, our competitors or our vendors of significant contracts or acquisitions;\n\u00b7\ncharges to our earnings resulting from impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets;\n\u00b7\nrestructuring-related charges;\n\u00b7\nsales, or anticipated sales, of large blocks of our stock;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nregulatory, legal or political developments;\n\u00b7\npublic response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC;\n\u00b7\nlitigation and governmental investigations;\n\u00b7\nchanging economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nchanges in accounting principles;\n\u00b7\ndefault under agreements governing our indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nexchange rate fluctuations; and\n\u00b7\nother events or factors, including those from natural disasters, war, actors of terrorism or responses to these events.\nThese and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, may cause our operating results and the market price and demand for our shares to fluctuate substantially. While we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results, fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares and may otherwise negatively affect the market price and liquidity of our shares. In addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation.\nSince we have no current plans to pay regular cash dividends on our common stock, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nAlthough we have previously declared dividends to our stockholders, we do not anticipate paying any regular cash dividends on our common stock. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is, and may be, limited by covenants of existing and any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur, including under IMS Health\u2019s third amended and restated credit agreement and related security and other documents for the senior secured term loan facilities and the senior secured revolving facility (collectively, the \u201cSenior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d) and the 6% Senior Notes (as defined herein). The Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the 6% Senior Notes restrict IMS Health\u2019s ability to pay dividends and make certain other distributions by imposing caps on the aggregate amount thereof as well as certain other conditions including, in some cases, financial incurrence tests, to declare and pay\nsuch dividends and distributions. Therefore, any return on investment in our common stock is solely dependent upon the appreciation of the price of our common stock on the open market, which may not occur.\nWe are a holding company with nominal net worth and will depend on dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries to pay any dividends.\nIMS Health Holdings, Inc. is a holding company with nominal net worth. We do not have any material assets or conduct any business operations other than our investments in our subsidiaries. Our business operations are conducted primarily out of our indirect operating subsidiary, IMS Health and its subsidiaries. As a result, notwithstanding any restrictions on payment of dividends under our existing indebtedness, our ability to pay dividends, if any, will be dependent upon cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from our subsidiaries, including from IMS Health. Payments to us by our subsidiaries will be contingent upon their respective earnings and subject to any limitations on the ability of such entities to make payments or other distributions to us.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our shares or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our shares will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our share price could decline.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting obligations on our indebtedness.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2014, our total indebtedness was $3,816 million (excluding capital lease obligations), consisting of borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the 6% Senior Notes. As of December 31, 2014, certain of our subsidiaries have an additional $285 million of unused commitments outstanding under the revolving portion of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (excluding outstanding letters of credit, if any). Under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, certain of our subsidiaries have the right to request additional commitments for new term loans and to increase the size of the existing revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed (i) $300.0 million and (ii) the amount of new term loans and increased revolving credit commitments such that the senior secured first lien net leverage ratio shall be no greater than 3.75 to 1.00 after giving effect to such increases (assuming such revolving credit commitments are fully borrowed).\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and increase the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness, combined with our other existing and any future financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u00b7\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations under any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, selling and marketing efforts, research and development and other purposes;\n\u00b7\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have relatively less indebtedness;\n\u00b7\ncause us to incur substantial fees from time to time in connection with debt amendments or refinancings;\n\u00b7\nincrease our exposure to rising interest rates because a portion of our borrowings is at variable interest rates;\n\u00b7\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u00b7\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; and\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds, or to dispose of assets to raise funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, selling and marketing efforts, research and development and other corporate purposes.\nDespite our level of indebtedness, we are able to incur more debt and undertake additional obligations. Incurring such debt or undertaking such additional obligations could further exacerbate the risks our indebtedness poses to our financial condition.\nWe, including our subsidiaries, may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indentures governing the outstanding notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and any indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent our subsidiaries from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness, may be waived by certain votes of debt holders and, if our subsidiaries refinance existing indebtedness, such refinancing indebtedness may contain fewer restrictions on our subsidiaries\u2019 activities. To the extent new indebtedness is added to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 currently anticipated indebtedness levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries face could intensify.\nWhile the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indentures governing IMS Health\u2019s and Healthcare Technology Intermediate, Inc.\u2019s, our wholly-owned subsidiary, outstanding notes also contain restrictions on making certain loans and investments, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the investments incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial.\nRestrictions imposed in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and IMS Health\u2019s and Healthcare Technology Intermediate, Inc.\u2019s other outstanding indebtedness, including the indentures governing IMS Health\u2019s and Healthcare Technology Intermediate, Inc.\u2019s outstanding notes, may limit our ability to operate our business and to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities.\nThe terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities restrict IMS Health and its restricted subsidiaries from engaging in specified types of transactions. These covenants restrict the ability of IMS Health and its restricted subsidiaries, among other things, to:\n\u00b7\nincur liens;\n\u00b7\nmake investments and loans;\n\u00b7\nincur indebtedness or guarantees;\n\u00b7\nissue preferred stock of a restricted subsidiary;\n\u00b7\nissue disqualified equity;\n\u00b7\nengage in mergers, acquisitions and asset sales;\n\u00b7\ndeclare dividends, make payments or redeem or repurchase equity interests;\n\u00b7\nalter the business IMS Health and its restricted subsidiaries conduct;\n\u00b7\nmake restricted payments;\n\u00b7\nenter into agreements limiting restricted subsidiary distributions;\n\u00b7\nprepay, redeem or purchase certain indebtedness; and\n\u00b7\nengage in certain transactions with affiliates.\nIn addition, the revolving credit facility and the new term loans under our senior secured credit facility require IMS Health to comply with a quarterly maximum senior secured net leverage ratio test and minimum interest coverage ratio test, which become more restrictive over time. IMS Health\u2019s ability to comply with these financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and IMS Health may not be able to satisfy them. Additionally, the restrictions contained in the indentures governing the outstanding notes could also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs or make acquisitions or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or the indentures governing the outstanding notes, which could trigger acceleration of our indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of or default under any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial results. In the event of any default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the applicable lenders could elect to terminate borrowing commitments and declare all borrowings and loans outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and other obligations, to be due and payable. In addition, or in the alternative, the applicable lenders could exercise their rights under the security documents entered into in connection with the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Healthcare Technology Intermediate Holdings, Inc., IMS Health and the other subsidiary guarantors have pledged substantially all of their tangible and intangible assets (subject to customary exceptions) as collateral under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including the stock and the assets of certain of our current and future wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries and a portion of the stock of certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries.\nIf we were unable to repay or otherwise refinance these borrowings and loans when due, the applicable lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. In the event the applicable lenders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. Any acceleration of amounts due under the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or the exercise by the applicable lenders of their rights under the security documents would likely have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our planned capital expenditures, acquisitions and other ongoing liquidity needs depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities or that future borrowings will be available to IMS Health or certain of its subsidiaries under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or otherwise in an amount sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness and fund our planned capital expenditures, acquisitions and other ongoing liquidity needs.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indentures governing the outstanding notes restrict the ability of IMS Health and its restricted subsidiaries to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from any such disposition. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our debt service obligations.\nA ratings downgrade or other negative action by a ratings organization could adversely affect the trading price of the shares of our common stock.\nCredit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for companies they follow. The condition of the financial and credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. In addition, developments in our business and operations could lead to a ratings downgrade for us or our subsidiaries. Any such fluctuation in the rating of us or our subsidiaries may impact our ability to access debt markets in the future or increase our cost of future debt which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition, which in return may adversely affect the trading price of shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 84020, "SIC": 8700, "TIC": "IMS"}
