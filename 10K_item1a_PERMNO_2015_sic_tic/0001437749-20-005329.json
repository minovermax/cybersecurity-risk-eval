{"cik": "743238", "company": "SPARTAN MOTORS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nOur financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, many of which are not exclusively within our control that may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance. The risks described below are the risks known to us that we believe could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. However, these risks may not be the only risks we face. Our business could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us, factors we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations, or factors that emerge as new risks in the future.\nGeneral economic, market, and/or political conditions, whether on a global, national, or more regional scale, could have a negative effect on our business.\nConcerns regarding acts of terrorism, armed conflicts, natural disasters, budget shortfalls, cyber events, civil unrest, governmental actions, and epidemics have in the past and could in the future create significant uncertainties that may have material and adverse effects on consumer demand (particularly the specialty and motor home markets), shipping and transportation, the availability of manufacturing components, commodity prices and our ability to engage in overseas markets as tariffs are implemented. An economic recession, whether resulting from one of these events or others, would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur efforts to remediate a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting may not be as effective as we currently expect and, in any event, will result in increased costs in the short-term.\nAs disclosed under Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2019 due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. As disclosed in more detail in Item 9A below, the material weakness relates to our processes for recognizing revenue within our FVS business unit.\nBy definition, a material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have concluded that our consolidated financial statements included within this Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented, in conformity with GAAP. However, if not effectively and timely corrected, the deficiencies noted in our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls as of December 31, 2019 present the risk that future financial statements could contain a material misstatement.\nWe have already started to implement efforts to remediate these deficiencies and expect that the remediation of this material weakness will be completed prior to the end of fiscal 2020. However, if our remediation efforts take longer than expected or are more difficult to implement than expected, we continue to run the risk of a misstatement of our financial statements. And, even if our remediation efforts are effective, they will result in certain increased costs and expenses, which will negatively impact our near-term financial performance.\nThe integration of businesses or assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future involves challenges that could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have pursued and expect we will continue to selectively pursue, acquisitions of businesses or assets in order to diversify, expand our capabilities, enter new markets, or increase our market share. Integrating any newly acquired business or assets can be expensive and can require a great deal of management time and other resources. If we are unable to successfully integrate the newly acquired businesses with our existing business, we may not realize the synergies we expect from the acquisition and our business and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nThe divestiture of our emergency response business could negatively impact our future financial performance.\nEffective February 1, 2020, we completed the sale of our Emergency Response and Vehicle (\u201cERV\u201d) business. Certain aspects of the ERV business were integrated with our continuing operations, including certain information technology, purchasing, human resources, and finance functions and certain physical operations at our Charlotte, Michigan facility. The full separation of the ERV business from our continuing operations and the transition of all aspects of that business to the buyer is expected to take 12 months or more. We expect to incur additional costs and expenses to complete the transition of that business, and we also expect the full separation and transition of that business to divert resources, including certain of our personnel and management resources, away from our continuing operations. Significant systems separation is required to clone, test, cleanse data and support the applications for both the purchaser and our future business during the Transitional Services Agreement. All of these activities represent risk to the ongoing business as well as divert IT resources during this process. In addition, as is generally the case with the sale of a business, we could incur exposure to claims from the purchaser of the ERV business pursuant to the terms and conditions of the purchase agreement. One or more of these matters could have a negative impact on our future financial performance.\nRe-configuration or relocation of our production operations could negatively impact our earnings.\nWe may, from time to time, re-configure our production lines or relocate production of products between buildings or locations or to new locations in order to maximize the efficient utilization of our existing production capacity or take advantage of opportunities to increase manufacturing efficiencies. Costs incurred to effect these re-configurations or re-locations may exceed our estimates, and efficiencies gained may be less than anticipated, each of which may have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nDisruptions within our dealer network could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely, for certain of our products, on a network of independent dealers to market, deliver, provide training for, and service our products to and for customers. Our business is influenced by our ability to initiate and manage new and existing relationships with dealers.\nFrom time to time, we or an individual dealer may choose to terminate the relationship, or the dealership could face financial difficulty leading to failure or difficulty in transitioning to new ownership. In addition, our competitors could engage in a strategy to attempt to acquire or convert our dealers to carry their products. We do not believe our business is dependent on any single dealer, the loss of which would have a sustained material adverse effect upon our business.\nHowever, disruption of dealer coverage within a specific local market could have an adverse impact on our business within the affected market. The loss or termination of a significant number of dealers could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing our products and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. In the event that a dealer in a strategic market experiences financial difficulty, we may choose to provide financial support such as extending credit to a dealership, reducing the risk of disruption, but increasing our financial exposure.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement and manage our growth strategy.\nOur growth strategy includes expanding existing market share through product innovation, continued expansion into industrial and global markets and merger or acquisition related activities. We believe our future success depends in part on our research and development and engineering efforts, our ability to manufacture or source the products and customer acceptance of our products. As it relates to new markets, our success also depends on our ability to create and implement local supply chain, sales and distribution strategies to reach these markets.\nThe potential inability to successfully implement and manage our growth strategy could adversely affect our business and our results of operations. The successful implementation of our growth strategy will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate operations with acquired companies.\nOur efforts to grow our business in emerging markets are subject to all of these risks plus additional, unique risks. In certain markets, the legal and political environment can be unstable and uncertain which could make it difficult for us to compete successfully and could expose us to liabilities.\nWe also make investments in new business development initiatives which, like many startups, could have a relatively high failure rate. We limit our investments in these initiatives and establish governance procedures to contain the associated risks, but losses could result and may be material. Our growth strategy also may involve acquisitions, joint venture alliances and additional arrangements of distribution. We may not be able to enter into acquisitions or joint venture arrangements on acceptable terms, and we may not successfully integrate these activities into our operations. We also may not be successful in implementing new distribution channels, and changes could create discord in our existing channels of distribution.\nIncreased costs, including costs of raw materials, component parts and labor costs, potentially impacted by changes in labor rates and practices and/or new or increased tariffs or similar restrictions, could reduce our operating income.\nOur results of operations may be significantly affected by the availability and pricing of manufacturing components and labor, changes in labor rates and practices, and increases in tariffs or similar restrictions on materials we import. Increases in costs of raw materials used in our products could affect the cost of our supply materials and components, as rising steel and aluminum prices as well as increased tariffs have impacted the cost of certain of our manufacturing components. Although we attempt to mitigate the effect of any escalation in components, labor costs, and tariffs by negotiating with current or new suppliers and by increasing productivity or, where possible, by increasing the sales prices of our products, we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so without it having an adverse impact on the competitiveness of our products and, therefore, our sales volume. If we cannot successfully offset increases in our manufacturing costs, this could have a material adverse impact on our margins, operating income and cash flows. Our profit margins may decrease if prices of purchased component parts, labor rates, and/or tariffs increase, and we are unable to pass on those increases to our customers. Even if we were able to offset higher manufacturing costs by increasing the sales prices of our products, the realization of any such increases often lags the rise in manufacturing costs, especially in our operations, due in part to our commitment to give our customers and dealers price protection with respect to previously placed customer orders.\nDisruption of our supply base could affect our ability to obtain component parts.\nWe increasingly rely on component parts from global sources in order to manufacture our products. Disruption of this supply base due to international political events, natural disasters, the recent outbreak of coronavirus or other factors could affect our ability to obtain component parts at acceptable prices, or at all, and have a negative impact on our sales, results of operations and financial position.\nWhen we introduce new products, we may incur expenses that we did not anticipate, such as recall expenses, resulting in reduced earnings.\nThe introduction of new products is critical to our future success. We have additional costs when we introduce new products, such as initial labor or purchasing inefficiencies, but we may also incur unexpected expenses. For example, we may experience unexpected engineering or design issues that will force a recall of a new product or increase production costs of the product above levels needed to ensure profitability. In addition, we may make business decisions that include offering incentives to stimulate the sales of products not adequately accepted by the market, or to stimulate sales of older or less marketable products. The costs resulting from these types of problems could be substantial and have a significant adverse effect on our earnings.\nAny negative change in our relationship with our major customers could have significant adverse effects on revenues and profits.\nOur financial success is directly related to the willingness of our customers to continue to purchase our products. Failure to fill customers\u2019 orders in a timely manner or on the terms and conditions they may impose could harm our relationships with our customers. The importance of maintaining excellent relationships with our major customers may also give these customers leverage in our negotiations with them, including pricing and other supply terms, as well as post-sale disputes. This leverage may lead to increased costs to us or decreased margins. Furthermore, if any of our major customers experience a significant downturn in their business or fail to remain committed to our products or brands, then these customers may reduce or discontinue purchases from us, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. There were two customers that accounted for 10 percent or greater of consolidated sales in 2019.\nWe depend on a small group of suppliers for some of our components, and the loss of any of these suppliers could affect our ability to obtain components at competitive prices, which would decrease our sales or earnings.\nMost chassis and specialty vehicle commodity components are readily available from a variety of sources. However, a few proprietary or specialty components are produced by a small group of suppliers.\nIn addition, we generally do not purchase chassis for our delivery vehicles. Rather, we accept shipments of vehicle chassis owned by dealers or end-users for the purpose of installing and/or manufacturing our specialized truck bodies on such chassis. There are four primary sources for commercial chassis, and we have established relationships with all major chassis manufacturers.\nChanges in our relationships with these suppliers, shortages, production delays or work stoppages by the employees of such suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our ability to timely manufacture our products and secure sales. If we cannot obtain an adequate supply of components or commercial chassis, this could result in a decrease in our sales and earnings.\nChanges to laws and regulations governing our business could have a material impact on our operations.\nOur manufactured products and the industries in which we operate are subject to extensive federal and state regulations. Changes to any of these regulations or the implementation of new regulations could significantly increase the costs of manufacturing, purchasing, operating or selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines, potential civil and criminal liability, suspension of sales or production, or cessation of operations.\nCertain U.S. tax laws currently afford favorable tax treatment for financing the purchase of recreational vehicles that are used as the equivalent of second homes. These laws and regulations have historically been amended frequently, and it is likely that further amendments and additional regulations will be applicable to us and our products in the future. Amendments to these laws and regulations and the implementation of new regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of federal and state environmental regulations relating to noise pollution and the use, generation, storage, treatment, emission and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Although we believe that we are currently in material compliance with applicable environmental regulations, our failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines, potential civil and criminal liability, suspension of production or operations, alterations to the manufacturing process, costly cleanup or capital expenditures.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarter-to-quarter basis.\nOur quarterly operating results depend on a variety of factors including the timing and volume of orders, the completion of product inspections and acceptance by our customers, and various restructuring initiatives that may be undertaken from time to time. In addition, our Fleet Vehicles and Services segment experiences seasonality whereby product shipments in the first and fourth quarters are generally lower than other quarters as a result of the busy holiday delivery operations experienced by some of its largest customers. Accordingly, our financial results may be subject to significant and/or unanticipated quarter-to-quarter fluctuations.\nOur businesses are cyclical, and this can lead to fluctuations in our operating results.\nThe industries in which we operate are highly cyclical and there can be substantial fluctuations in our manufacturing, shipments and operating results, and the results for any prior period may not be indicative of results for any future period. Companies within these industries are subject to volatility in operating results due to external factors such as economic, demographic and political changes. Factors affecting the manufacture of chassis, specialty vehicles, delivery vehicles and other of our products include but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\nCommodity prices;\n\u25cf\nFuel availability and prices.\n\u25cf\nUnemployment trends;\n\u25cf\nInternational tensions and hostilities;\n\u25cf\nGeneral economic conditions;\n\u25cf\nVarious tax incentives;\n\u25cf\nStrength of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies;\n\u25cf\nOverall consumer confidence and the level of discretionary consumer spending;\n\u25cf\nDealers\u2019 and manufacturers\u2019 inventory levels; and\n\u25cf\nInterest rates and the availability of financing.\nEconomic, legal and other factors could impact our customers\u2019 ability to pay accounts receivable balances due from them.\nIn the ordinary course of business, customers are granted terms related to the sale of goods and services delivered to them. These terms typically include a period between when the goods and services are tendered for delivery to the customer and when the customer needs to pay for these goods and services. The amounts due under these payment terms are listed as accounts receivable on our balance sheet. Prior to collection of these accounts receivable, our customers could encounter drops in sales, unexpected increases in expenses, or other factors which could impact their ability to continue as a going concern and which could affect the collectability of these amounts. Writing off uncollectible accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flow as we have major customers with material accounts receivable balances at any given time.\nOur business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or experience a security breach.\nWe rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain, product engineering, manufacturing, accounting and other business processes. While we believe we have robust processes in place to protect our information technology systems, if these systems are damaged, cease to function properly or are subject to a cyber-security breach such as ransomware, phishing, infection with viruses or intentional attacks aimed at theft or destruction of sensitive data, we may suffer an interruption in our ability to manage and operate the business, and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nLike most corporations, our information systems are a target of attacks. In addition, third-party providers of data hosting or cloud services, as well as our suppliers, may experience cyber-security incidents that may involve data we share with them. Although the incidents that we have experienced to date have not had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, there can be no assurance that such incidents will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future. In order to address risks to our information systems, we continue to make investments in personnel, technologies and training of personnel.\nImplementing new information systems could interfere with our business or operations.\nWe are in the process of implementing new information systems infrastructure and applications that impact multiple locations. These projects require significant investment of capital and human resources, the re-engineering of many processes of our business, and the attention of many associates and managers who would otherwise be focused on other aspects of our business. Should the systems not be implemented successfully, we may incur impairment charges that could materially impact our financial results. If the systems do not perform in a satisfactory manner once implementation is complete, our business and operations could be disrupted and our results of operations negatively affected, including our ability to report accurate and timely financial results.\nRisks associated with international sales and contracts could have a negative effect on our business.\nIn 2019, 2018 and 2017 we derived 2.8%, 3.7% and 3.3% of our revenue from sales to, or related to, end customers outside the United States. We face numerous risks associated with conducting international operations, any of which could negatively affect our financial performance, including changes in foreign country regulatory requirements, the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies, import/export restrictions, the imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade barriers and disruptions in the shipping of exported products.\nAdditionally, as a U.S. corporation, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that are not subject to similar regulations.\nFuel shortages, or higher prices for fuel, could have a negative effect on sales.\nGasoline or diesel fuel is required for the operation of the specialty vehicles we manufacture. There can be no assurance that the supply of these petroleum products will continue uninterrupted, that rationing will not be imposed or that the price of or tax on these petroleum products will not significantly increase in the future. Increases in gasoline and diesel prices and speculation about potential fuel shortages have had an unfavorable effect on consumer demand for motor homes from time to time in the past and may continue to do so in the future. This, in turn, may have a material adverse effect on our sales volume. Increases in the price of oil also can result in significant increases in the price of many of the components in our products, which may have an adverse impact on margins or sales volumes.\nWe could incur asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets or other long-lived assets.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. At least annually, we review goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets for impairment. Identifiable intangible assets, goodwill and other long-lived assets are also reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows. If the operating performance at one or more of our reporting units fails to meet future forecasts, or if future cash flow estimates decline, we could be required, under current U.S. accounting rules, to record impairment charges for our goodwill, intangible assets or other long-lived assets. Any write-off of a material portion of such assets could negatively affect our results of operations or financial position. See \u201cNote 2 - Discontinued Operations\u201d and \u201cNote 7 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets.\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile, which may result in losses to our shareholders.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, among other things, quarterly fluctuations in operating results, a failure to meet published estimates of or changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts, sales of common stock by existing stockholders, loss of key personnel, market conditions in our industries, shortages of key product inventory components and general economic conditions.\nIf there is a rise in the frequency and size of product liability, warranty and other claims against us, including wrongful death claims, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be harmed.\nWe are frequently subject, in the ordinary course of business, to litigation involving product liability and other claims, including wrongful death claims, related to personal injury and warranties. We partially self-insure our product liability claims and purchase excess product liability insurance in the commercial insurance market. We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future claims against us. Any increase in the frequency and size of these claims, as compared to our experience in prior years, may cause the premiums that we are required to pay for such insurance to rise significantly. It may also increase the amounts we pay in punitive damages, which may not be covered by our insurance. In addition, a major product recall or increased levels of warranty claims could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.", "PERMNO": 71985, "SIC": 3711, "TIC": "SHYF"}
