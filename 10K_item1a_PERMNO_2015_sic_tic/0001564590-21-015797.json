RISK FACTORS\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition, and investment in our securities are subject to a number of risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties we face. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, including overall economic and industry conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to general uncertainty and adverse changes in global economic conditions and has heightened, and in some cases manifested, certain of the risks we normally face in operating our business, including those\ndisclosed herein. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are not material also may impair our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and the value of any investment in our securities.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nCyclical demand for products and economic downturns could reduce the demand for, and sales of, our products, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability.\nA significant portion of the FCEP segment\u2019s sales consists of mill rolls to customers in the global steel and aluminum industry that can be periodically impacted by economic or cyclical downturns. Such downturns, the timing and length of which are difficult to predict, may reduce the demand for, and sales of, our forged and cast rolls both in the United States and the rest of the world. Lower demand for rolls may also adversely impact profitability as other competing roll producers lower selling prices in the marketplace in order to fill their manufacturing capacity. Cancellation of orders or deferral of delivery of rolls may occur and produce an adverse impact on financial results. In addition, sales of non-roll product, specifically open-die forged product for the oil and gas industry, are impacted by fluctuations in global energy prices.\nExcess global capacity in the steel industry could lower prices for our products, which could adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability, as well as collectability of receivables and salability of in-process inventory.\nThe global steel manufacturing capacity continues to exceed global consumption of steel products. Such excess capacity often results in manufacturers in certain countries exporting steel at prices significantly below their home market prices (often due to local government assistance or subsidies), which leads to global market destabilization and reduced sales and profitability of some of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 customers, which, in turn, affects our sales and profit margins, as well as collectability of receivables and salability of in-process inventory.\nA reduction in the level of export sales, as well as other economic factors in foreign countries, could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nExports are a significant proportion of our subsidiaries\u2019 sales. Historically, changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly in respect of the U.S. dollar, British pound, Swedish krona and the euro, have impacted the export of our products and may do so again in the future. Other factors that may adversely impact export sales and operating results include political and economic instability, export controls, changes in tax laws and tariffs, and new indigenous producers in overseas markets. A reduction in the level of export sales may have an adverse impact on our financial results. In addition, changes in foreign currency exchange rates may provide foreign roll suppliers with advantages based on those lower foreign currency exchange rates and, therefore, permit them to compete in our home markets.\nFluctuation of the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain of our subsidiaries operate in foreign jurisdictions and, accordingly, earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Since our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period, and assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies will affect the translated value for revenue, expenses and balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies and could materially affect our financial results expressed in U.S. dollars.\nCommodity price increases, as well as any reductions in electricity, gas supply or shortage of key production materials, could adversely impact our production, which could result in lower profitability or higher losses.\nOur subsidiaries use certain commodities in the manufacture of their products. These include steel scrap, ferroalloys, energy and graphite electrodes. Any unexpected, sudden or prolonged price increase may cause a reduction in profit margins or losses where fixed-priced contracts have been accepted or increases cannot be obtained in future selling prices. In addition, there may be curtailment in electricity or gas supply which could adversely impact production. Shortage of critical materials, while driving up costs, may be of such severity as to disrupt production, all of which may impact sales and profitability. The global supply shortage of graphite electrodes used for electric arc furnace melting of our steels could materially impact results of operations should we be unable to secure sufficient supply for our production requirements.\nA work stoppage or another industrial action on the part of any of our unions could be disruptive to our operations.\nOur subsidiaries have several key operations which are subject to multi-year collective bargaining agreements with their hourly work forces. While we believe we have good relations with our unions, there is the risk of industrial action or work stoppage at the expiration of an agreement if contract negotiations break down, which may disrupt manufacturing and impact results of operations.\nDependence on certain equipment may cause an interruption in our production if such equipment is out of operation for an extended period of time, which could result in lower sales and profitability.\nOur subsidiaries\u2019 principal business relies on certain unique equipment such as an electric arc furnace and a spin cast work roll machine. Although a comprehensive critical spare inventory of key components for this equipment is maintained, if any such unique equipment is out of operation for an extended period, it may result in a significant reduction in our sales and earnings.\nThe ultimate liability of our subsidiaries for claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos-containing components historically used in certain products of our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity in the future.\nOur subsidiaries, and in some cases, we, are defendants in numerous claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos-containing components historically used in certain products of our subsidiaries. Through the current year end, our insurance has covered a substantial majority of our settlement and defense costs. We believe that the estimated costs net of anticipated insurance recoveries of our pending and future asbestos legal proceedings should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity. However, there can be no assurance that our subsidiaries or we will not be subject to significant additional claims in the future or that our subsidiaries\u2019 ultimate liability with respect to asbestos claims will not present significantly greater and longer lasting financial exposure than provided in our financial statements. The ultimate net liability with respect to such pending and any unasserted claims is subject to various uncertainties, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe number of claims in the future;\n\u2022\nthe costs of defending and settling these claims;\n\u2022\ninsolvencies among our insurance carriers and the risk of future insolvencies;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that adverse jury verdicts could require damage payments in amounts greater than the amounts for which we have historically settled claims;\n\u2022\npossible changes in the litigation environment or federal and state law governing the compensation of asbestos claimants; and\n\u2022\nthe risk that the bankruptcies of other asbestos defendants may increase our costs.\nBecause of the uncertainties related to such claims, it is possible that the ultimate liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity in the future.\nA change in the existing regulatory environment could negatively affect our operations and financial performance.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws, rules and regulations, including trade policies and tax regimes. We are affected by new laws and regulations, and changes to existing laws and regulations, including interpretations by courts and regulators, whether prompted by changes in government administrations or otherwise. These laws, regulations and policies, and changes thereto, may result in restrictions or limitations to our current operational practices and processes and product/service offerings which could negatively impact our current cost structure, revenue streams, future tax obligations, the value of our deferred income tax assets, cash flows, and overall financial position.\nIn 2018, the United States imposed tariffs of 25% on primary steel imports and 10% on primary aluminum imports into the United States. As consumers of steel and aluminum in some of our products, our cost base is exposed to the impact of this action, or similar actions, on our margins, and we could potentially lose market share to foreign competitors not subject to similar tariffs increases. Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may continue to be affected by these tariffs, or similar actions. Moreover, these new tariffs, or other changes in U.S. trade policy, have resulted in, and may continue to trigger, retaliatory actions by affected countries which could adversely impact demand for our products, as well as impact our costs, customers, suppliers and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, may adversely impact our business.\nNew trade restrictions and regulatory burdens associated with \u201cBrexit\u201d could adversely impact our operations and financial performance.\nOn June 23, 2016, voters in the United Kingdom (the \u201cU.K.\u201d) approved a referendum to exit from the European Union (the \u201cE.U.\u201d), commonly known as \u201cBrexit.\u201d The U.K left the E.U. on January 31, 2020. The E.U. and the U.K. agreed upon the terms of an agreement which sets out the terms of the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the E.U. and includes a transitional period. The transitional period\nended December 31, 2020, without the U.K. entering into trade agreements with several of its primary trading partners, including the E.U. Since trade between the E.U. and U.K. may be subject to tariffs and other restrictions, the effects of Brexit may from time to time cause volatility in the global stock markets, currency exchange rate fluctuations, effects on cross border trade and labor, and political and regulatory uncertainty in the U.K. and across Europe generally. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications of the U.K. leaving the E.U. with no trade agreements in place would have in the near- and long-term and how such withdrawal would affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to achieve expected benefits of restructuring our operations or consummating future divestitures of operations which become non-core to our portfolio.\nWe may, from time to time, divest businesses that become less of a strategic fit within our core portfolio or restructure operations to improve our operating results. Our profitability may be impacted by gains or losses on the sale or restructuring of such businesses and our level of expected cost savings from restructuring actions may not materialize. Additionally, we may be required to record asset impairment or restructuring charges related to these businesses and may in the future become responsible for liabilities which materialize post-divestiture. These issues may adversely impact our financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe could face limitations in availability of capital to fund our strategic plans, including plant and equipment modernization. Additionally, deterioration in our credit profile or increases in interest rates could increase our costs of borrowing and further limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit.\nWe are parties to a Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (as amended, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility collateralized by a first priority perfected security interest in substantially all of our assets. The Credit Agreement provides for borrowings not to exceed $92.5 million but restricts us from incurring additional indebtedness outside of the Credit Agreement, unless otherwise approved by the banks. The Credit Agreement is subject to various affirmative and negative covenants and contains various sub-limits, including those based on type of collateral and borrowings by geographic region. If the financial covenants become difficult to meet or if our borrowing needs increase beyond the prescribed limits, our results of operations and liquidity may be materially adversely affected. In addition, changes in our credit profile could cause less favorable commercial terms for the procurement of materials required to manufacture our products, which also could have a negative impact on our results of operations and liquidity. Further, our access to public debt markets is limited based on our size, credit profile and not being a well-known seasoned issuer, which may result in limitations in availability of capital to fund our strategic plans including plant and equipment modernization.\nWe have significant international operations and sales, and face risks related to global health epidemics such as the coronavirus.\nOutbreaks of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus resulted in significant local governmental measures being implemented to control the spread of the virus, including restrictions on manufacturing and the movement of employees in many regions of the country. The coronavirus has had a significant impact on our business and our financial results and recovery depends on future developments, which remain highly uncertain. Future pandemics may result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn, and also adversely impacting our sales and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions in manufacturing industries.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty and could cause a sustained global recession. It has impacted, and may continue to have a prolonged and severe impact on, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. While the U.S. Department of Homeland Security guidance has identified our domestic businesses as critical infrastructure industries, essential to the economic prosperity, security and continuity of the United States, we have had to periodically and temporarily idled certain operations of our FCEP segment and, consequently, furloughed certain of our employees in response to market conditions. Additionally, the FCEP segment has experienced, and may continue to experience, customer-requested delays of deliveries or, eventually, potential cancellation of orders and significant reductions in demand. We also may experience long-term disruptions to our operations resulting from changes in government policy or guidance; quarantines of employees, customers and suppliers in areas affected by the pandemic; and closures of businesses or manufacturing facilities that are critical to our business or our supply chains. We may also incur higher write-offs of accounts receivables and impairment charges on our asset values, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also could adversely affect our liquidity and ability to access the capital markets. Additionally, government stimulus programs available to us, our customers, or our suppliers, may prove to be insufficient or ineffective. Furthermore, in the event that the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic causes us to be unable to maintain a certain level of excess availability under our revolving credit facility, our availability of funds may become limited, or we may be required to renegotiate the facility on less\nfavorable terms. If we are unable to access additional credit at the levels we require, or the cost of credit is greater than expected, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAlthough our internal control over financial reporting has not been impacted to date, the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively affect it in the future if infections within our workforce are significant or our workforce is required to work from home on a longer term or permanent basis thereby requiring new processes, procedures, and controls to respond to changes in our business environment. We may be susceptible to increased litigation related to, among other things, the financial impacts of the pandemic on our business, our ability to meet contractual obligations due to the pandemic, employment practices or policies adopted during the health crisis, or litigation related to individuals contracting COVID-19 as result of alleged exposures on our premises.\nWhile we have been impacted by the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic - see Part II, Item 7 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will affect our operations, and the industries in which we operate, remains uncertain and will ultimately depend on future developments which cannot be predicted at this time, including, but not limited to, the duration, severity, speed and scope of the pandemic, the length of time required for demand to return and normal economic and operating conditions to resume. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic also may have the effect of exacerbating many of the other risks described herein.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nActions of activist shareholders with respect to us or our securities could be disruptive and potentially costly and the possibility that activist shareholders may contest, or seek changes that conflict with, our strategic direction could cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business.\nActivist shareholders may from time to time attempt to effect changes in our strategic direction and, in furtherance thereof, may seek changes in how we are governed. While our Board of Directors and management team strive to maintain constructive, ongoing communications with all of our shareholders, including activist shareholders, and welcomes their views and opinions with the goal of working together constructively to enhance value for all shareholders, activist campaigns that contest, or conflict with, our strategic direction could have an adverse effect on us because: (i) responding to actions by activist shareholders can disrupt our operations, be costly and time-consuming, and divert the attention of our Board and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition; (ii) perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, instability or lack of continuity which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners; and (iii) these types of actions could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price due to factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nWe may not continue to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange and NYSE American for our common stock and Series A warrants, respectively.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange and our Series A warrants are listed on NYSE American, each of which imposes both objective and subjective requirements for continued listing.\nContinued listing criteria of the New York Stock Exchange applicable to our common stock include our financial condition, market capitalization and shareholders\u2019 equity. Specifically, the New York Stock Exchange requires a company with common equity listed on its exchange to maintain average global market capitalization over a consecutive 30 trading-day period of at least $50 million or maintain shareholders\u2019 equity of at least $50 million. Our common stock\u2019s average-global market capitalization over the 30 trading-day period ended December 31, 2020, was $93.7 million and our total Ampco-Pittsburgh shareholders\u2019 equity was $76.6 million as of December 31, 2020. Should we receive a notice of non-compliance, the New York Stock Exchange may allow up to an 18-month cure period if we present a plan to become compliant, with adequate strategic actions and progress reporting satisfactory to the New York Stock Exchange. If the New York Stock Exchange determines that our common stock fails to satisfy the requirements for continued listing or we continue to fail to meet listing criteria, our common stock could be de-listed from the New York Stock Exchange, which could impact potential liquidity for our shareholders.\nContinued listing criteria of the NYSE American applicable to our Series A warrants include our financial condition, market capitalization and shareholders\u2019 equity. Among other requirements, for the Series A warrants to be listed on NYSE American, there must be an aggregate of at least 50,000 Series A warrants. Satisfaction of NYSE American\u2019s listing requirements therefore depends upon the extent to which warrant holders elect to exercise their Series A warrants. We cannot provide assurance that we will continue to meet these, or other, listing standards of NYSE American with respect to the Series A warrants. Additionally, the price of the Series A warrants may fluctuate, and liquidity may be limited. Holders of Series A warrants may be unable to resell their Series A warrants at a favorable price, or at all.\nHolders of Series A warrants will have no rights as holders of common stock until they exercise their Series A warrants and acquire common stock.\nUntil holders of our Series A warrants acquire shares of common stock upon exercise of such Series A warrants, they will have no rights with respect to the shares of common stock underlying such Series A warrants. Upon exercise of the Series A warrants, the holders thereof will be entitled to exercise the rights of holders of common stock only as to matters for which the record date occurs after the warrant exercise date.\nThe market price of our common stock may not exceed the exercise price of the Series A warrants at such time as the holder desires to exercise such Series A warrants.\nThe Series A warrants are exercisable through August 1, 2025. The market price of our common stock may not exceed the exercise price of the Series A warrants at such times prior to their date of expiration that the holder desires to exercise such warrants. Any Series A warrants not exercised by their date of expiration will expire without residual value to holders.\nWe have not declared dividends since mid-2017 and do not expect to declare dividends in the future. Any return on the investment in our common stock may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe have not declared a cash dividend on our common stock since mid-2017 and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. The declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as our board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on investment in our securities will only occur if the value of our stock price appreciates.\nBecause the Series A warrants are executory contracts, they may have no value in a bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding.\nIn the event a bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is commenced by or against us, a bankruptcy court may hold that any then-unexercised Series A warrants are executory contracts subject to rejection by us with the approval of a bankruptcy court. As a result, even if we have sufficient funds, holders may not be entitled to receive any consideration for their Series A warrants or may receive an amount less than they would be entitled to if they had exercised their Series A warrants prior to the commencement of any such bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nPotential attacks on information technology infrastructure and other cyber-based business disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on integrated information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems to conduct our business. IT systems failures, including risks associated with upgrading our systems or in successfully integrating IT and other systems to common platforms, network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by impeding our processing of transactions, our ability to protect customer or company information and our financial reporting. Our computer systems, including our back-up systems, could be damaged or interrupted by power outages; computer and telecommunications failures; computer viruses; internal or external security breaches; events such as fires, earthquakes, floods, tornadoes and hurricanes; and/or errors by our employees. Cyber-based risks, in particular, are evolving and include potential attacks to our IT infrastructure and to the IT infrastructure of third parties in attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential or other proprietary information or information relating to our employees, customers and other third parties or to seek ransom. Although we have taken steps to address these concerns, there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control, we may not be able to accurately determine our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, our shareholders could lose confidence in our financial results, which could harm the business and the value of our securities.\nEffective internal control is necessary to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to the exemption provided to issuers that are not \u201clarge accelerated filers\u201d or \u201caccelerated filers\u201d under the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting and financial processes in the future. Because our internal control relies on the judgments and determinations of key personnel, the COVID-19 pandemic elevates this risk. We may in the future discover areas of our internal control that need improvement. Furthermore, to the extent our business grows, our internal control may become more complex, and we would require significantly more resources to ensure our internal control remains effective. If we or our independent registered public accounting firm discover a material weakness, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remediated, could reduce the market value of our securities. Additionally, the existence of any material weakness could require us to devote significant time and incur significant expense to identify and remediate any such material weaknesses and we may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses in a timely manner.\nOur By-laws designate the state and federal courts sitting in the judicial district of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania embracing the county in which our principal executive office is located as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers.\nOur By-laws provide that, unless we otherwise consent in writing, the state and federal courts sitting in the judicial district of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania embracing the county in which our principal executive office is located will be the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our shareholders by any director or officer, officer or other employee of ours, (c) any action asserting a claim against us or against any of our directors, officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988 (or the PBCL) or our Articles of Incorporation or By-laws, (d) any action seeking to interpret, apply, enforce, or determine the validity of our Article of Incorporation or By-laws, or (e) any action asserting a claim against the us or any director or officer or other employee of ours governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court outside of Pennsylvania were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 18075, "SIC": 3460, "TIC": "AP"}
