Risk Factors\nThe following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The risks that are described below are not the only ones that we face. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. Although the risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected. Readers should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized.\nRisk Relating to our Business\nThe bearing industry and the industries into which we sell our various power transmission products are highly competitive, and this competition results in significant pricing pressure for our products that could affect our revenues and profitability.\nThe global bearing industry is highly competitive. We compete with many domestic and foreign manufacturers of anti-friction bearings. In addition, the industries into which we sell our power transmission products are also highly competitive. Due to competitiveness within these industries, we may not be able to increase prices for our products to cover increases in our costs or to achieve desired profitability. In addition, we face pressure from our customers to reduce prices, and the contractual nature of business with OE customers, could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. In addition, our customers may choose to purchase products from one of our competitors rather than pay the prices we seek for our products, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nOur business is capital intensive, and if there are downturns in the industries that we serve, we may be forced to significantly curtail or suspend operations with respect to those industries, which could result in our recording asset impairment charges, restructuring charges or taking other measures that may adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.\nOur business operations are capital intensive, and we devote a significant amount of capital to certain industries. Our profitability is dependent on factors such as labor compensation and productivity and inventory and supply chain management, which are subject to risks that we may not be able to control. If there are downturns in the industries that we serve, we may be forced to significantly curtail or suspend our operations with respect to those industries, including laying-off employees, reducing production, recording asset impairment charges and other measures, which may adversely affect our results of operations and profitability. We have taken approximately $46 million in impairment and restructuring charges in the aggregate during the last five years. Changes in business or economic conditions, or our business strategy, may result in additional restructuring programs and may require us to take additional charges in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings.\nChanges in customer preferences and inventory reductions by customers or distributors could adversely affect the Company's business.\nThe Company has previously experienced distributor inventory corrections reflecting de-stocking of the supply chain associated with softer demand in certain markets. The Company's results in a period may be adversely impacted by similar customer inventory adjustments in the future, as well as changes in customer buying preferences.\nAny change in raw material prices or the availability or cost of raw materials could adversely affect our results of operations and profit margins.\nWe require substantial amounts of raw materials, including steel, to operate our business. Our supply of raw materials could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. Prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past, have risen substantially over the past year, and could continue to do so in the future. We generally attempt to manage these fluctuations by passing along increased raw material prices to our customers in the form of price increases or surcharges; however, we may be unable to increase the price of our products, or may experience a lag in doing so, due to pricing pressure, contract terms or other factors, which could adversely impact our revenue and profit margins.\nMoreover, future disruptions in the supply of our raw materials could impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers, impact our ability to manufacture and deliver our products on a timely basis, or require us to pay higher prices in order to obtain these raw materials from other sources. Any significant increase in the prices for such raw materials could adversely affect our results of operations and profit margins.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has, and could continue to, adversely and materially impact our business.\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 and associated variants has negatively impacted our business operations in a number of ways, including: volatility in economic demand; higher levels of absenteeism and reduced labor availability; shipping and logistics delays; supply chain and manufacturing disruptions; and higher levels of inflation for raw material, purchased components, freight and other costs. We could continue to experience these and other impacts from the pandemic, and collectively or individually, these factors could adversely and materially impact our short-term and long-term operations, cost structure, and related results of operations, including revenue, gross margins, operating margins and cash flows.\nWe may not realize the improved operating results that we anticipate from past and future acquisitions and we may experience difficulties in integrating acquired businesses.\nWe seek to grow, in part, through strategic acquisitions, joint ventures and other alliances, which are intended to complement or expand our businesses, and expect to continue to do so in the future. These acquisitions involve challenges and risks. In the event that we do not successfully integrate these acquisitions into our existing operations so as to realize the expected return on our investment or we uncover material issues that were not identified during our due diligence review, our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur operating results depend in part on continued successful research, development and marketing of new and/or improved products and services, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully introduce new products and services.\nThe success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers. Our businesses are affected, to varying degrees, by technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand, which could result in unpredictable product transitions or shortened life cycles, especially as it relates to market and technological changes driven by electrification, environmental requirements, the continued rising importance of e-commerce and increased digitization. We may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production, or marketing of new products and services that may prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market. The end result could have a negative impact on our operating results.\nLoss of our rights to exclusive use of our intellectual property whether through patent infringement, counterfeiting, theft of trade secrets, or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Third-party claims alleging our infringement of intellectual property rights could also have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nWe rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secret laws, invention assignment agreements, confidentiality agreements, and other arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights. These rights are important to our business, and their loss, whether through patent infringement, counterfeiting, theft of trade secrets, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nAdditionally, third parties may bring claims to challenge the validity of our patents or other intellectual property rights or allege that we infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. We may incur substantial costs if our competitors or other third parties allege such claims. If the outcomes of any such disputes are unfavorable to us, we could be subject to damages and reputational harm and our business could be otherwise adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Capital Structure, the Global Financial Markets, and Currency Exchange Rates\nAn increase in our levels of debt and the corresponding impact to our financial covenants or a failure to maintain our credit ratings could limit our ability to invest in our business.\nAn increase in our levels of debt might lead us to have less cash flow available for our business operations, capital expenditures, and strategic transactions and our ability to service our debt obligations or to obtain future financing could be negatively impacted by general adverse economic and industry conditions and interest rate trends. In addition, a failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of borrowing, liquidity and access to capital markets.\nSome of our debt has variable interest rates, which could increase the cost of servicing such debt.\nInterest rates may rise in the future due to anticipated future inflation or other causes. As a result, the costs of servicing our variable interest rate debt could increase even if the amount borrowed under such facilities remained the same. Increased servicing costs could in turn negatively impact our profitability and cash flow.\nThe global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that may affect our asset values, results of operations and competitiveness.\nWe are exposed to the risks of currency exchange rate fluctuations because a significant portion of our net sales, costs, assets and liabilities, are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These risks include a reduction in our net asset values, net sales, operating income and competitiveness.\nFor those countries outside the U.S. where we have significant sales, a strengthening in the U.S. dollar or devaluation in the local currency would reduce the value of our local inventory as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, a stronger U.S. dollar or a weaker local currency would result in reduced revenue, operating profit and shareholders' equity due to the impact of foreign exchange translation on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may make our products more expensive for others to purchase or increase our operating costs, affecting our competitiveness and our profitability.\nChanges in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies and volatile economic, political and market conditions in emerging market countries have in the past adversely affected our financial performance and may in the future adversely affect the value of our assets located outside the United States, our gross profit and our results of operations.\nOur results of operations may be materially affected by conditions in global financial markets or in any of the geographic regions in which we, our customers or our suppliers operate. If an end user cannot obtain financing to purchase our products, either directly or indirectly contained in machinery or equipment, demand for our products will be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and earnings.\nGlobal financial markets have experienced volatility in the past, including volatility in securities prices and diminished liquidity and credit availability. Our access to the financial markets cannot be assured and is dependent on, among other things, market conditions and company performance. Accordingly, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter tenors than we prefer or pay unattractive interest rates, which could increase our interest expense, decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility.\nIf a customer becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to recover accounts receivable from that customer would be affected adversely and any payment we received during the preference period prior to a bankruptcy filing potentially may be recoverable by the bankruptcy estate. Furthermore, if certain of our customers liquidate in bankruptcy, we may incur impairment charges relating to obsolete inventory and machinery and equipment.\nIn addition, financial instability of certain companies in the supply chain could disrupt production in any particular industry. A disruption of production in any of the industries where we participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and earnings. If any of our suppliers are unable or unwilling to provide the products or services that we require or materially increase their costs, our ability to offer and deliver our products on a timely and profitable basis could be impaired. We cannot assure you that any or all of our relationships will not be terminated or that such relationships will continue as presently in effect. Furthermore, if any of our suppliers were to become subject to bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, we may be unable to arrange for alternate or replacement relationships on favorable terms, which could harm our sales and operating results.\nRisks Related to the Global Nature of our Operations\nGlobal political instability and other risks of international operations may adversely affect our operating costs, revenues and the price of our products.\nOur international operations expose us to risks not present in a purely domestic business, including primarily:\n\u2022changes in international treaties or trade unions (e.g., the UK's withdrawal from the European Union, commonly referred to as \"Brexit\"), which may make our products or our customers' products more costly to export or import;\n\u2022changes in tariff regulations, which may make our products more costly to export or import;\n\u2022difficulties establishing and maintaining relationships with local OEMs, distributors and dealers;\n\u2022import and export licensing requirements;\n\u2022compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, including unexpected changes in taxation and environmental or other regulatory requirements, which could increase our operating and other expenses and limit our operations;\n\u2022disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the FCPA;\n\u2022difficulty in staffing and managing geographically diverse operations;\n\u2022disruptions to our global supply chain and logistical issues associated with port closures or congestion, delays or increased costs;\n\u2022tax exposures related to cross-border intercompany transfer pricing and other tax risks unique to international operations; and\n\u2022compliance with data protection regulations.\nThese and other risks also may increase the relative price of our products compared to those manufactured in other countries, reducing the demand for our products in the markets in which we operate, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings.\nWe have global operations, and changes to government trade policies including the imposition of tariffs and other trade barriers, as well as the resulting consequences, could adversely impact our revenue and profit margins.\nThe U.S. government has imposed tariffs on certain foreign goods, including steel and other raw materials as well as certain products made from such materials. Changes in U.S. trade policy have resulted in, and could further result in, U.S. trading partners adopting responsive trade policies that make it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries. In addition, the governments of other countries in which we have substantial operations could impose tariffs on, or restrict trade in, the materials and components necessary for the production of our products. These measures could result in an increase in our production costs. If we are unable to increase the price of our products or otherwise mitigate these increased costs, it could adversely impact our revenue and profit margins.\nRisks Related to Human Capital Management and Employee Benefits\nIf we are unable to attract, retain and develop key personnel, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business substantially depends on the continued service of key members of our management and other key employees. The loss of the services of a significant number of members of our management or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our future success also will depend on our ability to attract, retain and develop highly skilled personnel, such as engineering, finance, marketing and senior management professionals, as well as skilled labor. Competition for these types of employees is intense and has increased recently, and we could experience difficulty from time to time in hiring, developing and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. If we do not succeed in retaining and developing our current employees and attracting new high-quality employees, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWork stoppages or similar difficulties could significantly disrupt our operations, reduce our revenues and materially affect our earnings.\nA work stoppage at one or more of our facilities, whether caused by fire, flooding, epidemics, pandemics (including the COVID-19 outbreak), severe weather, including that caused by climate change, other natural disaster or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, some of our employees are represented by labor unions or works councils under collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and terms. We have experienced work stoppages at certain of our facilities historically at times, and while these stoppages have been short-term in nature, no assurances can be made that we will not experience additional work stoppages due to government directives, employee health concerns, and other types of conflicts with labor unions, works councils, and other similar groups in the future.\nA work stoppage at one of our suppliers could also materially and adversely affect our operations if an alternative source of supply were not readily available. In addition, if one or more of our customers were to experience a work stoppage, that customer could halt or limit purchases of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the credit and default risk or bankruptcy of customers or suppliers as a result of work stoppages could also materially and adversely affect our operations and results.\nExpenses and contributions related to our defined benefit plans are affected by factors outside our control, including the performance of plan assets, interest rates, actuarial data and experience, and changes in laws and regulations, all of which could impact our funded status.\nOur future expense and funding obligations for defined benefit pension plans depend upon a number of factors, including the level of benefits provided for by the plans, the future performance of assets with specific country economic performance risks set aside in trust for these plans, the level of interest rates used to determine the discount rate to calculate the amount of liabilities, actuarial data and experience, and any changes in government laws and regulations. In addition, if the various investments held by our pension trusts do not perform as expected or the liabilities increase as a result of discount rate changes and other actuarial changes, our pension expense and required contributions would increase and, as a result, could materially adversely affect our business or require us to record charges that could be significant and would cause a reduction in our shareholders' equity. We may be required legally to make contributions to the pension plans in the future in excess of our current expectations, and those contributions could be material.\nFuture actions involving our defined benefit and other postretirement plans, such as annuity purchases, lump-sum payouts, and/or plan terminations could cause us to incur significant pension and postretirement settlement and curtailment charges, and require cash contributions.\nWe have purchased annuities and offered lump-sum payouts to defined benefit plan and other postretirement plan participants and retirees in the past. If we were to take similar actions in the future, we could incur significant pension settlement and curtailment charges related to the reduction in pension and postretirement obligations from annuity purchases, lump-sum payouts of benefits to plan participants, and/or plan terminations. Pursuing these types of actions could require us to make additional contributions to the defined benefit plans to maintain a legally required funded status.\nRisks Related to Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Matters\nIf government-imposed restrictions continue, are re-imposed, or are expanded, our business could be further adversely impacted.\nThe global outbreaks of COVID-19 and new variants of the virus continue to create uncertainty with respect to economic demand and operations. The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in significant governmental measures being implemented to control the spread of COVID-19, including, among others, restrictions on travel and manufacturing operations in many regions of the world that are changing frequently as the pandemic evolves. In addition, we have implemented risk mitigation plans across the enterprise (including flexible work-from-home policies, encouraging employee vaccinations, \"social distancing,\" and use of personal protective equipment) to reduce the risk of spreading the virus in many of our global locations. To the extent that governments implement more restrictive mandates to combat the spread of COVID-19 such as vaccination mandates or others, or reimpose restrictions that have now lapsed, or to the extent that the COVID-19 outbreak intensifies, we could experience additional material impacts to our short-term and long-term operations, access to skilled labor or raw materials, and related results of operations, including revenue, gross margins, operating margins and cash flows.\nEnvironmental health and safety laws, regulations, and customer requirements impose substantial costs and limitations on our operations and compliance may be more costly than we expect.\nWe are subject to the risk of substantial environmental liability and limitations on our operations due to environmental laws and regulations. We are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning matters such as air emissions, wastewater discharges, solid and hazardous waste handling and disposal and the investigation and remediation of contamination. The risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to compliance with these laws and regulations are an inherent part of our business, and future conditions may develop, arise or be discovered that create substantial environmental compliance or remediation liabilities and costs.\nCompliance with environmental, health and safety legislation and regulatory requirements may prove to be more limiting and costly than we anticipate. To date, we have committed significant expenditures in our efforts to manage remediation activities and maintain compliance with these requirements at our facilities, and we expect that we will continue to make significant expenditures related to such compliance in the future. From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings brought by private parties or governmental authorities with respect to environmental matters, including matters involving alleged noncompliance with or liability arising from environmental, health and safety laws, property damage or personal injury. Actual or alleged violations of environmental, health and safety laws or environmental permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on operations and substantial civil or criminal fines, as well as, under some environmental, health, and safety laws, the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability. New laws and regulations, including those that may relate to emissions of greenhouse gases, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, new and more stringent customer requirements, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of domestic and foreign laws and regulations that could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of domestic and foreign laws and regulations, and legal compliance risks, including securities laws, tax laws, data privacy laws, employment and pension-related laws, competition laws, U.S. and foreign export and trade laws, government procurement regulations, and laws governing improper business practices. We are affected by both new laws and regulations, and changes to existing laws and regulations which may continue to evolve through interpretations by courts and regulators. Furthermore, the laws and regulations to which we are subject may differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and the risk of noncompliance.\nIn addition, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws as well as export controls and economic sanction laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Recently, there has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our policies mandate compliance with these laws, but we cannot assure you that our internal controls and procedures will always protect us from the improper acts committed by our employees, agents or third-party intermediaries. If we are found to be liable for FCPA, export control or sanction violations, we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, including loss of export privileges or authorization needed to conduct aspects of our international business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAlso, our sales to public-sector customers are subject to complex regulations. Noncompliance with government procurement regulations, information security requirements, or other applicable laws or regulations could result in civil, criminal and administrative liability, termination of government contracts or other public-sector customer contracts, and suspension, debarment or ineligibility from doing business with governmental entities or other customers in the public sector.\nCompliance with the laws and regulations described above or with other applicable foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations currently in effect or that may be adopted in the future could materially adversely affect our competitive position, operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nNew or more stringent government regulations or standards designed to address climate change could increase our operational costs and severe weather associated with a changing climate could negatively impact our operations and those of our customers and suppliers.\nWe are subject to domestic and foreign regulations and standards governing emissions controls which are, in part, designed to address climate change. Due to increasing global concern over the effects of climate change, new or more stringent regulations and standards may be mandated. In addition, various stakeholders (including our investors, customers, and suppliers) may demand additional controls beyond what is required by such regulations or standards. Tighter emissions controls as a result of these actions could increase our operational costs and could lead to disruptions in our operations as compliance is attained. In addition, environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing global greenhouse gas emissions could interfere with our business strategy and operations. Severe weather associated with a changing climate could also negatively impact the operation of our facilities, as well as those of our customers and suppliers.\nRisks Related to Data Privacy and Information Security\nThe Company may be subject to risks relating to its information technology systems, including the risk of security breaches.\nThe Company relies on information technology systems to manage and operate its business and to process, transmit and store sensitive and confidential data, including its intellectual property and other proprietary business information and that of its customers and suppliers. Despite security measures taken by the Company, the Company\u2019s information technology systems (both on-premises and third-party managed) may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, supplier error, malfeasance or other disruptions. We have been and may in the future be subject to attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems. To date, the impacts of prior events have not had a material adverse effect on us. Any such breach in security could expose the Company and its employees, customers and suppliers to risks of misuse of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, production downtimes, litigation and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect the Company's reputation, competitive position, business or results of operations.\nData privacy and security concerns, as well as evolving government regulation, could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.\nWe collect, store, access and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data, including proprietary business information, personal data or other information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and/or customer-imposed controls. We operate in a global environment in which the data privacy regulatory and legal framework is evolving quickly. Moreover, the data privacy laws of the specific jurisdictions in which we operate may vary and potentially conflict. As such, we cannot predict the cost of compliance with future data privacy laws, regulations and standards, future interpretations of current laws, regulations and standards, or the potential effects on our business.\nGovernment enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and a violation of data privacy laws or a security breach involving personal or customer data can result in fines, reputational damage, loss of business, and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWeakness in global economic conditions or in any of the industries or geographic regions in which we or our customers operate, as well as the cyclical nature of our customers' businesses generally or sustained uncertainty in financial markets, could adversely impact our revenues and profitability by reducing demand and margins.\nThere has been significant volatility in the capital markets and in the end markets and geographic regions in which we and our customers operate, which has negatively affected our revenues. Our revenues also may be negatively affected by changes in customer demand, changes in the product mix and negative pricing pressure in the industries in which we operate. Margins in those industries are highly sensitive to demand cycles, and our customers in those industries historically have tended to delay large capital projects, including expensive maintenance and upgrades during economic downturns. As a result, our revenues and earnings are impacted by overall levels of industrial production.\nRising inflationary pressure has resulted in and could further result in increased employee expenses, shipping costs, raw material costs, energy and fuel costs and other costs of production. If we cannot absorb or pass these increases in our costs of production to our customers, our results of operations, profit margins and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIncreases in compensation, wage pressure, and other expenses for our employees have adversely affected our profitability and could continue to do so. These cost increases may result from inflationary pressures that could further reduce our sales or profitability. Inflation could also lead to increases in other operating costs, such as shipping costs, costs of raw materials, and energy and fuel prices. If we are unable to increase the price of our products to offset these cost increases, or experience a lag in doing so, due to pricing pressure, contract terms or other factors, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nWarranty, recall, quality or product liability claims could materially adversely affect our earnings.\nWarranty, recall, quality or product liability claims could materially adversely affect our earnings and brand reputation. In our business, we are exposed to warranty and product liability claims. In addition, we may be required to participate in the recall of a product. If we fail to meet customer specifications for their products, we may be subject to product quality costs and claims, as well as adverse brand reputational impacts. A successful warranty or product liability claim against us, or a requirement that we participate in a product recall, could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and brand reputation.\nIf our internal controls are found to be ineffective, our financial results or our stock price may be adversely affected.\nOur most recent evaluation resulted in our conclusion that, as of December 31, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. We believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place for future periods, including processes related to newly acquired businesses; however, increased risk of internal control breakdowns generally exists in a business environment that is decentralized. In addition, if our internal control over financial reporting is found to be ineffective, investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which may adversely affect our stock price.\nChanges in accounting standards could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, as reported in our financial statements.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"U.S. GAAP\"), which is periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards and related interpretations issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") and the SEC. The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. It is possible that future accounting guidance we are required to adopt, or future changes in accounting principles, could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, as reported in our consolidated financial statements.", "PERMNO": 14795, "SIC": 3562, "TIC": "TKR"}
