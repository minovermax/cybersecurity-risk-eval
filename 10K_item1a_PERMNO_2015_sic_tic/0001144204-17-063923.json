{"cik": "1357971", "company": "Energy Services of America CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-12-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risk and uncertainties described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or not described below also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed and we may not be able to achieve our expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events that are intended as \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d under Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and should be read in conjunction with the section entitled \u201cForward looking statements\u201d.\nOur operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nWe typically experience lower volumes and lower margins during the winter months due to lower demand for our pipeline services and more difficult operating conditions. Also, other items that can materially affect our quarterly results include:\n\u00b7 Adverse weather;\n\u00b7 Variations in the mix of our work in any particular quarter;\n\u00b7 Unfavorable regional, national or global economic and market conditions;\n\u00b7 A reduction in the demand for our services;\n\u00b7 Changes in customer spending patterns and need for the services we provide;\n\u00b7 Unanticipated increases in construction and design costs;\n\u00b7 Timing and volume of work we perform;\n\u00b7 Termination of existing agreements;\n\u00b7 Losses experienced not covered by insurance;\n\u00b7 Payment risks associated with customer financial condition;\n\u00b7 Changes in bonding requirements of agreements;\n\u00b7 Interest rate variations; and\n\u00b7 Changes in accounting pronouncements.\nCredit facilities to fund our operations and growth might not be available.\nOur business relies heavily on having lines of credit in place to fund the various projects we are working on. Should funding not be available, or on favorable terms, it could severely curtail our operations and the ability to generate profits. Energy Services maintains a banking relationship with two regional banks and has lines of credit and borrowing facilities with these institutions. The Company currently has a $15.0 million Operating Line of Credit (2017), of which $9.1 million was outstanding at September 30, 2017. The Company believes this line of credit will provide sufficient operating capital for future projects, but the Company cannot guarantee it will always have access to this line of credit in the future depending on the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nWe have sold Units, each consisting of one share of 6.0% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A and 2,500 shares of Common Stock. If the Preferred Stock is converted to Common Stock, shareholders may experience dilution of their ownership interest.\nAs of September 30, 2013, the Company sold 140 units in a private placement to accredited investors, with an additional 10 units sold during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 for a total of 150 units. As a result of the private placement, an additional 375,000 shares of common stock were outstanding as of September 30, 2017. The Company also issued 56 shares of Preferred Stock to Marshall Reynolds, Chairman of the Board of Directors, in exchange for a debt forgiveness of $1.4 million. Mr. Reynolds did not receive any shares of Common Stock in this transaction. In addition, if the Company elects to allow the holders of the Preferred Stock to choose to convert their Preferred Stock into shares of common stock we would issue an additional 3,433,333 shares of Common Stock, which will result in shareholders experiencing a dilution in their ownership interest.\nAn economic downturn in the industries we serve could lead to less demand for our services.\nIn addition to the effects of an economic recession, there could be reductions in the particular industries that the Company serves. If the demand for natural gas should drop dramatically, or the demand for electrical services drops dramatically, these would in turn result in less demand for the Company\u2019s services.\nProject delays or cancellations may result in additional costs to us, reductions in revenues or the payment of liquidated damages.\nIn certain circumstances, we guarantee project completion by a scheduled acceptance date or are paid only upon achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels. Failure to meet any of these requirements could result in additional costs or penalties which could exceed the expected project profits.\nRevenue and cost estimates on projects may differ from actual results.\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. While the Company believes losses on significant projects have been recorded at September 30, 2017, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates.\nChanges in tax regulations could adversely affect income tax benefits.\nWith potential changes to tax regulations in 2017, the Company\u2019s estimated income tax benefit and net operating loss carryforward could differ from actual results.\nWe may be unsuccessful at generating internal growth.\nOur ability to generate internal growth will be affected by our ability to:\n\u00b7 Attract new customers;\n\u00b7 Expand our relationships with existing customers;\n\u00b7 Hire and maintain qualified employees;\n\u00b7 Expand geographically; and\n\u00b7 Adjust quickly to changes in our industry.\nOur industry is highly competitive.\nOur industry has been and remains competitive with competitors ranging from small owner operated companies to large public companies. Within that group there may be companies with lower overhead costs that may be able to price their services at lower levels than we can. Accordingly, if that occurs, our business opportunities could be severely limited. In addition, our industry competes for energy demand with suppliers of alternative energy sources such as solar and wind.\nThe type of contracts we obtain could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe enter into various types of contracts, including fixed price and variable pricing contracts. On fixed price contracts our profits could be curtailed or eliminated by unanticipated pricing increases associated with the contract.\nChanges by the government in laws regulating the industries we serve could reduce our sales volumes.\nIf the government enacts legislation that has a serious impact on the industries we serve, it could lead to the curtailment of capital projects in those industries and therefore lead to lower sales volumes for our Company.\nMany of our contracts can be cancelled or delayed or may not be renewed upon completion.\nIf our customers should cancel or delay many projects, our revenues could be reduced if we are unable to replace these contracts with others. Also, we have contracts that expire and are rebid periodically. If we are unsuccessful in rebidding those contracts, that could reduce our revenue as well.\nOur business requires a skilled labor force and if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, our ability to maintain our productivity could be impaired.\nOur productivity depends upon our ability to employ and maintain skilled personnel to meet our requirements. Should some of our key managers leave the Company, it could limit our productivity. Also, many of our labor personnel are trade union members. Should we encounter labor problems associated with our union employees or if we are unable to employ sufficient available operators, welders, or other skilled labor, our production could be significantly curtailed.\nOur backlog may not be realized.\nOur backlog could be reduced due to cancellation of projects by customers and/or reductions in scope of the projects. Should this occur, our anticipated revenues would be reduced unless we are able to replace those contracts.\nWe extend credit to customers for purchases of our services and therefore have risk that they may not be able to repay us.\nWhile we have not had any significant problems with collections of accounts receivables historically, should there be an economic downturn our customers\u2019 inability to repay us would be compromised, and this may curtail our operations and ability to operate profitably.\nWe may incur liabilities or suffer negative financial or reputational harm relating to occupational health and safety matters.\nOur operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace. While we are constantly monitoring our health and safety programs, our industry involves a high degree of operating risk and there can be no assurance given that we will avoid significant liability exposure and/or be precluded from working for various customers due to high incident rates.\nOur dependence on suppliers, subcontractors and equipment manufacturers could expose us to risk of loss in our operations.\nOn certain projects, we rely on suppliers to obtain the necessary materials and subcontractors to perform portions of our services. We also rely on equipment manufacturers to provide us with the equipment needed to conduct our operations. Any limitation on the availability of materials or equipment or failure to complete work on a timely basis by subcontractors in a quality fashion could lead to added costs and therefore lower profitability for the Company.\nDuring the ordinary course of business, we may become subject to lawsuits or indemnity claims, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we may in the ordinary course of business be named as a defendant in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings. These actions may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, worker\u2019s compensation, employment discrimination, breach of contract, property damages, civil penalties and other losses of injunctive or declaratory relief. Also, we often indemnify our customers for claims related to the services we provide and actions we take under our contracts with them. Because our services in certain instances may be integral to the operation and performance of our customers\u2019 infrastructure, we may become subject to lawsuits or claims for any failure of the systems we work on. While we carry insurance to protect the Company against such claims, the outcomes of any of the lawsuits, claims or legal proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention from the business. Payments of significant amounts, even if reserved, could adversely affect our reputation, liquidity and results of operations.\nA portion of our business depends on our ability to provide surety bonds. We may be unable to compete on certain projects if we are not able to obtain the necessary surety bonds.\nCurrent or future market conditions, including losses in the construction industry or as a result of large corporate bankruptcies, as well as changes in our surety providers\u2019 assessment of our operating and financial risk, could cause our surety providers to decline to issue or renew, or substantially reduce the amount of bonds for our work or could increase our bonding costs. These actions could be taken on short notice. Since a growing number of our customers require such bonding, should our surety providers limit or eliminate our access to bonding, our performance could be negatively impacted if we are unable to replace the bonded business with work that does not require bonding or if we are unable to provide other means of securing the jobs performance such as with letters of credit or cash.\nOur failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, including those dealing with the handling and disposal of waste products, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other hazardous materials, as well as fuel storage. We also work around and under bodies of water. We invest significantly in compliance with the appropriate laws and regulations. However, if we should inadvertently cause contamination of waters or soils, liabilities for our Company relating to cleanup and remediation could be substantial and could exceed any insurance coverage we might have and result in a negative impact to the Company\u2019s ability to operate.", "PERMNO": 91522, "SIC": 1623, "TIC": "ESOA"}
