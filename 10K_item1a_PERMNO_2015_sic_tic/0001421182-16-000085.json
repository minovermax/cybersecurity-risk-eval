{"cik": "1421182", "company": "Verso Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-04-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to various risks. Set forth below are certain of the more important risks that we face and that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results. Our business also could be affected by other risks that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe are immaterial to our business.\nRisks Relating to our Chapter 11 Filings\nOur voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 and our ability to successfully emerge as a stronger, leaner company is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.\nOn January 26, 2016, Verso and substantially all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, collectively referred to as the \u201cDebtors,\u201d filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. The Chapter 11 proceedings are being jointly administered under the caption In re Verso Corporation, et al., Case No. 16-10163. We will continue to operate our business as \u201cdebtors-in-possession\u201d under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.\nOn March 26, 2016, we filed the Plan with the Bankruptcy Court. In addition to approval by the Bankruptcy Court, the Plan is subject to certain conditions that must be satisfied prior to its implementation. Although we believe that the Plan will satisfy all requirements for confirmation under the Bankruptcy Code, there can be no assurance that the Plan will be approved by the Bankruptcy Court or that the conditions precedent to its implementation will be satisfied or when, if ever, such confirmation and satisfaction will occur. Failure to obtain such confirmation or to satisfy such conditions to implementation may result in lengthier bankruptcy proceedings as we attempt to negotiate and implement an alternative plan of reorganization.\nThe timing of our emergence from bankruptcy and the terms of our emergence may affect our relationship with our creditors, customers, suppliers and employees and have a significant impact on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to continue to operate in bankruptcy and to emerge from bankruptcy will depend on various factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to comply with and operate under the terms of any cash management orders entered by the Bankruptcy Court from time to time, which subject us to restrictions on transferring cash and other assets;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain adequate cash on hand and to generate cash from operations throughout the Chapter 11 proceedings;\n\u2022\nour ability to fund emergence and to fund our operations after emergence from the bankruptcy process on reasonable terms;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain key employees during the pendency of our bankruptcy proceedings;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain good customer and supplier relationships in light of developments in our bankruptcy proceedings and the terms of our emergence and our ability to manage contracts that are critical to our operations; and\n\u2022\nrisks associated with third party motions in Chapter 11 proceedings, which may interfere with the Plan.\nOur businesses, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted by the loss of customers and suppliers.\nDifficulties of providing services while attempting to reorganize our businesses in bankruptcy may make it more difficult to maintain and promote our services and attract customers to our services and to keep our suppliers. As a result of the Chapter 11 proceedings, we may experience collection issues with otherwise valid receivables of certain customers. Adverse resolution of these disagreements may impact our revenues and other costs of services, both prospectively and retroactively. It is too soon for us to predict with any certainty the ultimate impact of these disagreements. Our suppliers, vendors and services providers may require stricter terms and conditions. The loss of any of our customers or suppliers during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases could have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may experience other adverse effects, including, without limitation, a loss of confidence by current and prospective suppliers. Any failure to timely obtain suitable supplies at competitive prices could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 proceedings, we may not be able to retain key personnel or recruit additional qualified personnel, which could materially affect our business and require the incurrence of substantial additional costs to recruit replacement personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the continuing efforts of our senior management team and other key personnel. As a result of the Chapter 11 proceedings, current and prospective employees could experience uncertainty about their future roles. This uncertainty may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key management, sales, marketing and technical personnel.\nAny failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and require the incurrence of substantial additional costs to recruit replacement personnel.\nThe Chapter 11 proceedings limit the flexibility of our management team in running our business.\nWhile we operate our businesses as debtor-in-possession under supervision by the Bankruptcy Court, we are required to obtain the approval of the Bankruptcy Court, and in some cases certain lenders, prior to engaging in activities or transactions outside the ordinary course of business. Bankruptcy Court approval of non-ordinary course activities entails preparation and filing of appropriate motions with the Bankruptcy Court, negotiation with the various creditors\u2019 committees and other parties-in-interest and one or more hearings. The creditors\u2019 committees and other parties-in-interest may be heard at any Bankruptcy Court hearing and may raise objections with respect to these motions. This process delays major transactions and limits our ability to respond quickly to opportunities and events in the marketplace. Furthermore, in the event the Bankruptcy Court does not approve a proposed activity or transaction, we would be prevented from engaging in activities and transactions that we believe are beneficial to us.\nFailure to obtain confirmation of the Plan may result in liquidation or an alternative plan on less favorable terms to holders of claims against us.\nIf the Plan is not confirmed or consummated, there can be no assurance that the Chapter 11 Cases will continue rather than be converted to chapter 7 liquidation cases, or that any alternative plan of reorganization would be on terms as favorable to holders of claims against us as the terms of the Plan. Certain parties in interest may file objections to the Plan in an effort to persuade the Bankruptcy Court that the Plan has not satisfied the confirmation requirements under sections 1129(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code. Even if (a) no objections are filed, (b) all impaired classes of claims accept or are deemed to have accepted the Plan or (c) with respect to any class that rejects or is deemed to reject the Plan, the requirements for \u201ccramdown\u201d under section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code are met, the Bankruptcy Court, which can exercise substantial discretion, may determine that the Plan does not meet the requirements for confirmation under sections 1129(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code. Section 1129(a) of the Bankruptcy Code requires, among other things, (a) a demonstration that the confirmation of the Plan will not be followed by liquidation or need for further financial reorganization, except as contemplated by the Plan, and (b) that the value of distributions to parties entitled to vote on the Plan who vote to reject the Plan not be less than the value of distributions such creditors would receive if our assets were liquidated under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Although we believe that the Plan will meet the requirements for confirmation, there can be no assurance that the Bankruptcy Court will reach the same conclusion. If the Bankruptcy Court determines that the Plan violates section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code in any manner, including, among other things, the cramdown requirements under section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, we have reserved the right to amend the Plan in such a manner so as to satisfy the requirements of section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nIf a liquidation or protracted reorganization were to occur, the distributions to holders of claims may be materially reduced. In a liquidation under chapter 7, holders of claims could receive substantially less because of the inability in a liquidation to realize the greater going-concern value of our assets. Administrative expenses of a liquidation or a protracted reorganization could also cause a substantial erosion of the value of our business. Substantial additional claims against us may also arise by reason of a protracted reorganization or liquidation, including from the rejection or other breach of previously assumed unexpired leases and other executory contracts, thereby further reducing distributions to holders of claims against us.\nIn addition, even if our cases are not converted to cases under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, if we are unable to timely confirm and consummate the Plan, we may be forced to operate in bankruptcy for an extended period of time while we try to formulate a different plan of reorganization. Such a scenario could jeopardize our relationships with key vendors and suppliers, customers and employees, which, in turn, would have an adverse effect on our operations. A material deterioration in our operations likely would diminish recoveries under any subsequent chapter 11 plan.\nWe may be unable to maintain compliance with the financial maintenance or other covenants in our DIP Facilities, which could result in an event of default under the credit agreements governing the DIP Facilities that, if not cured or waived, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe DIP Facilities provide for specific milestones that we must achieve by specific target dates and financial maintenance and restrictive covenants.\nEach of the DIP Facilities contains certain milestone requirements relating to confirmation of an acceptable plan of reorganization. There can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy such milestones. Should we fail to satisfy the milestones in any of the DIP Facilities, such failure could have significant adverse consequences for us. Specifically, in the event that we fail to satisfy the near-term milestones in the NewPage Term Loan DIP Facility, which require, among other things, that the Plan be confirmed no later than July 4, 2016 and that the effective date of the Plan occur no later than 30 days thereafter, the lenders under that facility would have the ability to direct the NewPage Debtors (as defined in the RSA) to commence a sale process with respect to one, or substantially all, of their mills. In the event that such lenders were to exercise such sale direction rights, the informal committee of holders of Verso Holdings\u2019 first lien debt would have the right (in consultation with the holders of other claims against Verso Holdings) to direct a sale of substantially all of the assets of the Verso Debtors (as defined in the RSA). If the lenders under the NewPage Term Loan DIP Facility and the informal committee of holders of Verso Holdings\u2019 first lien debt were to exercise their sale direction rights, it is likely that the Plan would not be confirmed, and recoveries ultimately realized by creditors of the Verso Debtors and NewPage Debtors from such sale processes could be materially less than the recoveries provided in the Plan.\nWe are also required to comply with a minimum EBITDA covenant tested monthly, beginning March 31, 2016, and, for the Verso DIP Facility, a minimum availability covenant tested at the close of each business day of $5 million until July 28, 2016, $7.5 million from July 28, 2016 to January 28, 2017 and $10 million thereafter, and for the NewPage DIP ABL Facility, a minimum availability covenant at any time of $15 million until January 28, 2017, increasing to $20 million thereafter. If we breach any such covenants and such breach is not cured or waived, the lenders under such credit facilities:\n\u2022\nwould not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;\n\u2022\ncould elect to declare all borrowings outstanding under such DIP Facility, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, due and payable and could demand cash collateral for all letters of credit issued thereunder; and/or\n\u2022\ncould apply all of our available cash that is subject to the cash sweep mechanism of such DIP Facility to repay these borrowings;\nany or all of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPursuit of litigation by the parties in interest, including litigation over our Shared Services Agreement, could disrupt the confirmation of the Plan and could have material adverse effects on our businesses and financial condition.\nCertain of our creditors have the right to send us a notice requesting that Verso and NewPage commence an adversary proceeding or contested matter before the Bankruptcy Court to obtain a judgment concerning the amount due, under applicable law, from the NewPage Debtors to the Verso Debtors (or vice versa) on account of the services provided under the Shared Services Agreement since the Petition Date. In addition, beginning on July 24, 2016, either Verso or NewPage may commence litigation regarding the assumption or rejection of the Shared Services Agreement, including but not limited to moving to assume or reject the Shared Services Agreement and/or moving to compel the other party to assume or reject the Shared Services Agreement by a date certain. Such litigation could be costly and impede the Debtors\u2019 progress toward confirmation of the Plan (which, in turn, could cause the Debtors to fail to satisfy the applicable milestones under the DIP Credit Agreements or the Restructuring Support Agreement).\nIn addition, the allocation of equity contained in the Plan is premised on certain assumptions regarding the Verso Debtors\u2019 and NewPage Debtors\u2019 respective entitlements under the Shared Services Agreement. There can be no assurance that any determination by the Bankruptcy Court as to the Verso Debtors\u2019 and NewPage Debtors\u2019 entitlements under the Shared Services Agreement would be consistent with those assumptions, and to the extent such determination were not consistent with such assumptions, the Debtors\u2019 ability to obtain confirmation of the Plan would be jeopardized.\nThere can also be no assurance that any parties in interest will not pursue any other litigation strategies to enforce claims against the Debtors. Litigation is by its nature uncertain and there can be no assurance of the ultimate resolution of such claims. Any litigation may be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to our normal business operations and the Plan confirmation process, and a resolution of any such strategies that is unfavorable to us could have a material adverse effect on the Plan confirmation process or our respective businesses, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flow.\nTermination of our exclusive right to file a chapter 11 plan and the exclusive right to solicit acceptances could result in competing plans of reorganization, which could have less favorable terms or result in significant litigation and expenses.\nWe currently have the exclusive right to file a chapter 11 plan through and including May 25, 2016, and the exclusive right to solicit acceptances of any such plan through July 25, 2016. Such deadlines may be extended from time to time \u201cfor cause\u201d (as permitted by section 1121(d) of the Bankruptcy Code) with the approval of the Bankruptcy Court. However, it is also possible that (a) parties in interest could seek to shorten or terminate such exclusive plan filing and solicitation periods \u201cfor cause\u201d (as permitted by section 1121(d) of the Bankruptcy Code)) or (b) that such periods could expire without extension.\nIf our exclusive plan filing and solicitation periods expire or are terminated, other parties in interest will be permitted to file alternative plans of reorganization. There can be no assurances that recoveries under any such alternative plan would be as favorable to creditors as the Plan. In addition, the proposal of competing plans of reorganization may entail significant litigation and significantly increase the expenses of administration of the Debtors\u2019 cases, which could deplete creditor recoveries under any plan.\nIf conditions to the Plan are not satisfied or waived, the Plan may fail to be confirmed.\nThe Plan provides for certain conditions that must be satisfied (or waived) prior to its effective date, including the condition that we will have access to funding under certain credit facilities upon exit from the Chapter 11 process, and that we will have received all authorizations, consents, and regulatory approvals necessary to implement the Plan. Certain of the conditions are outside of our control.\nIn the event that such conditions are not satisfied (or waived) prior to the effective date of the Plan, there can be no assurance that the Chapter 11 Cases would not be converted to chapter 7 liquidation cases or that any new chapter 11 plan would be as favorable to holders of claims against the Debtors as the current Plan.\nIf the RSA is terminated, our ability to confirm and consummate the Plan could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe RSA contains a number of termination events, upon the occurrence of which certain parties to the RSA may terminate the agreement. If the RSA is terminated, each of the parties thereto will be released from their obligations in accordance with the terms of the RSA. Such termination may result in the loss of support for the Plan by the parties to the RSA, which could adversely affect our ability to confirm and consummate the Plan. If the Plan is not consummated, there can be no assurance that the Chapter 11 Cases would not be converted to chapter 7 liquidation cases or that any new Plan would be as favorable to holders of claims against the Debtors as the current Plan.\nAs noted above, under certain scenarios, the Chapter 11 Cases could be converted to a case under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, which could result in liquidation of our assets.\nIf no plan can be confirmed, or if the Bankruptcy Court otherwise finds that it would be in the best interest of our creditors, any of the Chapter 11 Cases may be converted to a case under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, pursuant to which a trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code. A liquidation under chapter 7 could result in no distributions being made to unsecured creditors and smaller distributions being made to our secured lenders than those provided for in the Plan because of (a) the likelihood that the assets would have to be sold or otherwise disposed of in a disorderly fashion over a short period of time, rather than our businesses being reorganized as a going concern; (b) additional administrative expenses involved in the appointment of a trustee; and (c) additional expenses and claims, some of which would be entitled to priority, which would be generated during the liquidation, and from the rejection of leases and other executory contracts in connection with a cessation of our operations.\nTrading in our securities during the Chapter 11 proceedings is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. It is probable that our common stock will be canceled and that holders of common stock will not receive any distribution with respect to, or be able to recover any portion of, their investments.\nAt this time it is not possible to predict the ultimate effect of the Chapter 11 reorganization on our business, various creditors and security holders, or when it may be possible to emerge from Chapter 11. We believe that under any reorganization plan our common stock will be substantially diluted or canceled in its entirety and the holders thereof will not be entitled to receive, and will not receive or retain, any property or interest in property on account of such equity interests. In the event of a cancellation of these equity interests, amounts invested by such holders in our outstanding equity securities will not be recoverable. Consequently, our currently outstanding common stock would have no value. Trading prices for our common stock are very volatile and may bear little or no relationship to the actual recovery, if any, by the holders of such securities in the Chapter 11\nproceedings. Accordingly, we urge that extreme caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in our equity securities and any of our other securities.\nAdverse publicity in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases or otherwise could negatively affect our businesses.\nAdverse publicity or news coverage relating to us, including, but not limited to, publicity or news coverage in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, may negatively impact our efforts to establish and promote name recognition and a positive image after emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases.\nHistorical financial information may not be comparable.\nAs a result of the consummation of the Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby, our financial condition and results of operations from and after the effective date of the Plan may not be comparable to the financial condition or results of operations reflected in our historical financial statements.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nWe may not be able to match our prior level of performance following our restructuring contemplated by the Plan.\nFollowing the restructuring contemplated by the Plan, we may be unable to match our prior performance or meet our target performance expectations. For example, some of our customers may decide to reduce their orders or terminate their relationships with us.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of the NewPage acquisition and the continued integration of NewPage may require additional costs and divert the attention of our management from operations.\nThe rationale for the NewPage acquisition was, in large part, predicated on the ability to realize cost savings through the combination of the two companies. Achieving these cost savings is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. An inability to realize the full extent of, or any of, the anticipated benefits of the NewPage acquisition could have an adverse effect upon our revenues, expenses, operating results and financial condition.\nOur continued integration of NewPage may be difficult, unpredictable, and subject to delay because of possible company culture conflicts and different opinions on technical decisions and product roadmaps. We must integrate or, in some cases, replace numerous systems, including those involving management information, purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, billing, employee benefits, payroll and regulatory compliance, many of which are dissimilar. Such difficulties associated with integration, among others, could have a material adverse effect on the combined company\u2019s business.\nWe have also incurred significant costs in connection with the integration of NewPage and expect to continue to incur significant costs with our ongoing integration efforts, including legal, accounting, financial advisory and other costs. The continued integration of Verso\u2019s and NewPage\u2019s operations, products and personnel may also place a significant burden on management and other internal resources. Matters related to the continued integration may require commitments of time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that might have been beneficial to us. The diversion of management\u2019s attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could harm our business, financial conditions and operating results.\nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive.\nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive. Competition is based largely on price. We compete with foreign producers, some of which are lower cost producers than we are or are subsidized by certain foreign governments. We also face competition from numerous North American coated paper manufacturers. Some of our competitors have advantages over us, including lower raw material and labor costs and are subject to fewer environmental and governmental regulations.\nFurthermore, some of these competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do or may be better positioned than we are to compete for certain opportunities. There is no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete effectively in the markets we serve.\nCompetition could cause us to lower our prices or lose sales to competitors, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, the following factors will affect our ability to compete:\n\u2022\nproduct availability;\n\u2022\nthe quality of our products;\n\u2022\nour breadth of product offerings;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain plant efficiencies and to achieve high operating rates;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing costs per ton;\n\u2022\ncustomer service and our ability to distribute our products on time; and\n\u2022\nthe availability and/or cost of wood fiber, market pulp, chemicals, energy and other raw materials and labor.\nWe have limited ability to pass through increases in our costs to our customers. Increases in our costs or decreases in demand and prices for printing and writing paper could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur earnings are sensitive to price changes in coated paper. Fluctuations in paper prices (and coated paper prices in particular) historically have had a direct effect on our net income (loss) and EBITDA for several reasons:\n\u2022\nMarket prices for paper products are a function of supply and demand, factors over which we have limited control. We therefore have limited ability to control the pricing of our products. Market prices of grade No. 3, 60 lb. basis weight paper, which is an industry benchmark for coated freesheet paper pricing, have fluctuated since 2000 from a high of $1,100 per ton to a low of $705 per ton. In addition, market prices of grade No. 5, 34 lb. basis weight paper, which is an industry benchmark for coated groundwood paper pricing, have fluctuated between a high of $1,120 per ton to a low of $795 per ton over the same period. Prices are expected to remain low in 2016. Because market conditions determine the price for our paper products, the price for our products could fall below our cash production costs.\n\u2022\nMarket prices for paper products typically are not directly affected by raw material costs or other costs of sales, and consequently we have limited ability to pass through increases in these raw materials and/or other sales costs to our customers absent increases in the market price. Thus, even though our costs may increase, we may not have the ability to increase the prices for our products, or the prices for our products may decline.\n\u2022\nThe manufacturing of coated paper is highly capital-intensive and a large portion of our operating costs are fixed. Additionally, paper machines are large, complex machines that operate more efficiently when operated continuously. Consequently, both we and our competitors typically continue to run our machines whenever marginal sales exceed the marginal costs, adversely impacting prices at times of lower demand.\nTherefore, our ability to achieve acceptable margins is principally dependent on (a) our cost structure, (b) changes in the prices of raw materials, electricity, energy and fuel, which will represent a large component of our operating costs and will fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control and (c) general conditions in the paper market including the demand for paper products, the amount of foreign imports, the amount spent on advertising, the circulation of magazines and catalogs, the use of electronic readers and other devices, and postal rates. Any one or more of these economic conditions could affect our sales and operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe paper industry has been facing a long-term structural decline and our profitability has been adversely impacted by such decline.\nThe coated paper industry faces a long-term, structural decline. From 2012 to 2015, demand for printing and writing paper in the United States fell by roughly 10%. U.S. demand for coated freesheet has declined 4% from 2012 to 2015. Similarly, U.S. demand for coated groundwood has declined 25% from 2012 to 2015. The demand for coated paper is expected to continue to steadily decline in the future, with market volumes in 2016 projected to be 4% below 2015 levels.\nFluctuations in supply and demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The paper industry is a commodity market to a significant extent and is subject to cyclical market pressures. For example, from 2010 to 2014, prior to the acquisition of NewPage, we experienced a year-over-year average revenue decline of approximately 4.9% partly due to prolonged decline in demand for coated paper.\nNorth American demand for coated paper products also tends to decline during a weak U.S. economy. Accordingly, general economic conditions and demand for magazines and catalogs may have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Foreign overcapacity also could result in an increase in the supply of paper products available in the North American market. An increased supply of paper available in North America could put downward pressure on prices and/or cause us to lose sales to competitors, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDevelopments in alternative media adversely affect the demand for our products.\nTrends in advertising, electronic data transmission and storage, and the internet have had and likely will continue to have adverse effects on traditional print media, including the use of and demand for our products and those of our customers. Our magazine and catalog publishing customers may increasingly use (both for content and advertising), and compete with businesses that use, other forms of media and advertising and electronic data transmission and storage, particularly the internet, instead of paper made by us. As the use of these alternative media grows, the demand for our paper products likely will decline.\nRising postal costs could weaken demand for our paper products.\nA significant portion of paper is used in periodicals, magazines, catalogs, fliers and other promotional mailings. Many of these materials are distributed through the mail. Future increases in the cost of postage could reduce the frequency of mailings, reduce the number of pages in magazine and advertising materials, and/or cause advertisers, catalog and magazine publishers to use alternate methods to distribute their materials. Any of the foregoing could decrease the demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe depend on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our business. Furthermore, we may have credit exposure to these customers through extension of trade credits.\nOur largest customer, Veritiv Corporation accounted for approximately 20% of our net sales in 2015. In 2015, our ten largest customers (including Veritiv Corporation) accounted for approximately 57% of our net sales. The loss of, or reduction in orders from, any of these customers or other customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, as could significant customer disputes regarding shipments, price, quality, or other matters.\nFurthermore, we extend trade credit to certain of these customers to facilitate the purchase of our products and we rely on these customers\u2019 creditworthiness and ability to obtain credit from lenders. Accordingly, a bankruptcy or a significant deterioration in the financial condition of any of these significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, due to a reduction in purchases, a longer collection cycle or an inability to collect accounts receivable.\nWe are involved in continuous manufacturing processes with a high degree of fixed costs. Any interruption in the operations of our manufacturing facilities may affect our operating performance.\nWe run our paper machines on a nearly continuous basis for maximum efficiency. Any downtime at any of our paper mills, including as a result of or in connection with planned maintenance and capital expenditure projects, results in unabsorbed fixed costs that could negatively affect our results of operations for the period in which we experience the downtime. Due to the extreme operating conditions inherent in some of our manufacturing processes, we may incur unplanned business interruptions from time to time and, as a result, we may not generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our operational needs. In addition, the geographic areas where our production is located and where we conduct our business may be affected by natural disasters, including snow storms, forest fires, and flooding. Such natural disasters could cause our mills to stop running, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, during periods of weak demand for paper products, such as the current market, or periods of rising costs, we have experienced and may in the future experience market-related downtime, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may have insufficient liquidity to successfully operate our businesses.\nWe expect to incur significant costs as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, and our business is capital intensive. We incur capital expenditures on an ongoing basis to maintain our equipment and comply with environmental laws, as well as to enhance the efficiency of our operations. Our total capital expenditures were $64 million in 2015.\nWe are currently financing our operations during our reorganization using cash on hand, borrowings under our DIP Facilities, and cash generated by operations which constitutes cash collateral pursuant to, and in accordance with, final cash collateral orders which were agreed to by our secured lenders and approved by the Bankruptcy Court. We may also dispose of certain of our non-core assets in order to obtain additional liquidity. In the event that we are unable to meet the requirements for borrowing under our DIP Facilities or lose our authority to use cash collateral and we do not have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations such that we need to obtain additional financing, there can be no assurance as to our ability to obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms or at all. The challenges of obtaining financing, if necessary, would be exacerbated by adverse\nconditions in the general economy and the volatility and tightness in the financial and credit markets. These conditions and our Chapter 11 Cases would make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. If we cannot maintain or upgrade our facilities and equipment as we require or as necessary to ensure environmental compliance, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to obtain energy or raw materials, including petroleum-based chemicals at favorable prices, or at all, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe purchase substantial amounts of energy, wood fiber, market pulp, chemicals and other raw materials from third parties. We may experience shortages of energy supplies or raw materials or be forced to seek alternative sources of supply. If we are forced to seek alternative sources of supply, we may not be able to do so on terms as favorable as our current terms or at all. The prices for energy and many of our raw materials, especially petroleum-based chemicals, have recently been volatile and are expected to remain volatile for the foreseeable future. Chemical suppliers that use petroleum-based products in the manufacture of their chemicals may, due to a supply shortage and cost increase, ration the amount of chemicals available to us and/or we may not be able to obtain the chemicals we need to operate our business at favorable prices, if at all. In addition, certain specialty chemicals that we currently purchase are available only from a small number of suppliers. If any of these suppliers were to cease operations or cease doing business with us in the future, we may be unable to obtain such chemicals at favorable prices, if at all.\nThe supply of energy or raw materials may be adversely affected by, among other things, natural disasters or an outbreak or escalation of hostilities between the United States and any foreign power, and, in particular, events in the Middle East or weather events such as hurricanes could result in a real or perceived shortage of oil or natural gas, which could result in an increase in energy or chemical prices. In addition, wood fiber is a commodity and prices historically have been cyclical. The primary source for wood fiber is timber. Environmental litigation and regulatory developments have caused, and may cause in the future, significant reductions in the amount of timber available for commercial harvest in Canada and the United States. In addition, future domestic or foreign legislation, litigation advanced by aboriginal groups, litigation concerning the use of timberlands, the protection of endangered species, the promotion of forest biodiversity, and the response to and prevention of wildfires and campaigns or other measures by environmental activists also could affect timber supplies. The availability of harvested timber may further be limited by factors such as fire and fire prevention, insect infestation, disease, ice and wind storms, droughts, floods, and other natural and man-made causes. Additionally, due to increased fuel costs, suppliers, distributors and freight carriers have charged fuel surcharges, which have increased our costs. Any significant shortage or significant increase in our energy or raw material costs in circumstances where we cannot raise the price of our products due to market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAny disruption in the supply of energy or raw materials also could affect our ability to meet customer demand in a timely manner and could harm our reputation. We are expected to have limited ability to pass through increases in our costs to our customers absent increases in market prices for our products, material increases in the cost of our raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we may be required to post letters of credit or other financial assurance obligations with certain of our energy and other suppliers, which could limit our financial flexibility.\nWe may not realize certain projected synergies, productivity enhancements or improvements in costs.\nAs part of our business strategy, we are in the process of identifying opportunities to improve profitability by reducing costs and enhancing productivity. For example, through our continuous process improvement program, we have implemented focused programs to optimize material and energy sourcing and usage, reduce repair costs and control overhead. We will continue to utilize the process improvement program to drive further cost reductions and operating improvements in our mill system, and have targeted additional profitability enhancements in the next twelve months. Any synergies, cost savings or productivity enhancements that we expect to realize from such efforts may differ materially from our estimates. In addition, any synergies, cost savings or productivity enhancements that we realize may be offset, in whole or in part, by reductions in pricing or volume, or through increases in other expenses, including raw material, energy or personnel. We cannot assure you that these initiatives will be completed as anticipated or that the benefits we expect will be achieved on a timely basis or at all.\nOur calculation of pro forma Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments for cost savings expected to be realized from these initiatives. Although our management believes these estimates and assumptions to be reasonable, investors should not place undue reliance upon the calculation of pro forma Adjusted EBITDA given how it is calculated and the possibility that the underlying estimates and assumptions may ultimately not reflect actual results.\nCurrency fluctuations may adversely affect our competitive position and selling prices.\nWe compete with producers from around the world, particularly in North America. In addition to the impact of product supply and demand, changes in the relative strength or weakness of international currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar, can also affect international trade flows in certain products. A stronger U.S. dollar, as has been recently experienced, may attract imports, thereby increasing product supply and possibly creating downward pressure on prices. On the other hand, a weaker U.S. dollar might encourage U.S. exports, thereby decreasing product supply and possibly creating upward pressure on prices.\nFor instance, the recent strong U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies has resulted in a dramatic increase in imports, particularly from Asia, Europe and Canada. In 2015, for example, coated freesheet imports (net of exports) increased 68% from 2014 levels, and coated groundwood (also referred to as coated mechanical) imports (net of exports) increased 16% from 2014 levels.\nAs imports rise, we face new levels of competition and increased pressure to lower prices to maintain our market share. Compounding this problem, in light of the strong U.S. dollar and the increase in imports, we have been priced out of foreign markets and forced to reduce exports. During 2015, exports industry wide were approximately 13% lower than 2014.\nThe decline in our performance from the recent increase in foreign imports and reduction in exports, coupled with the overall decline in demand, has been significant: sales (as adjusted to include the historical NewPage revenues excluding the divested Biron and Rumford mills) dropped approximately 13.5% in 2015 compared to 2014.\nOur business may suffer if we do not retain our senior management.\nWe depend on our senior management. The loss of services of members of our senior management team could adversely affect our business until suitable replacements can be found. There may be a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and we may be unable to locate or employ qualified personnel on acceptable terms. In addition, our future success requires us to continue to attract and retain competent personnel.\nWork stoppages and slowdowns and legal action by our unionized employees may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, approximately 68% of our hourly workforce were represented by 16 local branches of the following unions: the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Services Workers International Union; the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers; the Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers; the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers; the Office & Professional Employees\u2019 International Union; and the United Association of Journeyman and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry. All represented employees are covered by the Master Labor Agreement 2012-2016, dated as of December 21, 2012, covering wages benefits; certain represented mills also have local agreements covering general work rules. We may become subject to material cost increases as a result of action taken by the labor unions. This could increase expenses in absolute terms and/or as a percentage of net sales. In addition, although we believe we have good relations with our employees, work stoppages or other labor disturbances may occur in the future. Any of these factors could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations, and could compromise our information and the information of our customers and suppliers, exposing us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we rely upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing, and collection of payments from customers. We use information technology systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Additionally, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, the propriety business information of our customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks, and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy. Despite security measures and business continuity plans, our information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance, or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility\nfailures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations, and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on third parties for certain transportation services.\nWe rely primarily on third parties for transportation of our products to our customers and transportation of our raw materials to us, in particular, by truck and train. If any third-party transportation provider fails to deliver our products in a timely manner, we may be unable to sell them at full value. Similarly, if any transportation provider fails to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner, we may be unable to manufacture our products on a timely basis. Shipments of products and raw materials may be delayed due to weather conditions, strikes or other events. Any failure of a third-party transportation provider to deliver raw materials or products in a timely manner could harm our reputation, negatively impact our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis could be adversely affected by the lack of adequate availability of transportation services, especially rail capacity, whether because of work stoppages or otherwise. Furthermore, we may experience increases in the cost of our transportation services, including as a result of rising fuel costs and surcharges (primarily in diesel fuel). If we are not able to pass these increased costs through to our customers, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs or other liabilities upon us and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to a wide range of federal, state, regional, and local general and industry-specific environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions (including greenhouse gases and hazardous air pollutants), wastewater discharges, solid and hazardous waste management and disposal, site remediation and natural resources. Compliance with these laws and regulations, and permits issued thereunder, is a significant factor in our business and may be subject to the same or even increased scrutiny and enforcement actions by regulators. We have made, and will continue to make, significant expenditures to comply with these requirements and permits, which may impose increasingly more stringent standards over time as they are renewed or modified by the applicable governmental authorities. In addition, we handle and dispose of wastes arising from our mill operations and operate a number of on-site landfills to handle that waste. We are required to maintain financial assurance (in the form of letters of credit and other similar instruments) for the projected cost of closure and post-closure care for these landfill operations. We could be subject to potentially significant fines, penalties, criminal sanctions, plant shutdowns, or interruptions in operations for any failure to comply with applicable environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permits. Moreover, under certain environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property, and parties that generate or transport hazardous substances that are disposed of at real property, may be held liable for the full cost to investigate or clean up such real property and for related damages to natural resources. We may be subject to liability, including liability for investigation and cleanup costs, if contamination is discovered at one of our current or former paper mills, other properties or other locations where we have disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, wastes.\nA 2007 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court held that greenhouse gases are subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act. The Environmental Protection Agency, or \u201cEPA,\u201d has subsequently issued regulations applicable to us that require monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA has also issued regulations that require certain new and modified air emissions sources to control their greenhouse gas emissions, which may have a material effect on our operations. The United States Congress has in the past, and may in the future, consider legislation which would also regulate greenhouse gas emissions. It is possible that we could become subject to federal, state, regional, local, or supranational legislation related to climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, cap-and-trade or other emissions.\nOn January 31, 2013, the EPA published its \u201cNational Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Major Sources: Industrial, Commercial and Institutional Boilers and Process Heaters.\u201d The standards, which are technology-based standards that require the use of Maximum Achievable Control Technology or \u201cMACT\u201d for major sources to comply and is referred to as the \u201cBoiler MACT\u201d rule, govern emissions of air toxics from boilers and process heaters at industrial facilities. Certain of our boilers are subject to the new standards, and we may be required to limit our emissions and/or install additional pollution controls.\nLitigation could be costly and harmful to our business.\nWe are involved from time to time, and may currently be involved in, claims and legal proceedings relating to contractual, employment, environmental, intellectual property and other matters incidental to the conduct of our business. Although we do not believe that any currently pending claims or legal proceedings are likely to result in an unfavorable outcome that would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, we may become involved in such claims and legal proceedings that could result in unfavorable outcomes and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could pursue acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions, the success of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the past, we have pursued acquisitions to complement or expand our business, divestures and other strategic transactions. Such future transactions are part of our general strategic objectives and may occur. If we identify an acquisition candidate, we may not be able to successfully negotiate or finance the acquisition or integrate the acquired businesses with our existing business and services. Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, amortization expenses and substantial goodwill. The negotiation of any transaction, its completion, and subsequent integration of any business acquired may be complex and time consuming, involve significant costs and may result in a distraction of management\u2019s attention from on-going business operations. We may be affected materially and adversely if we are unable to successfully integrate businesses that we acquire. Similarly, we may divest portions of our business, which may also have material and adverse effects.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nWe will require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness under the DIP Facilities, and upon exit of the Chapter 11 process, the Exit Credit Agreements, and make planned capital expenditures. Our ability to generate cash or refinance our indebtedness depends on many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including payments under the DIP Facilities and Exit Credit Agreements, and to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash flow in the future and our ability to borrow under the NewPage DIP ABL Facility and Exit ABL Facility, to the extent of available borrowings. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. If adverse regional and national economic conditions persist, worsen, or fail to improve significantly, we could experience decreased revenues from our operations attributable to decreases in wholesale and consumer spending levels and could fail to generate sufficient cash to fund our liquidity needs or fail to satisfy the restrictive covenants and borrowing limitations that we are subject to under our indebtedness.\nBased on current and expected level of operations, we believe cash flow from operations, available cash, and available borrowings under the DIP Facilities will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs during the Chapter 11 process.\nWe cannot assure you, however, that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the DIP Facilities or the Exit ABL Facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt, and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness.\nPrior to our bankruptcy filing, we were a highly leveraged company. As of December 31, 2015, the principal amount of Verso\u2019s total indebtedness was $2,799 million and the principal amount of Verso Holdings\u2019 total indebtedness was $2,822 million (including a $23 million loan from Verso Finance Holdings to Chase NMTC Verso Investment Fund). After our expected emergence from bankruptcy we may continue to have a substantial amount of indebtedness.\nA high degree of leverage could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to, and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as borrowings under our DIP Credit Facilities are subject to variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds.\nThe DIP Credit Facilities contain, and we expect that our Exit Credit Agreements will contain, financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debts. If, as or when required, we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our indebtedness under, or amend or waive the covenants contained in, our DIP Credit Facilities or Exit Credit Agreements, the lenders thereunder would have the right to proceed against the collateral pledged to them to secure the indebtedness.\nRestrictive covenants in our DIP Facilities and the Exit Credit Agreement may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nThe DIP Credit Facilities limit, and we expect the Exit Credit Agreements will limit, our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our stock;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem, or repurchase certain of our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nsell assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with our affiliates; and\n\u2022\nincur liens.\nThe DIP Credit Facilities also require, and we expect the Exit Credit Agreements will require, us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants.\nA breach of any of these restrictive covenants could result in a default under the instruments governing our credit agreements. If a default occurs, the holders of these instruments may elect to declare all borrowings thereunder outstanding, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders under the Verso DIP Facility, NewPage DIP ABL Facility, and our Exit ABL Facility would also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. If we are unable to repay our indebtedness when due or declared due, the lenders thereunder will also have the right to proceed against the collateral pledged to them to secure the indebtedness. If such indebtedness were to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full our secured indebtedness.\nLenders under the DIP Facilities and Exit Credit Agreements may not fund their commitments.\nThere can be no assurance that deterioration in the credit markets or overall economy will not affect the ability of our lenders to meet their funding commitments under the DIP Facilities and Exit Credit Agreements. If a lender fails to honor its commitment under the revolving credit facilities, that portion of the credit facilities will be unavailable to the extent that the lender\u2019s commitment is not replaced by a new commitment from an alternate lender.\nAdditionally, our lenders have the ability to transfer their commitments to other institutions, and the risk that committed funds may not be available under distressed market conditions could be exacerbated if consolidation of the commitments under our revolving credit facilities or among its lenders were to occur.\nRisks Relating to Verso\u2019s Common Stock\nOur common stock was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and is not expected to be listed on any other national securities exchange during our Chapter 11 process.\nOur common stock was suspended at the opening of business on September 21, 2015 and was removed from listing on the New York Stock Exchange, or \u201cNYSE.\u201d We will not be able to re-list our common stock on a national securities exchange during our Chapter 11 process, although our common stock has been trading in the over-the-counter, or the \u201cOTC,\u201d market. The trading of our common stock in the OTC market rather than NYSE may negatively impact the trading price of our common\nstock and the levels of liquidity available to our stockholders. In addition, securities that trade in the OTC market are not eligible for margin loans and our common stock is subject to the provisions of Rule 15g-9 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the \u201cExchange Act,\u201d commonly referred to as the \u201cpenny stock rule.\u201d\nOur common stock is currently traded in the OTC Pink Sheets, which involves additional risks compared to being listed on a national securities exchange.\nSecurities traded in the OTC market generally have significantly less liquidity than securities traded on a national securities exchange due to factors such as the reduced number of investors that will consider investing in the securities, the reduced number of market makers in the securities, and the reduced number of securities analysts that follow such securities. As a result, holders of shares of our common stock may find it difficult to resell their shares at prices quoted in the market or at all.\nFurthermore, because of the limited market and generally low volume of trading in our common stock that could occur, the share price of our common stock could be more likely to be affected by broad market fluctuations, general market conditions, fluctuations in our operating results, changes in the markets perception of our business, and announcements made by us, our competitors, parties with whom we have business relationships or third parties with interests in the Chapter 11 proceedings.\nBecause our common stock trades on the OTC market, in some cases, we may be subject to additional compliance requirements under applicable state laws in the issuance of our securities. The lack of liquidity in our common stock may also make it difficult for us to issue additional securities for financing or other purposes, or to otherwise arrange for any financing we may need in the future.\nIn addition, we expect our common stock will be canceled as part of the terms of the Plan and that holders of common stock will not receive any distribution with respect to, or be able to recover any portion of, their investments. Accordingly, we urge that extreme caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in our common stock.", "PERMNO": 92670, "SIC": 2621, "TIC": "VRS"}
