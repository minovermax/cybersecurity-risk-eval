{"cik": "1021561", "company": "NU SKIN ENTERPRISES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nGiven that members of our sales force are independent contractors in most markets, we do not control or direct their promotional efforts. We do, however, require that our sales force abide by policies and procedures that require them to act in an ethical and consumer-protective manner and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. As a member of direct selling associations globally, we promote and abide by the industry\u2019s codes of ethics and consumer protective standards to support and protect those who sell and purchase our products through the direct selling channel.\nConsumer Group and Sales Network\nOur distribution channel is composed of two primary groups: our consumer group-individuals who buy our products primarily for personal or family consumption and share products with friends and family; and our sales network-individuals who personally buy, use and resell products, and who also find new consumers, and recruit, train and develop new sellers. We strive to develop both our consumer group and our sales network. Our strategy for growing our consumer group is to offer high-quality, innovative products that provide demonstrable benefits. Our strategy for growing our sales network is to provide a meaningful business opportunity for those persons who demonstrate the desire and ability to develop both a consumer group and a team of sellers, including through sales compensation, incentives and recognition.\nTo monitor the growth trends in our consumer group, we track the number of persons who purchased products directly from the company during the previous three months (\u201cCustomers\u201d). We believe a significant majority of Customers purchase our products primarily for personal or family consumption but are not actively pursuing the opportunity we offer to generate income by marketing and reselling products. Our Customer numbers do not include consumers who purchase products directly from members of our sales force.\nTo monitor the growth in our sales network, we track the number of independent distributors, and sales employees and independent marketers in Mainland China, who achieve certain qualification requirements (\u201cSales Leaders\u201d). The following chart sets forth information concerning our Customers and Sales Leaders for the last three years.\nTotal Number of Customers and Sales Leaders by Region(1)\nAs of December 31, 2018\nAs of December 31, 2017\nAs of December 31, 2016\nCustomers\nSales\nLeaders\nCustomers\nSales\nLeaders\nCustomers\nSales\nLeaders\nMainland China\n304,000\n33,100\n193,000\n40,600\n175,000\n22,000\nAmericas/Pacific\n249,000\n8,300\n244,000\n8,900\n184,000\n7,300\nSouth Korea\n182,000\n7,600\n173,000\n8,400\n192,000\n9,600\nSoutheast Asia\n153,000\n8,900\n122,000\n8,000\n98,000\n7,000\nJapan\n130,000\n5,900\n132,000\n6,600\n137,000\n6,700\nHong Kong/Taiwan\n77,000\n4,800\n71,000\n4,700\n73,000\n4,600\nEMEA\n149,000\n4,800\n135,000\n4,700\n129,000\n4,400\nTotal\n1,244,000\n73,400\n1,070,000\n81,900\n988,000\n61,600\n(1)\nOur Velocity sales compensation program enhancements have adjusted the requirements for qualifying and maintaining \u201cSales Leader\u201d status, which could impact the number of independent distributors under our global compensation program who achieve such requirements. For example, the level of sales volume necessary to achieve initial qualification has been increased in some markets, and the enhanced program also provides some flexibility to remain a Sales Leader with lower sales volume for a short time. As of the end of 2017, we had launched Velocity only in the Pacific region within our Americas/Pacific segment, and as of the end of 2018, we had launched it in our South Korea, Americas/Pacific and Japan segments; Taiwan; and most of the markets in our Southeast Asia segment. Mainland China operates under a different business model and is not impacted by these changes.\nGlobal Direct Selling Channel\nOutside of Mainland China, individuals can elect to participate in our business as follows:\n\u2022\n\u201cDistributor-Direct Consumers\u201d-Individuals who purchase products directly from an independent distributor at a price established by the distributor.\n\u2022\n\u201cCompany-Direct Consumers\u201d-Individuals who purchase products directly from the company. These consumers are typically referred by a distributor and may purchase at a discount. These individuals do not have the right to build a Nu Skin business by reselling product or by recruiting others.\n\u2022\n\u201cBasic Distributors\u201d-Distributors who purchase products for personal or family use or for resale to other consumers. These individuals are not eligible to receive compensation on a multi-level basis unless they elect to qualify as a Sales Leader under our global sales compensation plan. We consider these individuals to be part of our consumer group, as we believe a significant majority of these distributors are purchasing products for personal use and not actively recruiting others, and their purchasing levels are similar to our \u201cCompany-Direct Consumers.\u201d\n\u2022\n\u201cSales Leaders and Qualifiers\u201d-Distributors who have qualified or are trying to qualify as a Sales Leader. These distributors have elected to pursue the business opportunity as a Sales Leader and are actively recruiting consumers and distributors and building a sales network under our global sales compensation plan and constitute our sales network.\nTo become a distributor, an individual signs a distributor agreement and receives a business portfolio, which is free in most markets and in some cases is delivered in electronic form. In some markets, we charge a small fee for the business portfolio, which is limited to our costs. The business portfolio generally consists of documentation concerning the business, including copies of the sales compensation plan, distributor policies and procedures, product catalog and other documentation, but does not include products. There are no requirements to purchase products or other materials to become a distributor, and no commissions are paid on any purchase of a business portfolio.\nWe offer a generous product return policy, which also includes returns of business support materials. In most markets, we offer a return policy that allows our distributors to return unopened and unused items for up to 30 days for a full refund, or 12 months subject to a 10% restocking fee. Distributors are not required to terminate their distributorship to return product. Actual returns have historically been less than 5% of annual revenue. We believe our generous return policy minimizes the financial risks associated with being a distributor.\nIn addition to our product return policy, we strive to be as customer protective as possible. We seek to ensure that those who use our products or participate in our business opportunity are treated fairly and are not misled by inappropriate product or earnings claims.\nThere are two fundamental ways in which our distributors can earn money:\n\u2022\nby reselling products purchased from the company to consumers; and\n\u2022\nthrough sales compensation earned on the sale of products under our global sales compensation plan.\nWe believe that our global sales compensation plan, which has been implemented in each of our markets except Mainland China, is among the most generous in the direct selling industry and is one of our competitive advantages. Our Sales Leaders can receive sales compensation under our global sales compensation plan for product sales from the company to their own network of consumers as well as for product sales from the company to other Sales Leaders and their consumer groups. This type of sales compensation is often referred to as \u201cmulti-level\u201d compensation. Our sales force is not required to recruit or sponsor others, and we do not pay any sales compensation for recruiting or sponsoring. While all of our distributors can sponsor others at any time, our Sales Leaders and those in qualification to become Sales Leaders are those who generally are actively sponsoring others. Pursuant to our global sales compensation plan, we pay consolidated sales\ncompensation in a Sales Leader's home country, in local currency, for product sales in the Sales Leader\u2019s own consumer group and for product sales in the Sales Leader\u2019s team of Sales Leaders across all geographic markets.\nMainland China Business Model\nBecause of restrictions on direct selling and multi-level commissions in Mainland China, we have implemented a business model for that market that is different from the business model we use in our other markets. We have structured our business model in Mainland China based on several factors: the guidance we have received from government officials, our interpretation of applicable regulations, our understanding of the practices of other international direct selling companies operating in Mainland China, and our understanding as to how regulators are interpreting and enforcing the regulations.\nIn Mainland China, we utilize sales employees to sell products through our retail stores and website; independent direct sellers, who can sell away from our stores where we have obtained direct selling licenses and can also sell through our service centers or our website; and independent marketers, who are licensed business owners authorized to sell our products at their own approved premises or through our stores and website. We rely heavily on our ability to attract new consumers and promote repeat purchases through our sales employees, independent direct sellers and independent marketers, and to educate our sales force about our products, culture and policies through frequent training meetings.\nOur sales employees, independent direct sellers and independent marketers in Mainland China do not participate in our global sales compensation plan, but are instead compensated according to a separate compensation model established for Mainland China. Sales employees, independent direct sellers and independent marketers earn bonuses or commissions based on their product sales. In addition, sales employees receive a salary, and independent marketers receive a service fee, both of which are reviewed and adjusted quarterly.\nOperating in Mainland China entails certain risks and uncertainties to our business, as discussed further in Item 1. Business-\u201cRegulation\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors. We endeavor to mitigate these risks and uncertainties through various measures, including by seeking to understand and obey laws and regulations, training our employees and sales force, engaging in dialogue with government officials to better understand their goals and explain our plans, and cooperating in inquiries and other matters of interest to regulators. However, these efforts do not eliminate the significant risks associated with operating in Mainland China.\nOur global sales compensation plan and our Mainland China business model, including our related know-how, processes and systems, play a significant role in helping us to attract and incentivize our sales force. We have strategically developed and refined our global sales compensation plan and our Mainland China business model to distinguish the business opportunity that we offer from those of other companies and to seek to provide us with a competitive advantage.\nSales Incentives, Meetings, Recognition and Training\nAn important part of our distribution channel is motivating our Sales Leaders and recognizing their achievements. We hold regular meetings and events globally in order to recognize Sales Leaders who have achieved various levels of success in our business. These meetings also allow the company and key Sales Leaders to provide training to other Sales Leaders. We utilize a variety of sales incentives such as incentive trips to motivate Sales Leaders. In addition to rewarding performance, incentive trips provide Sales Leaders and the company opportunities to share best practices, generate alignment of Sales Leaders around key initiatives, and provide a high level of motivation and team building.\nProduct Launch Process\nWe use a variety of methods to launch our products, enabling us to tailor the launch process to the specific market and the specific product. Prior to making a key product generally available for purchase, we may do one or more introductory offerings of the product, such as a preview of the product to our Sales Leaders, a limited-time offer, or other product introduction or promotion. In some of these offerings, we may sell the product for a limited time, often in limited quantities, and then remove it from the market for a period of time before making it generally available for purchase. We refer to this entire process, beginning with the introductory offering through general availability of the product, as a product launch or our launch process.\nSales Leader previews, limited-time offers and other product introductions and promotions may generate significant activity and a high level of purchasing, which can result in a higher-than-normal increase in revenue during the quarter and can skew year-over-year and sequential comparisons. We believe our product launch process attracts new Customers and Sales Leaders to our business, increases consumer trial and provides us with important marketing and forecasting information about our products. Please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for more information on risks related to our product launch process.\nGEOGRAPHIC REGIONS\nWe currently sell and distribute our products in approximately 50 markets. We have divided our markets into seven segments: Mainland China; South Korea; Southeast Asia, which includes Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam; Americas/Pacific, which includes Australia, Canada, Latin America, New Caledonia, New Zealand and the United States; Japan; Hong Kong/Taiwan, which also includes Macau; and Europe, Middle East and Africa (\u201cEMEA\u201d), which includes several markets in Europe as well as Israel, Russia and South Africa. We also generate revenue in our Other category, which primarily consists of the manufacturing and product-packaging companies that we acquired during the first quarter of 2018. The following table sets forth the revenue for each of the segments and the Other category for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(U.S. dollars in millions)\nMainland China\n$\n886.5\n%\n$\n717.0\n%\n$\n610.4\n%\nAmericas/Pacific\n385.0\n342.4\n298.8\nSouth Korea\n373.4\n361.7\n413.7\nSoutheast Asia\n316.9\n268.6\n271.9\nJapan\n254.9\n256.1\n279.0\nHong Kong/Taiwan\n185.9\n166.7\n184.0\nEMEA\n182.4\n160.3\n147.3\nOther\n94.0\n6.3\n-\n2.7\n-\nTotal\n$\n2,679.0\n%\n$\n2,279.1\n%\n$\n2,207.8\n%\nAdditional comparative revenue and related financial information is presented in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report.\nREGULATION\nOur business is subject to various laws and regulations globally, particularly with respect to our direct selling business models and our product categories. In addition, as a United States entity operating through subsidiaries in foreign jurisdictions, we are subject to foreign exchange control, transfer pricing and customs laws that regulate the flow of funds between us and our subsidiaries and for product purchases, management services and contractual obligations, such as the payment of sales commissions.\nAs is the case with most companies in our industry, we receive inquiries from time to time from government regulatory authorities regarding the nature of our business and other issues, such as compliance with local direct selling, transfer pricing, customs, taxation, foreign exchange control, securities and other laws. Negative publicity related to government inquiries into our operations in the United States in the early 1990s, in South Korea in the late 1990s and in Mainland China in 2014 has negatively impacted our business.\nDirect Selling Regulations\nDirect selling is regulated by various national, state and local government agencies in the United States and foreign markets. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes, including \u201cpyramid\u201d schemes, which compensate participants primarily for recruiting additional participants without significant emphasis on product sales to consumers. The laws and regulations in our current markets generally:\n\u2022\nimpose requirements related to order cancellations, product returns, inventory buy-backs and cooling-off periods for our sales force and consumers;\n\u2022\nrequire us, or our sales force, to register with government agencies;\n\u2022\nimpose limits on the amount of sales compensation we can pay;\n\u2022\nimpose reporting requirements; and\n\u2022\nrequire that our sales force is compensated for sales of products and not for recruiting others.\nThe laws and regulations governing direct selling may be modified or reinterpreted from time to time, which may cause us to modify our sales compensation and business models. In almost all of our markets, regulations are subject to discretionary interpretation by regulators and judicial authorities. There\nis often ambiguity and uncertainty with respect to the state of direct selling and anti-pyramiding laws and regulations. In the United States, for example, federal law provides law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), broad latitude in policing unfair or deceptive trade practices, but does not provide a bright-line test for identifying a pyramid scheme. Several states have passed legislation that more clearly distinguishes between illegal pyramid schemes and legitimate multi-level marketing business models. Recent settlements between the FTC and other direct selling companies and guidance from the FTC have addressed inappropriate earnings and lifestyle claims and the importance of focusing on consumers. These developments have created a level of ambiguity as to the proper interpretation of the law and related court decisions. For example, in 2015, the FTC took aggressive actions against a multi-level marketing company, alleging an illegal business model and inappropriate earnings claims. We have taken additional steps to educate our distributors on proper earnings claims. If our distributors make improper claims, or if regulators determine we are making any improper claims, this could lead to an FTC investigation and could harm our business.\nIn 2016, the FTC entered into a settlement with another multi-level marketing company, requiring the company to modify its business model, including basing sales compensation and qualification only on sales to retail and preferred customers and on purchases by a distributor for personal consumption within allowable limits. Although this settlement does not represent judicial precedent or a new FTC rule, the FTC has indicated that the industry should look at this settlement, and the principles underlying its specific measures, for guidance. If the requirements in this settlement lead to new industry standards or new rules, our business could be impacted and we may need to amend our global sales compensation plan. With a majority of our revenue in the United States coming from sales to retail customers, preferred customers, and distributors who have never sponsored other distributors, we believe that we can demonstrate consumer demand for our products, but we continue to monitor developments to assess whether we should make any changes to our business or global sales compensation plan. If we are required to make changes or if the FTC seeks to enforce similar measures in the industry, either through rulemaking or an enforcement action against our company, our business could be harmed.\nThe regulatory environment in Mainland China is particularly complex and continues to evolve. Mainland China\u2019s direct selling and anti-pyramiding regulations contain various restrictions, including a prohibition on the payment of multi-level compensation. The regulations are subject to discretionary interpretation by state, provincial and local regulators as well as local customs and practices.\nRegulators continue to act cautiously as they monitor the development of direct selling in Mainland China. As of January 31, 2019, we have obtained direct selling licenses in 37 cities in 25 provinces and municipalities in Mainland China. To expand our direct selling model into additional provinces, we currently must obtain a series of approvals from the local Department of Commerce in such provinces, the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Commerce (our supervisory authority), as well as the Ministry of Commerce, PRC (\u201cMOFCOM\u201d), which is the national governmental authority overseeing direct selling. In the course of obtaining these approvals, the respective authorities under MOFCOM must also consult and seek opinions on our business operations from the Ministry of Public Security and the Administration for Market Regulation at both provincial and state levels.\nOur operations in Mainland China are subject to significant government and media scrutiny and investigations. At times, investigations and other regulatory actions have limited our ability to conduct business in Mainland China. For example, due to recent events involving healthcare-related product claims for products of other companies in our industry, there has been increased regulatory scrutiny of the healthcare market, including direct selling. During the first quarter of 2019, we received guidance to limit certain business meetings in most provinces on a temporary basis. This could negatively impact our results for the first quarter and future quarters. In addition, following a number of negative media stories published in January 2014, we received inquiries from various government regulators in Mainland China asking us to respond to a number of allegations relating to our business practices, products and business model. In response to this media scrutiny and government review, we voluntarily took a number of actions in Mainland China, including temporarily suspending our business meetings, temporarily suspending acceptance of applications for any new sales representatives, and extending our product refund and return policies. The adverse publicity and suspension of business meetings and acceptance of applications had a significant negative impact on our revenue and the number of Sales Leaders and Customers in the region. We face a risk that future investigations and other regulatory actions may result in fines, revocation of licenses or other significant sanctions.\nSeveral markets, including Mainland China, South Korea, Indonesia and Vietnam, impose limits on the amount of commissions we can pay to our sales force. For example, under regulations in Mainland China, direct selling companies may pay independent direct sellers in Mainland China up to a maximum 30% of the revenue they generate through their own sales of products to consumers. Additionally, in South Korea, local regulations limit sales compensation to 35% of our total revenue in South Korea. We have implemented various measures to comply with these limits, including adjusting the commissionable value of some of our products in this market.\nIn some markets, regulations applicable to the activities of our Sales Leaders may affect our business because we are, or regulators may assert that we are, responsible for our Sales Leaders\u2019 conduct. In these markets, regulators may request or require that we take steps to ensure that our Sales Leaders comply with local regulations. For example, in Japan, we have taken steps to comply with strict requirements regarding how distributors approach prospective customers. From time to time, we receive warnings from consumer centers in certain prefectures about the number of general inquiries and complaints about us and our distributors. As a result, we continually evaluate and enhance our distributor compliance, education and training efforts in Japan.\nOur sales force is required to comply with work authorization and other local legal requirements prior to working in a market. Some markets, including Mainland China and Vietnam, also prohibit or restrict participation of overseas personnel or foreigners in direct selling activities. We have implemented policies that are designed to comply with these regulations and inform our sales force regarding the types of activities that are not permitted. However, we cannot assure that actions of our sales force will not violate local laws or regulations or our policies.\nPlease refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for more information on regulatory and other risks associated with our business.\nProduct Regulations\nOur Nu Skin and Pharmanex products and related promotional and marketing activities are subject to extensive government regulation by numerous federal, state and local government agencies and authorities, including the United States Food and Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d), the FTC, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Department of Agriculture, United States and State Attorneys General and other state regulatory agencies in the United States, as well as the State Administration for Market Regulation in Mainland China, the Food and Drug Administration in Taiwan, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety in South Korea, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan and similar government agencies in all other markets in which we operate. In the United States, the FDA, in particular, regulates the formulation, manufacture and labeling of over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) drugs, cosmetics, dietary supplements, foods and medical devices such as those distributed by us.\nRegulation of Personal Care Products in the United States. Our personal care products are subject to various laws and regulations that regulate cosmetic and personal care products and set forth regulations that among other things determine whether a product can be marketed as a \u201ccosmetic\u201d or requires further approval as an OTC drug. In the United States, the regulation of cosmetic content and labeling is under the primary jurisdiction of the FDA. Cosmetics are not subject to pre-market approval by the FDA, but their ingredients and their label and labeling content are regulated by the FDA, and it is the burden of those who sell cosmetics to ensure that they are safe for use as directed and not adulterated or misbranded. The labeling of cosmetic products is subject to the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFDCA\u201d), the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act and other FDA regulations.\nThe FDCA defines cosmetics by their intended use, as \u201carticles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body . . . for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance.\u201d Among the products included in this definition are skin moisturizers, perfumes, lipsticks, fingernail polishes, eye and facial makeup preparations, shampoos, permanent waves, hair colors, toothpastes and deodorants, as well as material intended for use as a component of a cosmetic product. A product may be considered a drug if it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or is intended to affect the structure or any function of the body (\u201cstructure/function claims\u201d). A product\u2019s intended use can be inferred from marketing or product claims, and regulators may consider the marketing claims of our sales force. Structure/function claims are generally prohibited for cosmetic products as are disease prevention and treatment claims. The FDA prohibits certain ingredients from being included in cosmetic products. It is possible that cosmetic product ingredients now commonly in use that are the product of certain scientific advancements or production processes may be restricted or prohibited in the future as more is learned about such ingredients.\nIn recent years, the FDA has issued warning letters to many cosmetic companies alleging improper structure/function claims regarding their cosmetic products, including, for example, product claims regarding gene activity, cellular rejuvenation, and rebuilding collagen. Cosmetic companies confront difficulty in determining whether a claim would be considered by the FDA to be an improper structure/function claim. Given this difficulty, and our research and product development focus on the sources of aging and the influence of certain ingredients on gene expression, there is a risk that we could receive a warning letter, be required to modify our product claims or take other actions to satisfy the FDA if the FDA determines any of our marketing materials contain improper structure/function claims for our cosmetic products. In addition, plaintiffs' lawyers have filed class action lawsuits against some of our competitors after our competitors received these FDA warning letters. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to government actions or lawsuits, which could harm our business.\nCertain products, such as sunscreens and acne treatments, are classified as OTC drugs (and cosmetics, depending on claims) and have specific ingredient, labeling and manufacturing requirements. OTC drug products may be marketed if they conform to the requirements of an FDA-established OTC drug monograph that is applicable to that drug. Drug products not conforming to monograph requirements require an approved New Drug Application (\"NDA\") before marketing may begin. Under these provisions, if the agency were to find that a product or ingredient of one of our OTC drug products is not generally recognized as safe and effective or is not included in a final monograph that is applicable to one of our OTC drug products, we may be required to reformulate or cease marketing that product until it is the subject of an approved NDA or until the time, if ever, that the monograph is amended to include such product. The labeling of these products is subject to the requirements of the FDCA and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act and other FDA regulations.\nRegulation of Personal Care Products in Other Markets. The other markets in which we operate have similar regulations. In Mainland China, personal care products, other than devices, are placed into one of two categories, \u201cspecial-purpose cosmetics\u201d and \u201cnon-special-purpose cosmetics.\u201d Products in both categories require submission of formulas and other information with the health authorities, and certain products require human clinical studies. The product registration process for some categories of personal care products in Mainland China can be unpredictable and generally takes from 9 to 18 months to complete. However, in some cases, product registration in Mainland China has taken several years. In Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare regulates the sale and distribution of cosmetics and requires us to have an import business license and to register each personal care product imported into Japan. In Taiwan, all \u201cmedicated\u201d cosmetic products require registration. The sale of cosmetic products is regulated in the European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d) under the EU Cosmetics Directive, which requires a uniform application for foreign companies making personal care product sales. Similar regulations in any of our markets may limit our ability to import products or utilize key ingredients or technologies globally and may delay product launches while the registration and approval process is pending. Changing regulations may require us to stop selling, discontinue or reformulate and re-register products in order to sell those products.\nRegulation of Nutritional Products in the United States. Our Pharmanex dietary supplement products are also subject to applicable regulations of government agencies in the markets in which we operate. In the United States, we generally market our nutritional products as conventional foods or dietary supplements. The FDA has jurisdiction over this regulatory area. The FDA imposes specific requirements for the labels and labeling of food and dietary supplements, including the requirements of the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004, which mandates declaration of the presence of major food allergens. In addition, the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 contains requirements with regard to the sale and importation of food products in the United States.\nThe FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (\u201cFSMA\u201d), which was signed into law in 2011, also increased the FDA\u2019s authority with respect to food safety and is considered one of the most significant changes to the FDCA with respect to strengthening the U.S. food safety system in recent years. It enables the FDA to focus more on preventing food safety problems rather than primarily reacting to problems after they occur. The law also provides the FDA with new enforcement authorities designed to achieve higher rates of compliance with prevention- and risk-based food safety standards and to better respond to and contain problems when they do occur. The law also gives the FDA important new tools to hold imported foods to the same standards as domestic foods and directs the FDA to build an integrated national food safety system in partnership with state and local authorities. As the agency finalizes implementation and training of regulations pursuant to FSMA, there is likely to be increased regulatory scrutiny with respect to food and nutritional supplements, and such scrutiny is likely to continue.\nThe FDA regulates dietary supplements principally under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (\u201cDSHEA\u201d). DSHEA formally defines what may be sold as a dietary supplement, defines statements of nutritional support and the conditions under which they may lawfully be used, and includes provisions that permit the FDA to regulate manufacturing practices and labeling claims applicable to dietary supplements. Because the majority of our Pharmanex products are regulated under DSHEA, we are generally not required to obtain regulatory approval prior to introducing a dietary supplement into the United States market. Prior to marketing a product, we are obligated to notify the FDA of any structure/function claims that we intend to make about the product in any product-related materials.\nGenerally, under DSHEA, dietary ingredients that were on the market before October 15, 1994 may be used in dietary supplements without notifying the FDA. However, a \u201cnew\u201d dietary ingredient (i.e., a dietary ingredient that was not marketed in the U.S. before October 15, 1994) must be the subject of a new dietary ingredient notification submitted to the FDA unless the ingredient has been \u201cpresent in the food supply as an article used for food\u201d without having been \u201cchemically altered.\u201d The enforcement of the term \u201cchemically altered\u201d has been and continues to evolve within the FDA. As such, an ingredient that is deemed today not to be \u201cchemically altered\u201d may be viewed otherwise in the future, which could lead to our being required to reformulate or cease marketing the product until such time that we can find a suitable replacement. A new dietary ingredient notification must provide the FDA with evidence of a \u201chistory of use or other evidence of safety\u201d which establishes that use of the dietary ingredient \u201cwill reasonably be expected to be safe.\u201d A new dietary ingredient notification must be submitted to the FDA at least 75 days before the new dietary ingredient can be marketed. Under DSHEA, the FDA may seek to remove from the market any new dietary ingredient that the FDA determines to be unsafe. In addition, the FDA may also deem a dietary supplement an unapproved drug where the marketing claims made in connection with the sale or promotion of the product effectively place it in the drug category.\nRegulation of Nutritional Products Globally. In our foreign markets, nutritional supplements are generally regulated by similar government agencies, such as the Mainland China State Administration for Market Regulation, the South Korea Ministry of Food and Drug Safety; the Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare and the Taiwan Department of Health. We typically market our Pharmanex products in international markets as foods, health foods, dietary supplements, food supplements or other similar categorizations under applicable regulatory regimes. With few exceptions, in the event a product or ingredient is classified as a drug or pharmaceutical product in any market, we will generally not be able to distribute that product in that market through our distribution channel because of pre-market approvals and strict regulations applicable to drug and pharmaceutical products. Mainland China also has highly restrictive nutritional supplement product regulations. Products marketed as \u201chealth foods\u201d are subject to extensive laboratory and clinical analysis by government authorities, and the product registration process in Mainland China takes a minimum of two years and may be substantially longer. In some cases it has taken us four years or longer to obtain product registrations. We market both \u201chealth foods\u201d and \u201cgeneral foods\u201d in Mainland China. There is some risk associated with the common practice in Mainland China of marketing a product as a \u201cgeneral food\u201d while seeking \u201chealth food\u201d classification. If government officials feel the categorization of our products is inconsistent with product claims, form of delivery, ingredients or function, this could end or limit our ability to market such products in Mainland China in their current form. In addition, we are not permitted to market or sell \u201cgeneral foods\u201d through our direct sales channel in Mainland China and any efforts by our independent direct sellers to do so could result in negative publicity, fines and other government sanctions being imposed against us.\nThe markets in which we operate all have varied regulations that distinguish foods and nutritional supplements from \u201cpharmaceutical products.\u201d Because of the varied regulations, some products or ingredients that are recognized as a \u201cfood\u201d in certain markets may be treated as a \u201cpharmaceutical\u201d in other markets. In Japan, for example, if a specified ingredient is not listed as a \u201cfood\u201d by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, we must either modify the product to eliminate or substitute that ingredient, or petition the government to treat such ingredient as a food. We experience similar issues in our other markets. This is particularly a challenge in Europe, where regulations often still differ from member state to member state, despite EU regulations designed to harmonize the laws of EU member states. As a result, we must often modify the ingredients and/or the levels of ingredients in our products for certain markets, or create unique formulations for multiple markets. In some circumstances, the regulations in foreign markets may require us to obtain regulatory approval prior to introduction of a new product or limit our use of certain ingredients altogether.\nBecause of negative publicity associated with some adulterated or misbranded supplements, including pharmaceutical drugs marketed as dietary supplements, there has been an increased movement in the United States and other markets to expand the regulation of dietary supplements, which could lead to additional restrictions or requirements in the future. In general, the regulatory environment is becoming more complex with increasingly stricter regulations each year.\nManufacturing Process. In 2008, and as updated more recently under the regulations implementing the Food Safety Modernization Act, the FDA established regulations to require current \u201cgood manufacturing practices\u201d for dietary supplements and food products in the United States. The regulations ensure that dietary supplements and food products are produced in a quality manner, do not contain contaminants or impurities above pre-established levels, and are accurately labeled. The regulations include requirements for establishing quality control procedures for us and our vendors and suppliers, designing and constructing manufacturing plants, and testing ingredients and finished products throughout our supply chain. The regulations also include requirements for record keeping and handling consumer product complaints. If dietary supplements or food products contain contaminants or allergens or do not contain the type or quantity of dietary ingredient they are represented to contain, the FDA would consider those products to be adulterated or misbranded. Our business is subject to additional FDA regulations, such as new dietary ingredient regulations and adverse event reporting regulations that require us to document and track adverse events and report serious adverse events that involve hospitalization, permanent impairment or death associated with consumers\u2019 use of certain of our products. Compliance with these regulations has increased, and may further increase, the cost of manufacturing and selling certain of our products as we incur internal costs, oversee and inspect more aspects of third-party manufacturing and work with our vendors to assure they are in compliance and maintain accurate recordkeeping to establish controls. Failure to comply with good manufacturing practices could also result in product recalls.\nAdvertising and Product Claims. Most of our major markets also regulate advertising and product claims regarding the efficacy and quality of products and require adequate and reliable scientific substantiation of all claims. In most of our foreign markets, we are typically not able to make any \u201cmedicinal\u201d claims with respect to our Pharmanex products. In some cases, such regulations may limit our ability to inform consumers of some of the benefits our products offer.\nIn the United States, the FDA generally prohibits disease diagnosis, prevention and treatment claims when made for a dietary supplement. DSHEA, however, permits substantiated, truthful and non-misleading \u201cstatements of nutritional support\u201d to be included in labeling for dietary supplements without FDA pre-approval. Such statements may describe how a particular dietary ingredient affects the structure, function or general well-being of the body, or the mechanism of action by which a dietary ingredient may affect the structure, function or well-being of the body, but such statements may not state that a dietary supplement will reduce the risk or incidence of a disease unless such claim has been reviewed and approved by the FDA. In addition, the FDA permits companies to use FDA-approved full and qualified health claims for products containing specific ingredients that meet stated requirements.\nA company that uses a statement of nutritional support in labeling must possess evidence substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading. In 2004, the FDA issued guidance, paralleling an earlier guidance from the FTC, defining a manufacturer\u2019s obligations to substantiate structure/function claims. Such statements, when used in labeling, must also be submitted to the FDA no later than thirty days after first marketing the product with the statement that they possess the necessary evidence and must be accompanied by an FDA mandated label disclaimer that \u201cThis statement has not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.\u201d There can be no assurance, however, that the FDA or FTC will not determine that a particular statement of nutritional support that we want to use is an unacceptable disease claim or an unauthorized nutrient-disease relationship claim otherwise permitted with FDA approval as a \u201chealth claim\u201d or that such claims have competent and reliable scientific evidence. Such a determination might prevent the use of such a claim or result in additional FDA enforcement.\nWe are aware of media reports regarding dietary supplements, which call for the repeal or amendment of DSHEA. Individuals or groups that are opposed to supplements or question their safety or efficacy may attempt to use these media reports to propose legislation intended to amend or repeal DSHEA. Some of the legislative proposals may include variations on premarket approval, enhanced premarket safety or substantiation required and changing the definition of a \u201cdietary ingredient\u201d to remove either botanicals or selected classes of ingredients now treated as dietary ingredients.\nMost of the other markets in which we operate have not adopted legislation like DSHEA, and we may be subject to more restrictive limitations on the claims we can make about our products in these markets. For example, in Japan, our nutritional supplements are marketed as food products, which significantly limits our ability to make claims regarding these products. If marketing materials produced or used by us or our sales force globally make claims that exceed the scope of allowed claims for nutritional supplements, the FDA or other regulatory authorities could deem our products to be unapproved drugs. In Mainland China, we also face significant restrictions on our ability to make product claims regarding the efficacy of our products. In a series of articles in 2014, prominent media outlets in Mainland China questioned some of the product claims made by our sales people and the scientific basis of these claims. This resulted in significant negative media attention for us. Such attention could harm consumers\u2019 perception of our business and our products and could negatively impact the registration, licensing status and sales of our products.\nThe FTC, which exercises primary jurisdiction over the advertising of all of our products in the United States, has instituted enforcement actions against dietary supplement, food, and cosmetic companies for, among other things, deceptive advertising and lack of adequate scientific substantiation for claims. We also face limitations on our use of the scientific experts who have helped us develop and test some of our products. In the United States, for example, the FTC\u2019s Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising may restrict marketing to those results obtained by a \u201ctypical\u201d consumer and require disclosure of any material connections between an endorser and the company or products they are endorsing. In Mainland China, some media outlets have questioned the nature and extent of our connections with our Scientific Advisory Board and others who have helped in developing our scientific approach or testing our products. This negative publicity could harm consumers\u2019 perception of our business and our products, which could negatively impact our revenue. We cannot be sure that the FTC, or comparable foreign agencies, will not question our advertising or other operations in the future.\nIn recent years, the FTC has initiated numerous investigations of and actions against companies that sell dietary supplements and cosmetic products. The FTC has issued guidance to assist companies in understanding and complying with its substantiation requirement. The FTC may enforce compliance with the law in a variety of ways, both administratively and judicially, using compulsory process, cease and desist orders, and injunctions. FTC enforcement can result in consent decrees or orders requiring, among other things, injunctive provisions, corrective advertising, consumer redress, and such other relief as the agency deems necessary to protect the public. Violation of these consent decrees or orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties. No assurance can be given that the FTC will not question our advertising or other operations in the United States in the future. Any action in the future by the FTC could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products in the United States.\nIn connection with investigations that occurred in the early 1990s of certain alleged unsubstantiated product and earnings claims made by our distributors, we entered into a consent decree with the FTC and various agreements with state regulatory agencies. The consent decree requires us to, among other things, supplement our procedures to enforce our policies, not allow our distributors to make earnings representations without making certain average earnings disclosures and not allow our distributors to make unsubstantiated product claims. The FTC could initiate an enforcement action to the extent the FTC determines that our advertising or promotional practices are deceptive or contrary to the requirements of the consent decree.\nRegulation of Medical Devices. In 2014, our facial spa was cleared for marketing through the 510(k) process with the FDA as a medical device with cosmetic benefit. Medical devices are highly regulated by the FDA. Manufacturers of medical devices must register and list their products with the FDA annually, whether they are located domestically or overseas. Foreign jurisdictions may take note of the fact that we have registered a medical device in the U.S. and require us to register in their market as well. The FDA has broad regulatory powers in the areas of clinical testing, manufacturing and labeling of medical devices. Medical devices must be labeled in accordance with the FDA\u2019s general device labeling requirements and whatever particular label requirements the FDA may designate for that type of device.\nIn addition, medical device manufacturers must adhere to certain \u201cgood manufacturing practices\u201d in accordance with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, which regulates the manufacture of medical devices, prescribes record-keeping procedures and provides for the routine inspection of facilities for compliance with such regulations. If in connection with these inspections, the FDA believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures, it may issue observations that would necessitate prompt corrective action. If the FDA inspection observations are not addressed and/or corrective action taken in a timely manner and to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction, the FDA may issue a Warning Letter (which would similarly necessitate prompt corrective action) and/or proceed directly to other forms of enforcement action. Failure to respond timely to FDA inspection observations, a Warning Letter or other notice of noncompliance and to promptly come into compliance could result in the FDA bringing enforcement action against us, which could include the shutdown of our production facilities, denial of importation rights to the U.S. for products manufactured in overseas locations and criminal and civil fines.\nOur Pharmanex BioPhotonic Scanner, ageLOC LumiSpa and ageLOC Spa systems may be subject to the regulations of various health, consumer-protection and other government authorities around the world. These regulations vary from market to market and affect whether our products are required to be registered as medical devices, the claims that can be made with respect to these products, who can use them, and where they can be used. We have been required to register our ageLOC Spa systems as medical devices in a few markets. Under applicable direct selling regulations in Mainland China, our Pharmanex BioPhotonic Scanner, ageLOC LumiSpa and ageLOC Spa systems are registered as \u201chealth care equipment\u201d or \u201chousehold appliances.\u201d We have been subject to regulatory inquiries in the United States, Japan and other markets with respect to the status of the Pharmanex BioPhotonic Scanner as a non-medical device. Any determination that medical device clearance is required for one of our products, in a market where we currently market and sell such product as a cosmetic or non-medical device, could require us to expend significant time and resources in order to meet the additional stringent standards imposed on medical device companies or prevent us from marketing the product. Please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for more information on the regulatory risks associated with our Pharmanex BioPhotonic Scanner, ageLOC LumiSpa and ageLOC Spa systems.\nCOMPETITION\nDirect Selling\nWe compete with other direct selling organizations, some of which have a longer operating history, and greater visibility, name recognition and financial resources than we do. Leading global direct selling companies include Amway, Avon Products, Herbalife and Mary Kay. We also compete with local direct selling companies. For example, the leading direct selling companies in Mainland China are Infinitus, Perfect and Joymain. We compete with these companies to attract and retain our sales force and consumers based on the strength of our product offerings, sales compensation, multiple business opportunities, management and international operations.\nProducts\nThe markets for our Nu Skin and Pharmanex products are highly competitive. Our competitors include a broad array of marketers of personal care and nutritional products and pharmaceutical companies, many of which have longer operating histories and greater name recognition and financial resources than we do. We compete in these markets by emphasizing the innovation, value and premium quality of our products and the convenience of our distribution system.\nEMPLOYEES\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 4,900 full- and part-time employees worldwide. This does not include approximately 40,000 sales employees in our Mainland China operations. Although we have statutory employee representation obligations in certain markets, our employees are generally not represented by labor unions except where expressly required by law. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good, and we do not foresee a shortage in qualified personnel necessary to operate our business.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nOur website address is www.nuskin.com.

Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed by any of these risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, which should be considered together with the other items in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Item 1. Business and Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nAdverse publicity concerning our business, marketing plan, products or people could harm our business and reputation.\nGrowth in our sales force and consumers and our results of operations can be particularly impacted by adverse publicity regarding us, the nature of our direct selling business models, our products or the actions of our sales force and employees. Given the nature of our operations, lack of clarity on applicable legal requirements and standards, and our continuous need to recruit and retain consumers and members of our sales force, we are particularly vulnerable to adverse publicity. Specifically, we are susceptible to adverse publicity concerning:\n\u2022\nsuspicions about the legality and ethics of network marketing;\n\u2022\ncontinued media or regulatory scrutiny regarding our business and our business model in Mainland China;\n\u2022\nthe safety or effectiveness of ingredients in our or our competitors' products;\n\u2022\ninquiries, investigations, fines, legal actions, or mandatory or voluntary product recalls involving us, our competitors, our business models or our respective products;\n\u2022\nthe actions of our current or former sales force and employees, including any allegations that our sales force or employees have overstated or made false product claims or earnings representations, or engaged in unethical or illegal activity;\n\u2022\nmisperceptions about the types and magnitude of economic benefits offered at different levels of sales engagement in our business; and\n\u2022\npublic, governmental or media perceptions of the direct selling, nutritional supplement or personal care industries generally.\nIn addition, these issues have previously resulted in negative publicity and have harmed our business. Critics of our industry, short sellers and other individuals who want to pursue an agenda have in the past and may in the future utilize the Internet, the press and other means to publish criticisms of the industry, our company and our competitors, or make allegations regarding our business and operations, or the business and operations of our competitors. In some cases, such adverse publicity or allegations can lead to government and regulatory scrutiny. In Mainland China, we have recently seen increased adverse publicity regarding the direct selling and healthcare products industries. We or others in our industry may receive similar negative publicity or allegations in the future, and it may harm our business and reputation.\nOur operations in Mainland China are subject to significant government scrutiny, and we could be subject to fines or other penalties.\nOur operations in Mainland China are subject to significant regulatory scrutiny. The legal system in Mainland China provides government authorities broad latitude to conduct investigations and many Chinese regulations, including those governing our business, are subject to significant interpretation, which may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Because of significant government concerns in Mainland China regarding improper direct selling activities, government regulators closely scrutinize activities of direct selling companies and activities that resemble direct selling. The government in Mainland China continues to inspect and interview the direct selling industry on a regular basis, which has and may continue to increase regulatory scrutiny of the industry and our business. As a result of negative media coverage about the healthcare-related product claims made by a competitor in the direct selling industry in Mainland China, the government has recently increased its scrutiny of activities within the healthcare market, including direct selling. Government regulators frequently make inquiries into our business activities and investigate complaints from consumers and others regarding our business. Some of these inquiries and investigations in the past have resulted in the payment of fines by us or members of our sales force, interruption of sales activities at stores and warnings. We continuously face the risk of new regulatory inquiries and investigations, and any determination that our operations or activities, or the activities of our sales employees, independent direct sellers or independent marketers, are not in compliance with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines, extended interruptions of business, and termination of necessary licenses and permits, including our direct selling and other licenses, all of which could harm our business.\nWe work diligently to train our sales force in Mainland China on how our Mainland China business model differs from our global business model. However, Sales Leaders in Mainland China may attend regional and global events or interact with Sales Leaders from other markets. Because our global model varies significantly from our Mainland China business model, mistakes may be made as to how those working in Mainland China should promote the business in Mainland China. These mistakes by our sales force may lead to government reviews and investigations of our operations in Mainland China. For example, in January 2014, a series of articles was published in Mainland China containing a number of allegations, including, among other things, that our compensation practices violated Chinese regulations against pyramid and multi-level sales models, that our recruiting and training techniques were unlawful or inappropriate and that certain of our sales force in Mainland China failed to adequately follow and enforce our policies and regulations. As a result of these allegations, in 2014 Chinese regulators commenced a review of our business model and operations in Mainland China. For a further description of these matters, see \u201cWe may become involved in legal proceedings and other matters that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could adversely affect our financial results.\u201d In response to media scrutiny and this government review, we voluntarily took a number of actions in Mainland China, including temporarily suspending our business meetings, temporarily suspending acceptance of applications for any new sales representatives, and extending our product refund and return policies. The adverse publicity and suspension of business meetings and acceptance of applications had a significant negative impact on our revenue and the number of Sales Leaders and Customers in the region. Further media scrutiny, particularly any coming from media outlets with close connections to the government of Mainland China, could result in further regulatory scrutiny and investigations in Mainland China and could negatively impact our revenue, sales force and business in this market, including the interruption of sales activities, loss of licenses, and the imposition of fines, and any other adverse actions or events.\nIf direct selling regulations in Mainland China are modified, interpreted or enforced in a manner that results in negative changes to our business model or the imposition of a range of potential penalties, our business would be significantly negatively impacted.\nThe government of Mainland China has adopted direct selling and anti-pyramiding regulations that impose significant restrictions and limitations on businesses in our industry. Most notably, the regulations prohibit multi-level compensation, which is the basis of how we compensate our sales force outside of Mainland China. The regulations also prohibit overseas personnel from participating in direct selling in Mainland China. We have structured our business model in Mainland China based on several factors: the guidance we have received from government officials, our interpretation of applicable regulations, our understanding of the practices of other international direct selling companies operating in Mainland China, and our understanding as to how regulators are interpreting and enforcing the regulations. In Mainland China, we utilize sales employees to sell products through our retail stores and website; independent direct sellers, who can sell away from our stores where we have obtained direct selling licenses and can also sell through our service centers or our website; and independent marketers, who are licensed business owners authorized to sell our products at their own approved premises or through our stores and website. We generally compensate our Sales Leaders at a level that is competitive with other direct selling companies in the market and reflective of the compensation of our Sales Leaders globally. The nature of the political, regulatory and legal systems in Mainland China gives regulatory agencies at both the local and central levels of government broad discretion to interpret and enforce regulations as they deem appropriate to promote social order. We face a risk that regulators may change the way in which they currently interpret and enforce the direct selling regulations, or that such regulations may be modified.\nIf our business practices are deemed to be in violation of applicable regulations as they may be interpreted or enforced, in particular our use of the sales productivity of a Sales Leader and the sales representatives that such Sales Leader trains, manages and services in setting his/her salary on a quarterly basis, then we could be sanctioned and/or required to change our business model, either of which could significantly harm our business.\nOur ability to expand our business in Mainland China could be negatively impacted if we are unable to obtain additional necessary national and local government approvals in Mainland China.\nAs of January 31, 2019, we have obtained direct selling licenses in 37 cities in 25 provinces and municipalities in Mainland China. To expand our direct selling model into additional provinces, we currently must obtain a series of approvals from district, city, provincial and national government agencies with respect to each province in which we wish to expand. The process for obtaining the necessary government approvals to conduct direct selling continues to evolve and is lengthy, as we are required to work with a large number of provincial, city, district and national government authorities. The complexity of the approval process as well as the government's continued cautious approach as direct selling develops in Mainland China makes it difficult to predict the timeline for obtaining these approvals. Furthermore, any media or regulatory scrutiny of our business in Mainland China could increase the time and difficulty we may face in obtaining additional licenses. If media or regulatory scrutiny of our business in Mainland China results in significant delays in obtaining licenses elsewhere in Mainland China, or if the current processes for obtaining approvals are delayed further for any reason or are changed or interpreted differently than currently understood, our ability to receive direct selling licenses in Mainland China and our growth prospects in this market, could be negatively impacted.\nIf we are not able to register products for sale in Mainland China, our business could be harmed.\nWe face lengthy timelines with respect to product registrations in Mainland China. The process for obtaining product permits and licenses may require extended periods of time that may prevent us from launching new product initiatives in Mainland China on the same timelines as other markets around the world. For example, products marketed in Mainland China as \u201chealth foods\u201d are subject to extensive laboratory and clinical analysis by government authorities, and the product registration process in Mainland China takes a minimum of two years and may be substantially longer. If the recent media and government scrutiny of the healthcare industry results in more burdensome regulations related to product registration, we may have more difficulty getting new nutritional products registered for sale in Mainland China. We market both \"health foods\" and \"general foods\" in Mainland China. There is some risk associated with the common practice in Mainland China of marketing a product as a \"general food\" while seeking \"health food\" classification. If government officials feel the categorization of our products is inconsistent with product claims, form of delivery, ingredients or function, we could be prohibited or limited in marketing such products in Mainland China in their current form.\nAs we expand our direct selling channel, we face additional product marketing restrictions compared to our retail store channel. Under applicable direct selling regulations in Mainland China, we can only register products for direct selling if we manufacture them and if they fall within categories that are authorized for direct selling, such as cosmetics, cleaning supplies, health foods, healthcare devices, small kitchen utensils and household appliances. Products that are not categorized as direct selling products and products that are manufactured by third parties are prohibited from marketing or selling through our direct sales channel. If we cannot successfully manufacture our own direct selling products, we will not be able to sell these products through the direct sales channel. Any marketing and sale of non-direct selling products by our independent direct sellers could result in negative publicity, fines and other government sanctions being imposed against us.\nRecently enacted tariffs, other potential changes to tariff and import/export regulations, and ongoing trade disputes between the United States and other jurisdictions may have a negative effect on global economic conditions and our business, financial results and financial condition.\nThe United States has proposed and enacted additional tariffs on certain items. Further, there have been ongoing discussions and activities regarding changes to other U.S. trade policies and treaties. In response, a number of our markets, including Mainland China, have indicated that they may impose tariffs on U.S. imports, or have already implemented tariffs on U.S. imports, or they may take other measures in response to these U.S. actions. These developments may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and they may significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between Mainland China and the United States. Any of these factors could depress economic activity, create anti-American consumer sentiment, restrict our access to suppliers or customers and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any actions by foreign markets to implement further trade policy changes, including limiting foreign investment or trade, increasing regulatory scrutiny or taking other actions which impact U.S. companies\u2019 ability to obtain necessary licenses or approvals could negatively impact our business.\nTariff discussions between the U.S. and its trading partners are ongoing and fluid. Any additional tariffs are subject to a number of uncertainties as they are implemented, including future adjustments and changes to the products covered by additional tariffs and to the countries included or excluded from such tariffs. The ultimate reaction of other countries, and the individuals in each of these countries, and the impact of these tariffs or other actions on the United States, Mainland China, the global economy and our business, financial condition and results of operations, cannot be predicted at this time, nor can we predict the impact of any other developments with respect to global trade.\nInability of products and other initiatives to gain or maintain sales force and market acceptance could harm our business.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected if our products, business opportunities, and other initiatives do not generate sufficient enthusiasm and economic benefit to retain our existing consumers and sales force or to attract new consumers and people interested in joining our sales force. Potential factors affecting the attractiveness of our products, business opportunities, and other initiatives include, among other items, perceived product quality and value, product exclusivity or effectiveness, economic success in our business opportunity, adverse media attention or regulatory restrictions on claims.\nIn addition, our ability to develop and introduce new products could be impacted by, among other items, government regulations, the inability to attract and retain qualified research and development staff, the termination of third-party research and collaborative arrangements, intellectual property of competitors that may limit our ability to offer innovative products or that challenge our own intellectual property, or problems related to manufacturing or quality control, and difficulties in anticipating changes in consumer tastes and buying preferences. For example, in 2015, a limited-time offer of our\nageLOC Me customized skin care system in South Korea generated less revenue than we expected. In that offer, we bundled the ageLOC Me device with a 12-month product subscription commitment, which we believe may have muted initial sales and contributed to the lower-than-expected results. Our operating results could be adversely impacted if our products fail to gain or maintain sales force and market acceptance.\nIn addition, in our more mature markets, one of the challenges we face is keeping Sales Leaders with established businesses and high-income levels motivated and actively engaged in business building activities and in developing new Sales Leaders. We may also face challenges retaining our sales force as the population of our markets transitions to a new, millennial demographic, with its associated new and different dynamics of loyalty. Many millennials are particularly savvy with social sharing across multiple business opportunity platforms. There can be no assurance that our initiatives will continue to generate excitement among our sales force in the long term or that planned initiatives will be successful in maintaining sales force activity and productivity or in motivating Sales Leaders to remain engaged in business building and developing new Sales Leaders. Some initiatives may have unanticipated negative impacts on our sales force, particularly changes to our sales compensation plans. The introduction of a new product or key initiative can also negatively impact other product lines to the extent our Sales Leaders focus their efforts on the new product or initiative. In addition, if any of our products fails to gain acceptance, we could see an increase in product returns.\nChallenges to the form of our network marketing system could harm our business.\nWe may be subject to challenges by government regulators regarding the form of our network marketing system. Legal and regulatory requirements concerning the direct selling industry generally do not include \"bright line\" rules and are inherently fact-based and subject to interpretation. As a result, regulators and courts have discretion in their application of these laws and regulations, and the enforcement or interpretation of these laws and regulations by government agencies or courts can change.\nRecent settlements between the FTC and other direct selling companies and guidance from the FTC have addressed inappropriate earnings and lifestyle claims and the importance of focusing on consumers. These developments have created a level of ambiguity as to the proper interpretation of the law and related court decisions. Any adverse rulings or legal actions could impact our business if direct selling laws or anti-pyramid laws are interpreted more narrowly or in a manner that results in additional burdens or restrictions on direct selling companies. For example, in 2015, the FTC took aggressive actions against a multi-level marketing company, alleging an illegal business model and inappropriate earnings claims. We have taken additional steps to educate our distributors on proper earnings claims. If our distributors make improper claims, or if regulators determine we are making any improper claims, this could lead to an FTC investigation and could harm our business.\nIn 2016, the FTC entered into a settlement with another multi-level marketing company, requiring the company to modify its business model, including basing sales compensation and qualification only on sales to retail and preferred customers and on purchases by a distributor for personal consumption within allowable limits. Although this settlement does not represent judicial precedent or a new FTC rule, the FTC has indicated that the industry should look at this settlement, and the principles underlying its specific measures, for guidance. If the requirements in this settlement lead to new industry standards or new rules, our business could be impacted and we may need to amend our global sales compensation plan. With a majority of our revenue in the United States coming from sales to retail customers, preferred customers, and distributors who have never sponsored other distributors, we believe that we can demonstrate consumer demand for our products, but we continue to monitor developments to assess whether we should make any changes to our business or global sales compensation plan. If we are required to make changes or if the FTC seeks to enforce similar measures in the industry, either through rulemaking or an enforcement action against our company, our business could be harmed.\nFollowing an audit of our Vietnam business during 2017, regulators in Vietnam informed us that an account transfer fee that we charge to distributors who transfer their business to a different market may be viewed, with respect to distributors who transfer to Vietnam, as an illegal sign-up fee under Vietnam's anti-pyramid laws. The account transfer fee is approximately $25. We have held discussions with the Vietnam authorities about this matter. Consequences for violating Vietnam's anti-pyramid laws may include monetary penalties and revocation of our license to do business in Vietnam. Our Vietnam subsidiary's revenue represented 1.6% of our 2018 consolidated revenue.\nWe could also be subject to challenges by private parties in civil actions. We are aware of recent civil actions against some of our competitors in the United States, which have and may in the future result in significant settlements. Allegations by short sellers directed at us and our competitors regarding the legality of multi-level marketing in various markets and adverse media reports have also created intense public scrutiny of us and our industry. Our business has also been subject to formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities in the past regarding our business and our compliance with local laws and regulations. All of these actions and any future scrutiny of us or our industry could generate negative publicity or further regulatory actions that could result in fines, restrict our ability to conduct our business in our various markets, enter into new markets, motivate our sales force and attract consumers.\nForeign-currency fluctuations and inflation in foreign markets could impact our financial position and results of operations.\nIn 2018, approximately 88% of our sales occurred in markets outside of the United States in each market\u2019s respective local currency. We purchase inventory primarily in the United States in U.S. dollars. In preparing our financial statements, we translate revenue and expenses in our markets outside the United States from their local currencies into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates. If the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to local currencies, our reported revenue, gross profit and net income will likely be reduced. Foreign-currency fluctuations can also cause losses and gains resulting from translation of foreign-currency-denominated balances on our balance sheet.\nIn addition, high levels of inflation and currency devaluations in any of our markets could negatively impact our balance sheet and results of operations. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of non-U.S. dollar monetary assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in our net earnings. For example, during 2015 and 2014, we recorded $10.2 million and $46.3 million, respectively, of non-cash foreign-currency charges related to the devaluation of the Venezuela currency after Venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. During the third quarter of 2016, we ceased business operations in Venezuela. Argentina also was recently designated as a highly inflationary economy; accordingly, beginning with the third quarter of 2018, we began to apply highly inflationary accounting for our Argentina operations, which could result in additional foreign-currency charges. Other markets, including Ukraine, have experienced weakening currencies, and it is possible that this and other markets may be so designated in the future. Our Venezuela, Argentina and Ukraine subsidiaries\u2019 net sales revenue each represented less than 1.6% of consolidated net sales revenue during each of the periods ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nAlthough we may engage in transactions intended to reduce our exposure to foreign-currency fluctuations, there can be no assurance that these transactions will be effective. Complex global political and economic dynamics can affect exchange rate fluctuations. For example, significant foreign-currency fluctuations occurred as a result of the June 2016 referendum in the United Kingdom in which voters approved an exit from the European Union. Rules related to the 2017 U.S. tax reform legislation also could affect foreign-currency fluctuations. In addition, members of the current U.S. presidential administration have expressed antipathy toward some international trade agreements and have begun to implement or have suggested the implementation of tariffs, border taxes or other measures that could impact the level of trade between the U.S. and other markets. Any such proposal or measure could impact the value of the U.S. dollar. It is difficult to predict future fluctuations and the effect these fluctuations may have upon future reported results or our overall financial condition.\nDifficult economic conditions could harm our business.\nGlobal economic conditions continue to be challenging. Difficult economic conditions could adversely affect our business by causing a decline in demand for our products, particularly if the economic conditions are prolonged or worsen. In addition, such economic conditions may adversely impact access to capital for us and our suppliers, may decrease the ability of our sales force and consumers to obtain or maintain credit cards, and may otherwise adversely impact our operations and overall financial condition. For example, certain economic indicators cause uncertainty regarding the potential for growth in the economies of the United States and Mainland China. Declines in economic conditions in these markets could negatively impact our business and revenue in these markets and in other markets globally.\nImproper sales force actions could harm our business.\nSales force activities that violate applicable laws or regulations could result in government or third-party actions against us, which could harm our business.\nFor example, in 2014, allegations were made by various media outlets that certain of our sales representatives in Mainland China failed to adequately follow and enforce our policies and regulations. In response to these and other allegations, Chinese regulators commenced a review of our business in Mainland China. In response to this media scrutiny and government review, we voluntarily took a number of actions in Mainland China, including temporarily suspending our business meetings, temporarily suspending acceptance of applications for any new sales representatives, and extending our product refund and return policies. The adverse publicity and suspension of business meetings and acceptance of applications had a significant negative impact on our revenue and the number of Sales Leaders and Customers in the region. Similar or more extreme actions by government agencies in Mainland China in the future could have a significant adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nThe direct selling industry in Japan continues to experience regulatory and media scrutiny, and other direct selling companies have been suspended from sponsoring activities in the past. Japan imposes strict requirements regarding how distributors approach prospective customers. From time to time, we receive warnings from consumer centers in certain prefectures about the number of general inquiries and complaints about us and our distributors. As a result, we continually evaluate and enhance our distributor compliance, education and training efforts in Japan. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts will successfully prevent regulatory actions against us, including fines, suspensions or other sanctions, or that the company and the direct selling industry will not receive further negative media attention, all of which could harm our business.\nExcept in Mainland China, members of our sales force are not employees and act independently of us. The most significant area of risk for such activities relates to improper product claims and claims regarding the business opportunity of joining our sales force. We implement strict policies and procedures to ensure our sales force complies with legal requirements. However, given the size of our sales force, we experience problems from time to time. For example, product claims made by some of our sales force in 1990 and 1991 led to a United States Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) investigation that resulted in our entering into a consent agreement with the FTC and various agreements with state regulatory agencies. In addition, rulings by the South Korean Federal Trade Commission and by judicial authorities against us and other companies in South Korea indicate that, if our sales force engages in criminal activity, we may be held liable or penalized for failure to supervise them adequately. Our sales force may attempt to anticipate which markets we will open in the future and begin marketing and sponsoring activities in markets where we are not qualified to conduct business. We could face fines, suspensions or other legal action if our sales force violates applicable laws and regulations, and our reputation and brand could be negatively impacted.\nWe have also seen an increase in the use of social media by our sales force to promote our business opportunity and products, which increases the burden on us to monitor compliance of such activities and increases the risk that such social media content could contain problematic claims in violation of our policies and applicable regulations. In addition, social media platforms could decide to block, or decrease the prominence of, our sales force\u2019s content for any reason, including if our sales force violates the social media platform\u2019s policies.\nIf our business practices or policies or the actions of our sales force are deemed to be in violation of applicable local regulations regarding foreigners, then we could be sanctioned and/or required to change our business model, which could significantly harm our business.\nOur sales force is required to comply with work authorization and other local legal requirements prior to working in a market. Some markets, including Mainland China and Vietnam, also prohibit or restrict participation of foreigners in direct selling activities. We have implemented policies that are designed to comply with these regulations and inform our sales force regarding the types of activities that are not permitted. However, we cannot assure that actions of our sales force will not violate local laws or regulations or our policies. If our business practices or policies or the actions of our sales force are deemed to be in violation of applicable regulations as they may be interpreted or enforced, then we could be sanctioned and/or required to change our business model, which could result in adverse publicity and significantly harm our business.\nIf we are unable to retain our existing sales force and recruit additional people to join our sales force, our revenue will not increase and may even decline.\nOur products are primarily marketed by our sales force and we depend on them to generate virtually all of our revenue. Our sales force may terminate their services at any time, and like most direct selling companies, we experience relatively high turnover among our sales force from year to year. People who join our company to purchase our products for personal consumption or for short-term income goals frequently only stay with us for a short time. Sales Leaders who have committed time and effort to build a sales organization will generally stay for longer periods. To increase our revenue, we must increase the number of and/or the productivity of our sales force.\nWe have experienced periodic fluctuations in both Sales Leaders and Customers in the past and could experience such fluctuations again in the future. Our ability to retain our Sales Leaders and Customers could be affected as our sales force makes increased use of social sharing channels, which may allow them to more easily engage their consumers and sales network in other opportunities. If our initiatives do not drive growth in both Sales Leaders and Customers, our operating results could be harmed. While we take many steps to help train, motivate and retain our sales force, we cannot accurately predict how the number and productivity of our sales force may fluctuate because we rely primarily upon our Sales Leaders to find new consumers, and to find, train and develop new Sales Leaders. Our operating results could be harmed if we and our Sales Leaders do not generate sufficient interest in our business and its products to retain and motivate our existing sales force and attract new people to join our sales force.\nThe number and productivity of our sales force could be negatively impacted by several additional factors, including:\n\u2022\nany adverse publicity regarding us, our products, our distribution channel, or our competitors;\n\u2022\nlack of interest in, dissatisfaction with, or the technical failure of, existing or new products;\n\u2022\nlack of compelling products or income opportunities, including through our sales compensation plans and other incentive trips and offerings;\n\u2022\nnegative sales force reaction to changes in our sales compensation plans;\n\u2022\nany negative public perception of our products and their ingredients;\n\u2022\nany negative public perception of our sales force and direct selling businesses in general;\n\u2022\nour actions to enforce our policies and procedures;\n\u2022\nany regulatory actions or charges against us or others in our industry;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and business conditions, including employment levels;\n\u2022\nrecruiting efforts of our competitors; and\n\u2022\npotential saturation or maturity levels in a given market, which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain our sales force in such market.\nThe loss of key Sales Leaders could negatively impact our growth and our revenue.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had a global network of approximately 1,244,000 Customers. Approximately 73,400 of our Customers were Sales Leaders. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 810 Sales Leaders occupied the highest level under our global sales compensation plan, and in Mainland China we have approximately 350 key Sales Leaders who play a significant role in managing, training and servicing our sales force in that market and driving sales. As a result, the loss of a high-level or key Sales Leader or a group of leading Sales Leaders, whether by their own choice or through disciplinary actions by us for violations of our policies and procedures, could negatively impact our growth and our revenue.\nOur business could be negatively impacted if we fail to execute our product launch process or ongoing product sales due to difficulty in forecasting or increased pressure on our supply chain, information systems and management.\nPrior to making a key product generally available for purchase, we may do one or more introductory offerings of the product, such as a preview of the product to our Sales Leaders, a limited-time offer, or other product introduction or promotion. These offerings may generate significant activity and a high level of purchasing, which can result in a higher-than-normal increase in revenue during the quarter and skew year-over-year and sequential comparisons. These offerings may also increase our product return rate. We may experience difficulty effectively managing growth associated with these offerings and may face increased risk of improper sales force activities and related government scrutiny.\nIn addition, the size and condensed schedule of these product offerings increase pressure on our supply chain and order processing systems. We have in the past, and may in the future, failed to appropriately scale our system capacity and operations in response to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products, which reduces our sales force\u2019s confidence in our business and could harm our reputation and profitability.\nAs our sales force increases its use of social platforms to interact with customers, our business results could be adversely affected if our implementation of new platforms and processes to support our sales force is delayed. In addition, we are dependent on third parties for testing and delivery of portions of these and other of our information system platforms. Unanticipated changes or system failures by third parties could harm our ability to meet the expectations of our sales force, thus resulting in harm to our revenue, reputation and sales force confidence in our systems.\nIf we are unable to accurately forecast sales levels in each market for product launches or ongoing product sales, obtain sufficient ingredients, components or packaging or produce a sufficient supply to meet demand, we may incur higher expedited shipping costs and we may temporarily run out of stock of certain products, which could negatively impact the enthusiasm of our sales force and consumers. Conversely, if demand does not meet our expectations for a product launch or ongoing product sales or if we change our planned launch strategies or initiatives, we could incur inventory write-downs. For example, in 2015 and 2014, we incurred inventory write-downs of $37.9 million and $50.0 million, respectively, which primarily resulted from reduced sales expectations primarily in our Greater China region. Any additional write-down of inventory in any of our markets would negatively impact our gross margins. If we fail to effectively forecast product demand in the product launch process or for ongoing product sales, our reputation and profitability could be negatively impacted.\nIf our ageLOC Spa systems, Pharmanex BioPhotonic Scanner or ageLOC LumiSpa are determined to be medical devices in a particular geographic market or if our sales force uses these products for medical purposes or makes improper medical claims, our ability to continue to market and distribute such devices could be harmed, and we could face legal or regulatory actions.\nOne of our strategies is to market unique and innovative products that allow our sales force to distinguish our products, including our ageLOC Spa systems, Pharmanex BioPhotonic Scanner or ageLOC LumiSpa. Any determination by regulatory authorities in our markets that these products must receive clearance or be registered as medical devices could restrict our ability to import or sell the product in such market until registration is obtained. While we have not been required to register our ageLOC Spa systems, Pharmanex BioPhotonic Scanner or ageLOC LumiSpa as medical devices in most of our markets, we have registered our ageLOC Spa systems as a medical device in Indonesia, Thailand and Colombia. In addition, we have received clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration to market our facial spa for over-the-counter use. There have been legislative proposals in the Philippines relating to the regulation of medical devices that could affect the way we market our ageLOC Spa systems, Pharmanex BioPhotonic Scanner and ageLOC LumiSpa in this market. In addition, if our sales force attempts to import or export products from one market to another in violation of our policy or is making medical claims regarding our products or using our products to perform medical diagnoses or other activities limited to licensed professionals or approved medical devices (in markets where the product is not approved), it could negatively impact our ability to market or sell these products and subject us to legal or regulatory actions. For example, in January 2016, our Taiwan subsidiary received a notification of charges alleging that certain of our employees and distributors in Taiwan inappropriately imported and sold ageLOC Body Spa devices in Taiwan in 2012 and 2011. Although we ultimately prevailed in this matter and were found by the court to be not guilty, we cannot provide assurance that we will prevail if other allegations related to our devices arise in the future.\nWhere necessary, obtaining medical device registrations and clearances could require us to provide documentation concerning product manufacturing and clinical utility, to make design, specification and manufacturing process modifications to meet standards imposed on medical device companies, and to modify our marketing claims regarding the registered product. While we successfully obtained clearance to market our facial spa for over-the-counter use in the United States, and registered our ageLOC Spa systems as a medical device in Indonesia, Thailand and Colombia, because medical device regulations vary widely from market to market, there can be no assurance we will not face challenges or delays in obtaining clearance in other markets, or that we will be able to make any required modifications or provide documentation necessary to obtain clearance. If we obtain such medical device clearance in order to sell a product in one market, such clearance may be used as precedent for requiring similar approval for the product in another market, or for similar products in the same market. These additional requirements could increase the cost associated with manufacturing and selling these products as non-medical devices in such markets.\nLaws and regulations may prohibit or severely restrict direct selling and cause our revenue and profitability to decline, and regulators could adopt new regulations that harm our business.\nVarious government agencies throughout the world regulate direct sales practices. Laws and regulations in Japan, South Korea and Mainland China are particularly stringent and subject to broad discretion in enforcement by regulators. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes, often referred to as \u201cpyramid schemes,\u201d that compensate participants primarily for recruiting additional participants without significant emphasis on product sales to consumers. The laws and regulations in our current markets often:\n\u2022\nimpose requirements related to sign-up, order cancellations, product returns, inventory buy-backs and cooling-off periods for our sales force and consumers;\n\u2022\nrequire us, or our sales force, to register with government agencies;\n\u2022\nimpose limits on the amount of sales compensation we can pay;\n\u2022\nimpose reporting requirements; and\n\u2022\nrequire that our sales force is compensated primarily for selling products and not for recruiting others.\nComplying with these widely varying and sometimes inconsistent rules and regulations can be difficult, time-consuming and expensive, and may require significant resources. The laws and regulations governing direct selling are modified from time to time, and, like other direct selling companies, we are subject from time to time to government inquiries and investigations in our various markets related to our direct selling activities. This can require us to make changes to our business model and aspects of our sales compensation plan in the markets impacted by such changes and investigations. In addition, markets where we currently do business could change their laws or regulations to prohibit direct selling. For example, Vietnam recently made significant changes to its direct selling laws and, as a result, is requiring all companies to renew their licenses. In the license-renewal process, government authorities may examine all aspects of our business practices and claims. Because all companies are required to obtain recertification, there has been a significant backlog and only a small number of companies received the new certification prior to the original deadline. The government has extended the deadline. If we are unable to obtain necessary licenses and certifications within required deadlines or continue business in existing markets or commence operations in new markets because of these laws, our revenue and profitability may decline.\nLimits on the amount of sales compensation we pay could inhibit our ability to attract and retain our sales force, negatively impact our revenue and cause regulatory risks.\nSeveral markets, including Mainland China, South Korea, Indonesia and Vietnam, impose limits on the amount of sales compensation we can pay to our sales force. For example, under regulations in Mainland China, direct selling companies may pay independent direct sellers in Mainland China up to a maximum 30% of the revenue they generate through their own sales of products to consumers. Additionally, in South Korea, local regulations limit sales compensation to 35% of our total revenue in South Korea. These regulations may limit the incentive for people to join our sales force and may reduce our ability to differentiate ourselves from our competitors in attracting and retaining our sales force.\nIn addition, we have been required to modify our sales compensation plan in certain markets, including South Korea, from time to time to remain in compliance with applicable sales compensation limits. Because sales compensation, as a percentage of revenue, can fluctuate as sales force productivity fluctuates, we may be required to make further changes to stay within applicable sales compensation limits or may be at risk of exceeding them. In addition, which revenues and expenses are within the scope of these regulations is not always clear, and interpretation and enforcement of these laws are subject to change, which could require us to make further changes or result in non-compliance with these regulations. Any failure to keep sales compensation within legal limits in Mainland China, South Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam or any other market that imposes a sales compensation limit could result in fines or other sanctions, including suspensions.\nGovernment regulations and private party actions relating to the marketing and advertising of our products and services may restrict, inhibit or delay our ability to sell our products and harm our business.\nGovernment authorities regulate advertising and product claims regarding the efficacy and benefits of our products. These regulatory authorities typically require adequate and reliable scientific substantiation to support any marketing claims. What constitutes such reliable scientific substantiation can vary widely from market to market and there is no assurance that the research and development efforts that we undertake to support our claims will be deemed adequate for any particular product or claim. If we are unable to show adequate and reliable scientific substantiation for our product claims, or our marketing materials or the marketing materials of our sales force make claims that exceed the scope of allowed claims for dietary supplements, cosmetics or devices that we offer, the FDA or other regulatory authorities could take enforcement action requiring us to revise our marketing materials, amend our claims or stop selling certain products, which could harm our business.\nFor example, in recent years, the U.S. FDA has issued warning letters to many cosmetic companies alleging improper structure/function claims regarding their cosmetic products, including, for example, product claims regarding gene activity, cellular rejuvenation, and rebuilding collagen. There is a degree of subjectivity in determining whether a claim is an improper structure/function claim. Given this subjectivity and our research and development focus on the sources of aging and the influence of certain ingredients on gene expression, there is a risk that we could receive a warning letter, be required to modify our product claims or take other actions to satisfy the FDA if the FDA determines any of our marketing materials include improper structure/function claims for our cosmetic products. In addition, plaintiffs' lawyers have filed class action lawsuits against some of our competitors after our competitors received these FDA warning letters. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to government actions or class action lawsuits, which could harm our business.\nIn 2009 in the United States, the FTC approved revisions to its Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising (\u201cGuides\u201d) that require disclosure of material connections between an endorser and the company they are endorsing and generally do not allow marketing using atypical results. Our sales force has historically used testimonials and \u201cbefore and after\u201d photos to market and sell some of our popular products such as our ageLOC Spa systems and ageLOC Transformation anti-aging skin care system. We intend to continue to use testimonials for our popular products, including weight management products. In highly regulated and scrutinized product categories such as weight management, if we or our sales force fails to comply with the Guides or makes improper product claims, the FTC could bring an enforcement action against us and we could be fined and/or forced to alter our marketing materials.\nRegulations governing the registration or pre-approval of our products could harm our business.\nOur products are subject to numerous domestic and foreign government agencies' and authorities' laws and extensive regulations governing the ingredients and products that may be marketed without pre-market approval and/or registration. Many of these laws and regulations involve a high level of subjectivity, are inherently fact-based and subject to interpretation, and vary significantly from market to market. These laws and regulations can also limit the claims we can make regarding our products and often restrict our ability to introduce products or ingredients into one or more markets.\nAt times these laws and regulations may delay or prevent us altogether from launching a product in a market, require us to reformulate a product or limit or amend the claims made regarding a product. If these laws and regulations further restrict, inhibit or delay our ability to introduce or market our products or limit the claims we are able to make regarding our products, our business may be harmed.\nFor example, in the United States, some legislators and industry critics have pushed for years to increase regulatory authority by the FDA over nutritional supplements. In 2011, the FDA proposed draft guidance to clarify the FDA's interpretation of the dietary ingredient notification requirements, and in August 2016, the FDA issued a revised draft guidance that superseded the 2011 version. This draft guidance is not yet final but appears to indicate that the FDA is expanding its definition of what is considered a \u201cnew dietary ingredient\u201d in the United States. The industry has worked with the FDA for several years, providing comments to the FDA to modify this guidance. While still in flux, if enacted in final form as proposed, this guidance could impose new and significant regulatory barriers for our nutritional supplement products or unique ingredients, which could delay or inhibit our ability to formulate, introduce and sell nutritional supplements as we have in the past.\nWe face similar pressures in our other markets, including Europe, which continue to set new limits on acceptable maximum levels of various vitamins and minerals, as well as on permitted ingredients and ingredient characterization, quality and levels. In Europe, for example, we are unable to market supplements that contain ingredients that were not marketed in Europe prior to May 1997 (\"novel foods\") without going through an extensive registration and pre-market approval process.\nSuch regulations in any given market can also limit our ability to import products and can delay product launches as we go through the registration and approval process for those products. Furthermore, if we fail to comply with these regulations, we could face enforcement action, and we could be fined or forced to alter or stop selling our products.\nThe FDA does not have a pre-market approval system for cosmetics. However, cosmetic products may become subject to more extensive regulation in the future. These events could interrupt the marketing and sale of our products, severely damage our brand reputation and image in the marketplace, increase the cost of our products, cause us to fail to meet customer expectations or cause us to be unable to deliver merchandise in sufficient quantities or of sufficient quality to our stores, any of which could result in lost sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows.\nNew regulations governing the formulation, introduction, marketing and sale of our products to consumers could harm our business.\nOur operations could be harmed if new laws or regulations are enacted that restrict our ability to market or distribute our products or impose additional burdens or requirements on us in order to continue selling our products. In addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations and enforcement of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketability of our products, resulting in significant loss of net sales.\nWe have observed a general increase in regulatory activity and activism in the United States and across many markets globally where we operate, and the regulatory landscape is becoming more complex with increasingly strict requirements. In particular, the requirements are impacting the ingredients we can include in our products, the accepted quantities of those ingredients and the quality and characterization of the ingredients. Global regulators have in recent years become overall more restrictive on the accepted levels of active ingredients that we can use in our product, in some cases banning them outright. They have also become more restrictive on permitted contaminant levels in ingredients and, in many cases, have forced complete removal of such contaminants. In certain cases, such as regarding some pesticides which are virtually ubiquitous in nature, it has proven difficult to comply with the requirements. Further, many of the restrictions regarding ingredient quality are not directly applicable to our products, leaving the possibility that our interpretation of compliance may not match that of the enforcing authorities. Often there is a lack of an equivalent active ingredient present in the marketplace. In other cases, the removal or reduction of a technical ingredient, such as various types of parabens, leads to a significant change to the character of the product that may make it no longer desirable or safe to the consumer. If this trend in new regulations continues, we may find it necessary to alter some of the ways we have traditionally marketed our products in order to stay in compliance with a changing regulatory landscape and this could add to the costs of our operations and/or have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on our business. Future changes could include requirements for the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, the recall or discontinuation of certain products that cannot be reformulated, additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling, and additional scientific substantiation. Any or all of these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur operations could be harmed if we fail to comply with Good Manufacturing Practices.\nAcross our markets, there are regulations on a diverse range of Good Manufacturing Practices that apply to us and to our vendors covering product categories such as dietary supplements, cosmetics, foods, over-the-counter drugs and medical devices. The Good Manufacturing Practices impose stringent requirements on a variety of topics, including vendor qualifications, ingredient identification, manufacturing controls and record keeping. Ingredient identification requirements, which often require us to confirm the levels, identity and potency of ingredients listed on our product labels within a narrow range, are particularly burdensome and difficult for us because our products contain many different ingredients. Additionally, certain Good Manufacturing Practices obligate us to track and periodically report adverse events to government agencies. Compliance with these increasing regulations may further increase the cost of manufacturing certain of our products as we work with our vendors to assure they are qualified and in compliance. In addition, our operations could be harmed if regulatory authorities determine that we or our vendors are not in compliance with these regulations or if public reporting of adverse events harms our reputation for quality and safety. A finding of noncompliance may result in administrative warnings, penalties or actions impacting our ability to continue selling certain products, including public withdrawals, seizures and recalls. For example, in prior years, we have had product recalls in the United States based on labeling issues. Problems associated with product recalls could be exacerbated due to the global nature of our business because a recall in one jurisdiction could lead to recalls in other jurisdictions. In addition, these risks associated with noncompliance could increase as we acquire businesses, including the businesses we acquired during the first quarter of 2018 and any businesses we may acquire in the future.\nThe loss of suppliers or shortages in ingredients could harm our business.\nWe and our supply chain acquire ingredients, components, products and packaging from third-party suppliers and manufacturers. A loss of any of these suppliers and any difficulties in finding or transitioning to alternative suppliers could harm our business. In addition, we obtain some of our products and ingredients from sole suppliers that own or control the product formulations, ingredients or other intellectual property rights associated with such products. We also license the right to distribute some of our products from third parties. In the event we are unable to renew these contracts, we may need to discontinue some products or develop substitute products, which could harm our revenue. In addition, if we experience supply shortages or regulatory impediments with respect to the raw materials, ingredients, components or packaging we use for our products, we may need to seek alternative supplies or suppliers and may experience difficulties in finding replacements that are comparable in quality and price. For example, some of our nutritional products, including g3 juice and ageLOC Youth (Youthspan or Y-Span in some markets), incorporate unique natural ingredients that are only harvested once a year and may have limited global supplies. If demand exceeds forecasts, we may have difficulties in obtaining additional supplies to meet the excess demand until the next growing season. If we are unable to successfully respond to such issues, our business could be harmed.\nProduction difficulties, quality control problems, inaccurate forecasting and reliance on third-party suppliers could harm our business.\nProduction difficulties, quality control problems, inaccurate forecasting and our reliance on third party suppliers to manufacture and deliver products that meet our specifications in a timely manner could harm our business. Occasionally, we have experienced production difficulties with respect to our products, including the availability of raw materials, components, packaging and products that do not meet our specifications and quality control standards. These production difficulties and quality problems have in the past, and could in the future, result in stock outages or shortages in our markets with respect to such products, harm our sales, or create inventory write-downs for unusable products.\nFor example, our ageLOC Me customized skin care system contains a large number of SKUs, and there is a degree of unpredictability in forecasting inventory needs globally due to the complexity and number of customized cartridges available. During the initial launch of ageLOC\nMe, we experienced production difficulties and a slightly higher return rate and complaint rate. Although these issues have been addressed, any future problems with ageLOC\nMe or our other products, including our ageLOC LumiSpa skin treatment and cleansing device, could lead to an increase in product returns or stock-outs and negatively impact our reputation, revenue and profitability.\nProduct diversion may have a negative impact on our business.\nWe see our products being sold through online marketplace sites and other distribution channels in certain markets. Although we continually take steps to control product diversion, including products sold in Mainland China, this activity continues to be a challenge, and we believe that changes to our global sales compensation plan or increased use of online channels for conducting sales transactions have and may continue to lead to increased product diversion. Product diversion causes confusion regarding our distribution channels and negatively impacts the ability of our sales force to sell our products. It also creates a negative impression regarding the viability of the business opportunity for our sales force, which can harm our ability to recruit new people to join our sales force. Product diversion schemes may also involve illegal importation, investment or other activities and harm our brand if gray market or counterfeit goods are passed off as our own. If we are unable to effectively address this issue or if diversion increases, our business could be harmed.\nChanges to our sales compensation plans could be viewed negatively by some of our sales force, could fail to achieve desired long-term results and have a negative impact on revenue.\nOur sales compensation includes some components that differ from market to market. We modify components of our sales compensation from time to time to keep our sales compensation plans competitive and attractive to our existing sales force and people interested in joining our sales force, to address changing market dynamics, to provide incentives to our sales force that we believe will help grow our business, to conform to local regulations and to address other business needs. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we began to implement significant changes to our global sales compensation plan, which we have now rolled out across most of our markets. Although we believe these changes have yielded positive results in many of our markets to date, they have not been viewed positively by some of our sales force, and it is difficult to predict the long-term impacts of these changes. Certain changes we made to our global sales compensation plan in the past, which were successful in several markets, did not achieve anticipated results in certain other markets and negatively impacted our business.\nAmong the recent changes to our global sales compensation program is a new bonus program for our sales force, funded in part by slightly increased prices for some of our products. These price increases could decrease consumer demand, causing the bonus program to result in higher selling expenses without a corresponding increase in revenue.\nIn addition, we have been required to modify our sales compensation plan in certain markets, including South Korea, from time to time to remain in compliance with applicable sales compensation limits. Changes to reduce sales compensation have had a negative impact on the sales force in the past and could in the future.\nWe may become involved in legal proceedings and other matters that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe have been, and may again become in the future, party to litigation, investigations, audits or other legal matters. For example, in 2014, we were named as a defendant in a purported class action complaint relating to negative media and regulatory scrutiny of our business in Mainland China and as a nominal defendant in a shareholder derivative suit relating to the same issues. Also, beginning in 2014, we were in discussions with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), which discussions were focused on a charitable donation we made in Mainland China in 2013 and issues related thereto. In April 2015, the SEC informed us that it was initiating a non-public, formal investigation into these issues. We also have been involved in two separate disputes with customs authorities in Japan with respect to customs assessments on several of our products. Although we settled the purported class action, shareholder derivative action and SEC investigation during 2016 and the Japan courts reached final decisions on the customs disputes in 2013 and 2018, these matters were, and any future matters that we may become involved in may be, expensive and time consuming. In general, litigation claims or other legal matters could result in settlements or damages that could significantly affect financial results. It is not possible to predict the final resolution of any litigation to which we may become party, and the impact of these matters on our business, results of operations and financial condition could be material.\nNon-compliance with anti-corruption laws could harm our business.\nOur international operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\"). Allegations that we are not in compliance with anti-corruption laws may require us to dedicate time and resources to an internal investigation of the allegations or may result in a government investigation. Any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with existing anti-corruption laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines and other penalties from U.S. or other regulatory entities, which have recently brought a number of enforcement actions against companies with extensive international operations. For example, in 2014, one of our competitors entered into a large settlement with U.S. regulators related to allegations that its employees violated the FCPA in Mainland China and other markets. Additionally, in September 2016, we reached a resolution with the SEC, in which the SEC found that our books and records and internal controls related to a charitable contribution in Mainland China in 2013 were insufficient, and we agreed to pay $765,688 to the SEC. In agreeing to this settlement, we neither admitted nor denied the SEC's findings. Although we have implemented additional anti-corruption policies, controls and training globally to prevent similar situations from arising in the future, we cannot be certain that these efforts will be effective or prevent future fines or penalties under the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws.\nOur ability to conduct business in international markets may be affected by political, legal, tax and regulatory risks.\nOur ability to capitalize on growth in new international markets and to maintain the current level of operations in our existing international markets is exposed to risks associated with our international operations, including:\n\u2022\nthe possibility that a government might ban or severely restrict our sales compensation and business models;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that local civil unrest, political instability or changes in diplomatic or trade relationships might disrupt our operations in an international market;\n\u2022\nthe lack of well-established or reliable legal systems in certain areas where we operate;\n\u2022\nthe presence of high inflation in the economies of international markets in which we operate;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that a government authority might impose legal, tax, customs, or other financial burdens on us or our sales force, due, for example, to the structure of our operations in various markets;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that a government authority might challenge the status of our sales force as independent contractors or impose employment or social taxes on our sales force; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility that governments may impose currency remittance restrictions limiting our ability to repatriate cash.\nWe depend on our key personnel, and the loss of the services provided by any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business and results of operations.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior and regional management, many of whom would be difficult to replace. Our senior and regional management employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time. In addition, we need to continue to attract and develop qualified management personnel to sustain growth in our markets. If we are not able to successfully retain existing personnel and identify, hire and integrate new personnel, our business and growth prospects could be harmed.\nGovernment authorities may question our tax or customs positions or change their laws in a manner that could increase our effective tax rate or otherwise harm our business.\nAs a U.S. company doing business globally, we are subject to all applicable tax and customs laws, including those relating to intercompany pricing regulations and transactions between our corporate entities in the jurisdictions in which we do business. Periodically, we are audited by tax and customs authorities around the world. If authorities challenge our tax or customs positions, including those regarding transfer pricing and customs valuation and classification, we may be subject to penalties, interest and payment of back taxes or customs duties. The tax and customs laws in each jurisdiction are continually changing and are further subject to interpretation by the local government agencies. We have experienced increased efforts by customs authorities in some markets to reclassify our products or otherwise increase the level of duties we pay on our products. Despite our best efforts to be aware of and comply with tax and customs laws, including changes to and interpretations thereof, there is a potential risk that the local authorities may argue that we are out of compliance. Such situations may require that we defend our positions and/or adjust our operating procedures in response to such changes. Any or all of these potential risks may increase our effective tax rate, increase our overall tax or customs expense or otherwise harm our business.\nWe may be held responsible for certain taxes or assessments relating to the activities of our sales force, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to the risk in some jurisdictions of being responsible for social security, withholding or other taxes with respect to payments to our sales force. In addition, authorities in some jurisdictions have challenged the \u201cindependent contractor\u201d status of distributors of some multi-level marketing companies, and they may continue to do so. In the event that local laws and regulations, or the interpretation of local laws and regulations, change to require us to treat members of our sales force as employees rather than independent contractors, or that our independent distributors are deemed by local regulatory authorities in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate to be our employees rather than independent contractors under existing laws and interpretations, we may be held responsible for a variety of obligations that are imposed upon employers relating to their employees, including social security, withholding and related taxes, minimum wage laws, and any related assessments and penalties, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. This risk increases as our sales force increases its use of social sharing, as several jurisdictions\u2019 regulations protect in-person or in-home sales demonstrations from creating an employment relationship but are less protective of online demonstrations. If our independent distributors were deemed to be employees rather than independent contractors, we would also face the risk of increased liability for their actions.\nWe could be subject to changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities, which could have a material and adverse impact on our operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, where a number of our subsidiaries are organized. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to change, with or without notice, due to economic, political and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for income taxes. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as intercompany transactions, changes in our business operations, acquisitions, entry into new markets, the amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have a lower statutory rate and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have a higher statutory rate, losses incurred in jurisdictions, the inability to realize tax benefits, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. In addition, a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, as the U.S. did with its tax reform legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTax Reform Act\u201d). Foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the Tax Reform Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and may materially affect our operating results and financial condition.\nThe Tax Reform Act made significant changes to the rules applicable to the taxation of corporations, such as reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The Tax Reform Act changes are complex and subject to additional guidance to be issued by the U.S. Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service. The Tax Reform Act requires complex computations that were not previously required by U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the Tax Reform Act and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. As future guidance is issued, we may make adjustments to amounts we have previously recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made. In addition, the individual states\u2019 reactions to the federal tax changes are evolving. As a result, the overall impact of the Tax Reform Act is uncertain. It is possible that the application of any new rules may have a material and adverse impact on our operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe are currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results, cash flows or financial condition in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions.\nThe loss of or a disruption in our manufacturing and distribution operations could adversely affect our business.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our principal properties consisted of our corporate headquarters and other office locations, distribution centers and warehouses, research and development centers, manufacturing facilities, retail stores and service centers located in many of our markets. Additionally, we also use third party manufacturers to manufacture many of our key products. As a company engaged in manufacturing, distribution and research and development on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental events, fires, strikes and other labor or industrial disputes, disruptions in logistics or information systems, loss or impairment of key manufacturing or distribution sites, import and export restrictions or delays, product quality control, safety, licensing requirements and other regulatory or government issues, as well as natural disasters, pandemics, border disputes, acts of terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control. For example, the earthquake and tsunami in 2011 disrupted our operations in Japan and negatively impacted our operating results. These risks may be heightened if we consolidate certain of our manufacturing, distribution or supply facilities or if we are unable to successfully enhance our disaster recovery planning. The loss of, or damage to, any of our facilities or centers, or that of our third-party manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDisruptions to transportation channels that we use to distribute our products to international warehouses may adversely affect our margins and profitability in those markets.\nWe may experience disruptions to the transportation channels used to distribute our products, including increased airport and shipping port congestion, a lack of transportation capacity, increased fuel expenses, import or export controls or delays, and labor disputes or shortages. Disruptions in our container shipments may result in increased costs, including the additional use of airfreight to meet demand. Congestion to ports can affect previously negotiated contracts with shipping companies, resulting in unexpected increases in shipping costs and reduction in our profitability.\nOur markets are intensely competitive and market conditions and the strengths of competitors may harm our business.\nThe markets for our products are intensely competitive. Our results of operations may be harmed by market conditions and competition in the future. Many competitors have much greater name recognition and financial resources than we have, which may give them a competitive advantage. For example, our Nu Skin products compete directly with branded, premium retail products and with the products of other direct selling companies. Because of regulatory restrictions concerning claims about the efficacy of personal care products and dietary supplements, we may have difficulty differentiating our products from our competitors\u2019 products, and competing products entering the personal care and nutritional market could harm our revenue. In addition, our business may be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately adapt to trends in consumer behavior and technologies.\nWe also compete with other direct selling companies to attract and retain our sales force and consumers. Some of these competitors have longer operating histories and greater visibility, name recognition and financial resources than we do. Some of our competitors have also adopted and could continue to adopt some of our successful business strategies, including our global sales compensation plan. Consequently, to successfully compete in this industry, and attract and retain our sales force and consumers, we must ensure that our business opportunities and sales compensation plans are financially rewarding. We believe we have significant competitive advantages, but we cannot assure that we will be able to continue to successfully compete in this industry.\nWe may incur product liability claims that could harm our business.\nWe sell a variety of different products for human consumption and use, including cosmetics, dietary supplements, conventional foods, OTC drugs and devices. Our cosmetics, dietary supplements and conventional foods are not generally subject to pre-market approval or registration processes so we cannot rely upon a government safety panel to qualify or approve our products for use, and some ingredients may not have long histories of human consumption or use. We rely upon published and unpublished safety information including clinical studies on ingredients used in our products and conduct our own clinical and safety studies on some key ingredients and products, but not all products. A product may be safe for the general population when consumed or used as directed but could cause an adverse reaction for some individuals, such as a person who has a health condition or allergies or who is taking a prescription medication. While we include what we believe are adequate instructions and warnings and we have historically had low numbers of reported reactions, previously unknown adverse reactions could occur. If we discover that our products are causing adverse reactions, or if we determine that any of our employees have not properly handled reports of adverse reactions, we could suffer further adverse publicity or government sanctions.\nAs a result of the type of products that we sell, we may be subject to various product liability claims, including that the products fail to meet quality or manufacturing specifications, contain contaminants, include inadequate instructions as to their proper use, include inadequate warnings concerning side effects and interactions with other substances or for persons with health conditions or allergies, or cause adverse reactions or side effects. Consumer protection laws and regulations governing our business continue to expand, and in some states such as California, class-action lawsuits based on increasingly novel theories of liability are expanding. Product liability claims could increase our costs, and adversely affect our business and financial results. As we continue to offer an increasing number of new products through larger scale, limited-time offers our product liability risk may increase.\nIf our sales force or employees provide improper or inappropriate advice regarding our products, their use or safety, we may be subject to additional product liability.\nWe have generally elected to self-insure our product liability risks. We continue to periodically evaluate whether we can and should obtain product liability insurance. Based upon our current approach to product liability risk management, if any of our products are found to cause any injury or damage or we become subject to product liability claims, we will be subject to the full amount of liability associated with any injuries or damages. This liability could be substantial and may exceed our existing reserves and harm our business.\nOur intellectual property may infringe on the rights of others, resulting in costly litigation.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States involving patents and other intellectual property rights. In particular, there has been an increase in the filing of suits alleging infringement of intellectual property rights, which pressure defendants into entering settlement arrangements quickly to dispose of such suits, regardless of their merit. Other companies or individuals may allege that we, or our sales force, consumers, licensees or other parties indemnified by us infringe on their intellectual property rights. Even if we believe that such claims are without merit, defending such intellectual property litigation can be costly, distract management\u2019s attention and resources, and the outcome is inherently uncertain. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products. Any of these results may adversely affect our financial condition.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our ability to compete could be negatively impacted.\nThe market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the value associated with our product innovations and our brand equity. We rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in other markets, and non-disclosure, confidentiality and other types of agreements with our employees, sales force, consumers, suppliers and other parties, to establish, maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights. Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or misappropriated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other competitive harm. In addition, the laws of certain foreign markets where we have significant business, including markets such as Mainland China, do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The costs required to protect our patents and trademarks may be substantial or even not practical. We have filed patent and trademark applications to protect our intellectual property rights in our new technologies, however, there can be no assurance that our patent and trademark applications will be approved and issue, that any patents and trademarks issued will adequately protect our intellectual property, or that such patents and trademarks will not be challenged by third parties or found by a judicial authority to be invalid or unenforceable. Moreover, many of our products rely on technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties on reasonable terms or at all.\nTo enforce and protect our intellectual property rights, we may initiate litigation against third parties, such as patent and trademark infringement suits or interference proceedings and seek indemnification by contract or otherwise. Any lawsuits that we initiate could be expensive, take significant time and divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, and we may ultimately fail to prevail or recover on any indemnification claim. Litigation also puts our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Additionally, we may provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially valuable. The occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our financial condition or diminish our investments in this area.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our products could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to patented technology, we rely on our unpatented proprietary technology, trade secrets, processes and know-how. Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or misappropriated. We generally seek to protect this information by confidentiality, non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and third parties. Our employees may leave to work for competitors. Our distributors or Sales Leaders may seek other opportunities. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may be disclosed to or otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. To the extent that our current or former employees, distributors, Sales Leaders, consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. If, for any of the above reasons, our intellectual property is disclosed or misappropriated, it would harm our ability to protect our rights and adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe may be subject to claims that we, or our employees, have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of our employees\u2019 former employers.\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed at other personal care product or nutritional supplement companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. To the extent that our employees are involved in research areas that are similar to those in which they were involved with their former employers, we may be subject to claims that such employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims.\nAny future acquisitions may expose us to additional risks.\nWe have recently acquired certain businesses, and we may continue to do so in the future as we encounter acquisition prospects that would complement our current product offerings, increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities. The financing for any of these acquisitions could dilute the interests of our stockholders, result in an increase in our indebtedness or both. Acquisitions may entail numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assimilating acquired operations or products, including the loss of key employees from acquired businesses and disruption to our direct selling channel;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u2022\nincreased fixed costs;\n\u2022\nadverse effects on existing business relationships with our suppliers, sales force or consumers; and\n\u2022\nrisks associated with entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience.\nOur failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business, or a failure to adjust our fixed costs quickly enough or sufficiently to adapt to rapidly changing market conditions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate acquisitions on favorable terms.\nA failure of our internal controls over financial reporting or our compliance efforts could harm our stock price and our financial and operating results or could result in fines or penalties.\nWe have implemented internal controls to help ensure the accuracy and completeness of our financial reporting and have implemented compliance policies and programs to help ensure that our employees and sales force comply with applicable laws and regulations. Our internal audit team regularly audits our internal controls and various aspects of our business and compliance program, and we regularly assess the effectiveness of our internal controls. There can be no assurance, however, that our internal or external assessments and audits will identify all significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls. If a material weakness results in a material misstatement of our financial results, we would be required to restate our financial statements. For example, for the first three quarters of 2014, our management concluded that we did not maintain effective controls over the presentation and disclosure of hyper-inflationary accounting for our Venezuela subsidiary. As a result of this material weakness, we decided to restate our consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of 2014.\nFrom time to time, we initiate further investigations into our business operations based on the results of our internal and external audits or on complaints, questions or allegations made by employees or other parties regarding our business practices and operations. In addition, our business and operations may be investigated by applicable government authorities. In the event any of these investigations identify material violations of applicable laws by our employees, sales force or affiliates, we could be subject to adverse publicity, fines, penalties or loss of licenses or permits.\nSystem failures, capacity constraints and other information technology difficulties could harm our business.\nWith global operations and a complex sales compensation plan, our business is highly dependent on efficiently functioning information technology systems, including websites, mobile applications, data centers, databases, networks and other systems. We rely on these systems for accepting and processing sales orders, operating our sales force and customer support operations, tracking and compensating our sales force, conducting our corporate and regional operations, and other aspects of our business. Accordingly, the performance, reliability and availability of our systems are critical to our business, reputation, and ability to attract and retain our sales force and customers.\nOur systems may be damaged or disrupted by fires, floods, earthquakes or other natural disasters, human error, telecommunications failures, power loss, physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, cyber attacks, changes in our information technology systems or organization, and other events. We have, and may in the future, experienced system failures and outages. We have adopted and implemented a Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery Plan under which our data is archived and stored at third-party secure sites, and we have recovery sites for certain critical data and operations. However, we cannot guarantee that these backup systems, security protocols, network protection mechanisms and other procedures currently in place, or that may be in place in the future, will be adequate to prevent or remedy system failure or interruption, data loss, security breaches or other data security incidents. Furthermore, any mitigation process could take several days or more, thus resulting in a loss of revenue, loss of confidence of our sales force and harm to our reputation.\nIn addition, we make significant expenditures on our information technology infrastructure and other technology initiatives, and these items could become obsolete or impaired. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we engaged a chief transformation officer, who was charged with reviewing and evaluating our information technology infrastructure and organization and our social sharing and digital initiatives. Following this review, we determined to alter our strategic direction with respect to some of our systems and tools, resulting in impairment charges of approximately $49 million. We also incurred approximately $22 million in severance payments and other expenses related to the reorganization of our Information Technology Department and other corporate and regional offices. In addition to these charges that we have already incurred, additional cash outlay and new personnel will also be necessary for execution of new plans and strategy, and we cannot provide assurance that these new plans and strategy will be successful.\nOur systems could also be strained by growth in our business. Although we work to expand and enhance our ecommerce features, network infrastructure and other technologies to accommodate increases in the volume of traffic to our ecommerce channels, we may be unsuccessful in these efforts. Our failure, or our suppliers\u2019 failure, to achieve or maintain system capacity could significantly reduce our ability to fulfill orders and could harm our business, reputation, revenue and financial condition.\nCyber security risks and the failure to maintain the integrity of company, employee, sales force or guest data could expose us to data loss, litigation, liability and harm to our reputation.\nWe collect, store and transmit large volumes of company, employee, sales force and guest data, including payment card information, personally identifiable information and other personal information, for business purposes, including for transactional and promotional purposes, and our various information technology systems enter, process, summarize and report such data. The integrity and protection of this data is critical to our business.\nWe are subject to significant security and privacy regulations, as well as requirements imposed by the payment card industry. For example, during 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation went into effect in the European Union, imposing increased data protection regulations, the violation of which could result in fines of up to 4% of our annual revenue. In addition, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which will, among other things, require covered companies to provide certain disclosures to California consumers and allow such consumers to opt-out of certain sharing of personal information when it goes into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA has already been amended, and it remains unclear whether it will be further amended or how it will be interpreted.\nIn the United States, congressional committees have recently held preliminary hearings about the advisability of a federal data privacy law, but it is uncertain whether the federal government will adopt such a law and whether it would preempt state data privacy laws. The prospect of new data privacy laws and ambiguity regarding the interpretation of existing laws has resulted in significant uncertainty and compliance costs. In addition to laws specifically governing privacy and data security, in some cases, federal and state regulators and state attorneys general and administrative agencies have interpreted more general consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. Although we monitor regulatory developments in this area, any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with these requirements could subject us to significant penalties, lawsuits and negative publicity and require changes to our business practices. In particular, maintaining compliance with these and other evolving regulations and requirements around the world often requires changes to our information system architecture and data storage processes. Making these changes is, and will likely continue to be, difficult and expensive. Investigations by the regulators of data security laws could also result in the payment of fines and harm our reputation. In 2017, our South Korea business was investigated by regulators in that market, and although the investigation did not result in significant fines, future investigations could result in significant fines or harm to our reputation. Private actions by affected individuals could also result in significant monetary or reputational damage.\nSimilarly, a failure to adhere to the payment card industry\u2019s data security standards could cause us to incur penalties from payment card associations, termination of our ability to accept credit or debit card payments, litigation and adverse publicity, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, a penetrated or compromised data system or the intentional, inadvertent or negligent release, misuse or disclosure of data could result in theft, loss or fraudulent or unlawful use of company, employee, sales force or guest data. Although we take measures to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of our data systems, we experience cyber attacks of varying degrees and types on a regular basis. Our infrastructure may be vulnerable to these attacks, and in some cases it could take time to discover them. Our security measures may also be breached due to employee error or malfeasance, system errors or otherwise. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, users, or customers to disclose sensitive information to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 or customers\u2019 data. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in the unauthorized disclosure, misuse or loss of sensitive information and lead to significant legal and financial exposure, regulatory inquiries or investigations, loss of confidence by our sales force, disruption of our operations and damage to our reputation. These risks are heightened as we work with third-party partners and as our sales force uses social media, as the partners and social media platforms could be vulnerable to the same types of breaches. Acquisition activity, which we have recently engaged in and which we may continue to engage in, may also heighten these risks, as the systems of the companies we acquire are not under our control prior to the acquisitions and it may take time to evaluate these systems and implement appropriate modifications to them.\nEpidemics and other crises could negatively impact our business.\nDue to the person-to-person nature of direct selling, our results of operations could be harmed if the fear of a communicable and rapidly spreading disease or other crises such as natural disasters result in travel restrictions or cause people to avoid group meetings or gatherings or interaction with other people. It is difficult to predict the impact on our business, if any, of the emergence of new epidemics or other crises. In addition, most of our Pharmanex nutritional supplement revenue is generated from products that are encapsulated in bovine- and/or porcine-sourced gel capsules. If we experience production difficulties, quality control problems or shortages in supply in connection with bovine or porcine related health concerns, this could result in additional risk of product shortages or write-downs of inventory. We may be unable to introduce our products in some markets if we are unable to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or if any product ingredients are prohibited, which could harm our business.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock is subject to significant fluctuations due to a number of factors that are beyond our control.\nOur Class A common stock closed at $51.88 per share on January 31, 2017 and closed at $65.65 per share on January 31, 2019. During this two-year period, our Class A common stock traded as low as $47.10 per share and as high as $88.68. per share. Many factors, including some we may be unable to control, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fall. Some of these factors include:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\ngovernment investigations of our business;\n\u2022\ntrends or adverse publicity related to our business, products, industry or competitors;\n\u2022\nthe sale of shares of Class A common stock by significant stockholders;\n\u2022\ndemand, and general trends in the market, for our products;\n\u2022\nacquisitions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\neconomic or currency exchange issues in markets in which we operate;\n\u2022\nchanges in estimates of our operating performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nspeculative trading, including short selling and options trading; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, business, regulatory and political conditions.\nBroad market fluctuations could also lower the market price of our Class A common stock regardless of our actual operating performance.\nSome of the markets in which we operate have currency controls in place, which may restrict our repatriation of cash.\nIf foreign governments restrict transfers of cash out of their country and control exchange rates, we may be limited as to the timing and amount of cash we can repatriate and may not be able to repatriate cash at beneficial exchange rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe typically fund the cash requirements of our operations in the U.S. through intercompany dividends, intercompany loans and intercompany charges for products, use of intangible property, and corporate services. However, some markets impose government-approval or other requirements for the repatriation of dividends. For example, in Mainland China, we are unable to repatriate cash from current operations in the form of dividends until we file the necessary statutory financial statements for the relevant period. As of December 31, 2018, we had $122.9 million in cash denominated in Chinese RMB. Currency exchange restrictions in Venezuela also impeded our Venezuela subsidiary\u2019s ability to obtain U.S. dollars to pay for imported products or to repatriate dividends to the United States. We ceased business operations in Venezuela in 2016.", "PERMNO": 84172, "SIC": 2844, "TIC": "NUS"}
