{"cik": "844161", "company": "CHEROKEE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-05-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\u2003RISK FACTORS\nThe occurrence of any of the risks and uncertainties and other factors described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report and the other documents we file with the SEC could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price, and could also cause our future business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price to differ materially from our historical results and the results contemplated by any forward-looking statements we may make herein, in any other document we file with the SEC, or in any press release or other written or oral statement we may make. You should carefully consider all of these risks and the other information in this Annual Report and the other documents we file with the SEC before making any investment decision with respect to our common stock. The risks described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report are not the only ones we face. Additional risks we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition and results of operations or cause our stock price to decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business is subject to intense competition.\nRoyalties paid to us under our licensing agreements are generally based on a percentage of our licensees\u2019 net sales of licensed products. Additionally, franchisees of our Flip Flop Shops brand pay us a percentage of their net sales. Merchandise bearing our Cherokee, Hi-Tec, Magnum, 50 Peaks, Interceptor, Hawk Signature, Tony Hawk, Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Flip Flop Shops, Everyday California, Carole Little, and Sideout brands, all of which are manufactured and sold by both domestic and international wholesalers and retail licensees, as well as merchandise sold by Flip Flop Shops retail shops, are subject to extensive competition by numerous domestic and foreign companies. Such competitors with respect to the Cherokee brand include Polo Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Liz Claiborne, and private label brands (developed by retailers) such as Faded Glory, Arizona, Merona, and Route 66. Factors that shape the competitive environment include quality of garment construction and design, brand name, style and color selection, price, fashion and other trends, avenue of purchase (including in stores and online), and the manufacturer\u2019s ability to respond quickly to the retailer on a national basis.\nOur business plan in the United States focuses on creating strategic alliances with major retailers for their sale of products bearing our brands through the licensing of our trademarks directly to retailers, engaging wholesalers to manufacture products bearing our brands and sell these products to retailers, and entering into franchise relationships with Flip Flop Shops retail store owners. Therefore, our degree of success is dependent on the strength of our brands, consumer acceptance of and desire for our brands, our licensees\u2019 ability to design, manufacture and sell products bearing our brands and our franchisees\u2019 ability to sell products bearing our or third-party brands, and the ability of our licensees and franchisees to respond to ever-changing consumer demands. Failures with respect to any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We cannot control the level of consumer acceptance of our brands and changing preferences and trends may lead customers to purchase other products. Further, we cannot control the level of resources that our licensees or franchisees commit to supporting our brands, and our licensees may choose to support products bearing other brands to the detriment of our brands because our agreements generally do not prevent our licensees from licensing or selling products of third parties, including our competitors. In addition, we compete with other companies owning established trademarks, which have entered into, and could continue to enter into, similar arrangements with retailers and wholesale manufacturers in the United States and internationally, including with our existing retail and wholesale partners, thereby competing with us for consumer attention, limited floor and rack space in the same stores in which our branded products are sold and time and resources of wholesale licensees that manufacture our products.\nWe are subject to risks related to the retail business that are applicable to our licensees and franchisees.\nThere are numerous risks and other factors applicable to the businesses of retailers (including our licensees and franchisees) that can impact the sale of products that bear our brands and, with respect to our franchisees, the sale of products bearing other brands from which we generate revenues. Any decline in sales by one or more of our licensees or franchisees could adversely affect our revenues.\nFactors that may adversely affect our licensees and franchisees and their sales of products include the following, among others: (i) weather, environmental or other conditions that may impact consumer shopping activity in retail stores; (ii) consumer preferences regarding fashion trends and styles, which can be region-dependent and subject to rapid and significant fluctuations; (iii) consumer preferences regarding where to shop; (iv) the growth of online shopping and the ability of our licensees and franchisees to market and sell products through these avenues; (v) changes in the availability or cost of capital in light of the financial condition and capital requirements of our licensees and franchisees; (vi) shifts in the seasonality of shopping patterns; (vii) fluctuating retail prices; (viii) the reputation of or general consumer perceptions about the retailers that sell our brands; (ix) labor strikes or other interruptions that impact supply chains and transport vendors; (x) the impact of excess retail capacity; (xi) changes in the cost of accepting various payment methods and changes in the rate of utilization of these payment methods; (xii) material acquisitions or dispositions; (xiii) investments in new business strategies; (xiv) the success or failure of significant new business ventures or technologies; (xv) actions taken or omitted to be taken by legislative, regulatory, judicial and other government authorities and officials; (xvi) security breaches; (xvii) natural disasters, the outbreak of war, acts of terrorism or other significant national or international events; and (xviii) the other risks discussed in this Item 1A.\nWe rely on the accuracy of our licensees\u2019 and franchisees\u2019 retail sales reports for reporting and collecting our revenues, and if these reports are untimely or incorrect, our revenues could be delayed or inaccurately reported or collected.\nMost of our revenues are generated from retailers who license our brands to manufacture and sell products bearing our brands in their stores and on their websites. In addition, we have a number of franchise agreements with franchisees of the Flip Flop Shops brand and we have arrangements with several wholesalers who license our brands to manufacture products bearing our brands and sell these products to retailers. Under our existing agreements, these licensees and franchisees pay us fees based in part on the value of products sold. We rely on our licensees and franchisees to accurately report the retail sales in collecting our license and franchise fees, preparing our financial reports, projections and budgets, and directing our sales and marketing efforts. All of our license and franchise agreements permit us to audit our licensees and franchisees. If any of our licensee or franchisee reports understate the retail sales of products they sell, we may not collect and recognize revenues to which we are entitled on a timely basis or at all, or may endure significant expense to obtain compliance.\nWe utilize various licensing and selling models in our operations, and our success is dependent on our ability to manage these different models.\nIn addition to our historical focus on our Direct to Retail licensing model, we recently commenced franchise operations with our acquisition of the Flip Flop Shops brand and we intend to grow this business in the future, and we also recently entered into several new licensing arrangements with wholesalers and may seek to enter into additional wholesale arrangements in the future. Even though our pursuits of these wholesale and franchise models may diversify our sources of revenue, these models could themselves be unsuccessful and could divert management\u2019s attention and other resources, including time and capital, from our historical focus on our Direct to Retail licensing strategy. As a result, our future success depends in part on our ability to successfully manage these multiple licensing and selling models.\nIf we are unable to manage our wholesale and franchise arrangements together with our Direct to Retail licensing model, then our financial condition and prospects would be harmed.\nOur business is dependent on the success of our Direct to Retail licensing model.\nAlthough we have recently commenced franchise operations and have pursued additional wholesale licensing arrangements, we have historically been focused on our Direct to Retail licensing model and it continues to be an important part of our operations. In Direct to Retail licensing, we grant retailers a license to use our trademarks on certain categories of merchandise. We believe the Direct to Retail licensing model has become more widely accepted by many retailers worldwide, and our business plan is based on the continued success of this model with our current licensees and with new retailers we may solicit to license our brands in new territories and additional product categories as we seek to expand this part of our business. However, our expectations regarding the Direct to Retail licensing model\nmay turn out to be wrong, and it may not grow as we anticipate. If our current or potential future retail licensees do not perceive our Direct to Retail licensing model to be advantageous to them, then they may move away from this model and instead embrace alternatives, such as purchasing from wholesalers or manufacturing private label products. Such a change in perception could occur for a variety of reasons, including reasons based on retailers\u2019 beliefs or expectations that may not turn out to be accurate.\nIf our Direct to Retail licensing model ceases to be attractive to retailers, then we would be unable to continue to pursue this aspect of our business plan and our financial condition and performance could suffer material adverse effects.\nOur business has historically been largely dependent on royalties from Target, which no longer sells Cherokee branded products.\nUntil January 31, 2017, Target had exclusive rights to Cherokee branded products for all product categories in the United States. Royalty revenues from Target\u2019s sales of Cherokee branded products accounted for greater than 35% of our total revenues during each of Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015. However, our license agreement with Target covering sales of most Cherokee branded products in the United States expired on January 31, 2017. Our license agreement with Target covering sales of Cherokee branded products in the school uniforms category will expire at the end of its current term on January 31, 2018, and will continue to generate revenues to us until its expiration.\nReplacing the royalty revenues received from Target for Cherokee branded products is a significant challenge, and we might not be successful in doing so. Even though we have entered into arrangements with wholesale licensees for sales of Cherokee branded products in the United States, which became operational at the beginning of Fiscal 2018, any increased revenues we may receive from these new wholesale licensees or any other licensees or franchisees may not be sufficient to offset the lost royalty revenues from Target. If we are not successful in replacing the Target\u2019s royalty revenues with equal or greater royalties from other partners the termination of this license agreement could have a material adverse effect upon our revenues and cash flows.\nWe acquired the Liz Lange brand in part based upon our expectation that revenues from Target for this brand would grow in future periods, although such revenue growth may never occur. Target has informed us that it has elected to not renew the Liz Lange license agreement, which expires on January 31, 2018 at the end of the current term, Target will continue to pay royalties to Cherokee Global Brands until the expiration of the agreement. Cherokee Global Brands has entered into a master license agreement with a third party for Liz Lange branded maternity products beginning in Fiscal 2019.\nOur wholesale licensing arrangements subject us to a number of risks.\nIn our wholesale licensing relationships, we license our brands to manufacturers that produce and import various categories of apparel, footwear, home products and accessories under our trademarks and sell the licensed products to retailers. We have some historical wholesale licensees with respect to some of our brands and we have recently entered into several new wholesale arrangements, primarily covering our newly acquired Hi-Tec and Magnum brands and sales of products bearing our Cherokee brand in the United States. We believe these arrangements signal a significant shift in our strategy for sales of products bearing the Cherokee brand in the United States, which in the past have been governed by a DTR license agreement. Although we believe these new wholesale licensing arrangements will help to diversify our sources of revenue and licensee or other partner relationships and will provide additional avenues to obtain brand recognition and grow our Company, these expectations could turn out to be wrong. If we do not achieve the intended or expected benefits of these wholesale arrangements, our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Moreover, we have less experience with the wholesale licensing model than the DTR licensing model and we may find it difficult to develop reliable forecasts and expectations regarding revenues from these arrangements, either of which could harm our business and our operating results.\nThe minimum annual royalty obligations under our wholesale license arrangements are significantly smaller than the minimum annual royalty obligations in some of our Direct to Retail licensing arrangements, including our former license agreement with Target and our license agreement with Kohl\u2019s. Also, our new wholesale license\nagreements for the Cherokee, Hi-Tec and Magnum brands are not subject to reducing royalty rates based on cumulative sales levels, as was our former license agreement with Target for the Cherokee brand. As we begin to recognize revenues from these new wholesale licensees and to the extent we pursue similar wholesale arrangements in the future, their lower minimum royalty obligations and consistent royalty rates could cause our performance and cash flows to be more strongly influenced by the seasonality of the retail business and thus subject to more material fluctuations between periods, and could also cause our aggregate annual royalty revenues to decline if retail sales volume for our brands decreases and we become dependent upon minimum royalty obligations.\nAdditionally, in wholesale arrangements, we have limited ability to control various aspects of the manufacturing process, including access to raw materials, the timing of delivery of finished products, the quality of finished products and manufacturing costs. Our wholesale licensees may not be able to produce finished products of the quality or in the quantities that are sufficient to meet retailer demand, in a timely manner or at all, which could result in an inability to generate revenue from any such products and loss of retailer confidence in our brands. On the other hand, wholesale licensees may produce inventory in excess of retailer and consumer demand, in which case over-supply may cause retail prices of products bearing our brands to decline. Additionally, there may be delays in the manufacturing process over which we may have no control, including shortages of raw materials, labor disputes, backlogs or insufficient devotion of resources to the manufacture of products bearing our brands. Further, we compete with other brand owners for the time and resources of our wholesale distributors, which could curtail or limit our ability to engage new or maintain relationships with existing wholesale licensee partners on acceptable terms or at all. Interruptions in the supply of products bearing our brands to retailers or lapses in quality could adversely impact our reputation and financial condition. Further, the unplanned loss of any of our wholesale licensees could lead to inadequate market coverage for retail sales of products bearing our brands, create negative impressions of us and our brands with retailers and consumers and add downward pressure on prices of products bearing our brands as a result of liquidating a former wholesaler\u2019s inventory of such products.\nRevenues from our Hawk Signature and Tony Hawk brands largely depend on Kohl\u2019s for Fiscal 2018.\nIn January 2014, we acquired the Hawk Signature and Tony Hawk brands. Concurrently with this acquisition, we entered into a retail license agreement with Kohl\u2019s, pursuant to which Kohl\u2019s is granted the exclusive right to sell Tony Hawk and Hawk-branded apparel and related products in the United States. We agreed to this exclusive license in part based upon our expectation that revenues from Kohl\u2019s for these brands will grow in future periods, although this expectation may turn out to be wrong and such revenue growth may never occur beyond the $4.6 million minimum annual royalty payment required under the license agreement, as amended.\nThe failure of our licensees or franchisees to sell products bearing our brands or that otherwise generate royalties to us, to pay us royalties for such products or to renew their license or franchise agreements with us could result in a decline in our results of operations.\nOur revenues are dependent on royalty payments made to us under our license and franchise agreements. Although the license agreements for our brands in many cases provide for guaranteed minimum royalty payments to us, the failure of our licensees or franchisees to satisfy their obligations under their agreements with us, their decision to not renew their agreements with us or their inability to grow or maintain their businesses could cause our revenues to suffer. Further, while we historically have been dependent on our relationships with Target and Kohl\u2019s, the concurrent failure by several of our other material licensees or franchisees to meet their financial obligations to us or to renew their respective license or franchise agreements could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition.\nOur acquisition of the Hi-Tec and Magnum brands and conversion of these brands to a new business model is subject to significant risks.\nWe acquired the Hi-Tec, Magnum and other associated footwear brands in December 2016. Before our acquisition, the Hi-Tec brands were operated under a full spectrum distribution model, meaning that one group of affiliated companies owned the brands and manufactured the products. In connection with our acquisition of these brands, we sold the associated operating assets to certain operating partners and/or distributors and entered into new\nwholesale licensing arrangements with these operating partners and/or distributors. Through these transactions and our post-acquisition integration efforts, we are converting the Hi-Tec brands to a branded licensing model. Going forward, we primarily intend to pursue a wholesale licensing model for these brands.\nThe acquisition of these brands and our conversion of their distribution model to align with our brand licensing model are subject to significant risks, as these brands have not historically been marketed, distributed and sold in this manner and it is uncertain whether this model will be effective for these brands. As a result, we are not able to reliably forecast or predict the impact of these brands on our revenues or other aspects of our results of operations. Further, the roles and responsibilities of the parties in the distribution chain for these products, including our Company, as the licensor of the brands and overseer of high-level marketing strategies, the wholesalers we engage to manufacture and distribute products bearing these brands, and the retailers to which the wholesalers sell these products for ultimate resale to consumers, will be different following our conversion of these brands to our brand licensing model. The wholesalers we have engaged for these brands to date, which consist of former operating partners and/or distributors of these brands, may not be familiar with or accustomed to our brand licensing model and may not be successful in converting their distribution efforts to align with this model. Further, as we make efforts to expand these brands to new geographic and consumer markets, we expect to pursue new arrangements with additional wholesale licensees for these brands. However, as with any effort to expand into new markets, any new wholesalers we may engage in the future for these brands, as well as the retailers and consumers they reach, may not be familiar with the brands and may not accept them. Any such outcome could result in failures to sell products bearing these brands in volumes and at prices that generate expected levels of revenue to us.\nAdditional risks associated with our acquisition of these brands include, among others, the following: (i) we expect our strategy for these brands to focus on wholesale licensing, and as a result, our efforts to build this brand will be subject to all of the risks associated with wholesale arrangements, including our dependence on third parties that we do not control, our lack of significant experience with wholesale arrangements and the other risks of wholesale licensing discussed elsewhere in these risk factors; (ii) the geographic scope of these brands is more significant than many of our other brands, and as a result, these operations will amplify the risks related to the international scope of our business, including less effective and less predictable protection and enforcement of our intellectual property in some jurisdictions and the other risks associated with our international operations discussed elsewhere in these risk factors; (iii) our conversion of the business model for these brands will require significant efforts, costs and other resources, which will divert attention from our other brands and could cause the performance of our other brands to suffer; and (iv) the acquisition of these brands has already involved significant time and costs, including the cash purchase price for the assets and our other expenses associated with the transaction, which has forced us to increase our debt levels and use significant amounts of cash on-hand and which puts significant pressure on our liquidity, particularly in light of the risks associated with our ability to manage and grow these brands under a new licensing model.\nIn light of the significance of the risks related to our acquisition of the Hi-Tec, Magnum and associated footwear brands and our efforts to convert their distribution model, we may fail to achieve the intended benefits of our acquisition of these brands and we may never generate sufficient royalty revenues from these brands to recoup their costs. If any of these outcomes were to occur, our performance, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.\nOur indirect product sales of products bearing the Hi-Tec and Magnum brands involve risks, including certain collection and credit risks and decreased comparability of our operating results.\nSince our acquisition of the Hi-Tec and Magnum brands in December 2016, we have been indirectly selling footwear bearing these brands to certain select wholesalers and government entities that are customers of these brands. In these relationships, the purchasers of the products place their product orders directly with us, which we then forward to a manufacturer for the manufacture and delivery of the products directly to the original purchaser. The wholesalers and government entities that purchase products under these arrangements submit payments directly to us for their product orders, the amount of which is typically determined based on a pre-established percentage mark-up to our cost, and we then pay the manufacturer of the purchased products for the cost of the order. As a result, we retain a percentage of the payments made to us by wholesalers and government entities. In Fiscal 2017, we recorded a total of $6.6 million in\nrevenues from these indirect product sales, of which a total of $5.1 million was paid to manufacturers or distributors as a cost of the product sales.\nDue to the payment structure for these arrangements, a significant portion of our revenues from indirect product sales is paid out to manufacturers as a cost of the product sales. Since the cost portion of these revenues, representing the product cost, are not retained by us, they are recorded as costs of goods sold in our consolidated financial statements and do not significantly increase our operating net income (loss). As a result, for as long as we maintain these indirect product sale arrangements, we may record increased revenues that do not materially increase our operating income (loss). The addition of indirect product sales to our business model, which has historically been exclusively focused on licensing and franchising relationships, could substantially reduce the comparability of our results of operations across periods and render such comparisons less meaningful.\nIn addition, although the product purchasers in these arrangements receive products directly from the manufacturer, which is similar to our wholesale licensing relationships, our indirect role in these product sales does not completely remove us from certain risks related to the manufacture and delivery of the products. For instance, since we are between the purchaser and the manufacturer in the product payment cycle, the wholesalers and government entities that purchase products under these arrangements may hold us financially responsible for product delivery failures or other similar events. Additionally, since these arrangements place us in direct contact, either through product order placement or receipt or payment of funds, with both the customer and the manufacturer of the products, we may be subject to increased credit risks based on these relationships. Moreover, serving as an intermediary between product customers and product manufacturers with respect to order placement and payment, and our role as such may expose us to additional risks of which we are not presently aware or we may not be able to effectively serve in this role. Further, although we intend to convert these indirect product sale arrangements to traditional direct or wholesale licensing relationships as the existing arrangements expire, the wholesalers and government entities with which we maintain these arrangements may not be amenable to a such a licensing relationship, in which case we could lose these customers or be required to maintain business relationships that would change our present business model. The occurrence of any of these risks could adversely affect our customer relationships and our performance.\nOur franchise business exposes us to numerous risks.\nIn connection with our acquisition of the Flip Flop Shops brand in October 2015, we acquired, and became the franchisor under, a number of franchise agreements with franchisees of this brand. Many of these franchisees maintain one or more Flip Flop Shops retail stores located across the globe, including in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean, the Middle East and South Africa. This new Flip Flop Shops franchise business exposes us to a variety of risks, including, among others, that: (i) we may not be able to find capable and experienced franchisees who can implement the Flip Flop Shops brand concept and strategies we believe are necessary for the future growth of this brand or sell merchandise and operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements; (ii) even if we are able to attract capable franchise owners, these franchisees may not be able to open new Flip Flop Shops retail stores in a timely manner or manage and maintain them once opened, secure desirable site locations, obtain adequate financing, construct and develop new store locations without delays and attract qualified operating personnel; (iii) the third party brands that are sold at Flip Flop Shops stores could decline in popularity or decide to stop selling their merchandise at some or all of the Flip Flop Shops store locations; (iv) neighborhood or economic conditions or other demographic patterns where existing or new Flip Flop Shops stores are located could decline or otherwise change in a negative way; and (v) our franchise business is subject to complex and varying franchise laws and regulations imposed by the U.S. federal, state and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, and we may need to devote significant costs and resources in order to learn and comply with these laws and regulations and we may be subject to various penalties, including monetary fines or other sanctions if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations. If any of these risks were to materialize, the reputation of the Flip Flop Shops brand or our other brands could be damaged, sales volume at one or more Flip Flop Shops store locations could decline, existing store locations may close or new may store locations may fail to open at expected rates or at all, the Flip Flop Shops brand name may not grow as we anticipate, or our franchise revenues relating to this brand could be limited, curtailed or reduced, any of which could harm our performance and prospects.\nOur business may be negatively impacted by general economic conditions.\nOur performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions and the corresponding impact on levels of consumer spending, which may affect our licensees\u2019 and franchisees\u2019 retail sales. It is difficult to predict future levels of consumer spending and any such predictions are inherently uncertain. Many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the apparel industries, including, among others, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, energy costs, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. Further, the worldwide apparel industry is heavily influenced by general economic cycles. Purchases of apparel, footwear and accessories tend to decline in periods of recession or uncertainty regarding future economic prospects, as disposable income typically declines. As a result, during periods of economic uncertainty, slowdown or recession, the risks associated with our business are generally more acute. For instance, general uncertainty in U.S. economic, political, regulatory, and market conditions has increased following the results of the 2016 U.S. presidential election due to the unpredictability of the policies and direction of the new administration, and these uncertainties may result in decreased confidence in the U.S. or global economy and decreased levels of consumer spending. In addition to decreased consumer spending generally, these periods of uncertainty, slowdown or recession may be accompanied by decreased demand for, or additional downward pricing pressure on, the products carrying our brands. Accordingly, any prolonged economic slowdown, a lengthy or severe recession or any other negative trend in either the U.S. or the global economy is likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects.\nWe are subject to additional risks associated with the international scope of our operations.\nMany of our licensees and franchisees are located outside the United States, as we franchise our Flip Flop Shops brand and market and license our other brands outside the United States. As a key component of our business strategy, we intend to expand our international sales as well as the support we provide our international licensees and franchisees. During Fiscal 2017, approximately 37% of our revenues were derived from our international licensees and franchisees. In addition, our business associated with our newly acquired Hi-Tec family of footwear brands is managed and operated by our Dutch subsidiary that we formed for the purpose of the acquisition.\nWe face numerous risks in doing business outside the United States, including, among others: (i) our general lack of experience operating foreign subsidiaries, (ii) unusual, unfamiliar or burdensome foreign laws or regulatory requirements, including tax, labor, contract, intellectual property protection and other laws, and unexpected changes to these laws or requirements; (iii) difficulties complying with the laws of multiple jurisdictions; (iv) uncertainties related to developing legal and regulatory systems and standards for economic and business activities, property ownership and the application of contract rights; (v) tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, trade embargos, and other trade barriers, about which there is increased uncertainty following the results of the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the trade policies of the new administration, including withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and proposed revision to the North American Free Trade Agreement; (vi) difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to conduct our foreign operations or manage our foreign licensees and franchisees; (vii) challenges relating to labor and employment matters, including differing employment practices and requirements regarding health, safety and other working conditions in foreign jurisdictions; (viii) competition from foreign companies; (ix) longer accounts receivable collection cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; (x) less effective and less predictable protection and enforcement of our intellectual property in some jurisdictions; (xi) changes in the political or economic condition of a specific country or region, particularly in emerging markets; (xii) potentially adverse tax consequences from the several U.S. and foreign jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation; and (xiii) cultural differences in the conduct of business. Any one or more of such factors could cause our future international sales to decline or could cause us to fail to execute on our business strategy involving international expansion. In addition, our business practices in international markets are subject to the requirements of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and applicable foreign anti-bribery laws, any violation of which could subject us to significant fines, criminal sanctions and other penalties.\nAdditionally, and because the majority of our international revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies of our international licensees\u2019 or franchisees\u2019 operations may negatively impact our royalty revenues. The main foreign currencies we encounter in our operations are the\nMexican Peso, the EURO, the Great British Pound, the South African Rand, the Japanese Yen, the Chinese Yuan, and the Canadian Dollar. We do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuations.\nWe have contracts with government entities that are subject to unique risks.\nWe have, and expect to maintain, long-term contracts with various foreign government entities, which primarily relate to our Hi-Tec family of footwear brands. In addition to normal business risks, including the other risks discussed in these risk factors, our contracts with government entities are often subject to unique risks, some of which are beyond our control. For instance, long-term government contracts and related orders are subject to cancellation if adequate appropriations for subsequent performance periods are not made. As a result, the termination of funding for a government program supporting any of our government contracts could result in a loss of anticipated future revenue attributable to that contract, which could have a negative impact on our operations. In periods of global or local political tension or unrest or decreased spending, these risks could be amplified. In addition, government entities with which we contract are often able to modify, curtail or terminate contracts with us at their convenience and without prior notice and would only be required to pay for work completed and commitments made at the time of termination. Any such modification, curtailment or termination of significant government contracts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business and the success of our products could be harmed if we are unable to maintain the strength of our brands.\nOur success to date has been due in large part to the strength of our brands. If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand, the strength of our brands may be impaired. Even if we react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences, consumers may consider one or more of our brands to be outdated or associate one or more of our brands with styles that are no longer popular. In the past, many apparel companies have experienced periods of rapid growth in sales and earnings followed by periods of declining sales and losses. Our business may be similarly affected in the future.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which could adversely affect our business and reputation and could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial results.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. As disclosed in Item 9A of this Annual Report, management has identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of these material weaknesses, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of January 28, 2017. This conclusion could cause investors to lose confidence in the reliability of our reported financial information, which could result in a significant decline in the market price of our common stock. Additionally, our reputation with lenders, retailers, investors, securities analysts and others may be adversely affected. Moreover, these effects could continue even after we have determined that the identified material weaknesses are remediated.\nAlthough we have developed and initiated a remediation plan designed to address the material weaknesses we have identified, this plan may not be fully implemented in a timely or effective manner, the remedial measures included in the plan will involve significant time and costs and will distract management from our core business operations, and these remedial measures could be insufficient to address the material weaknesses. In addition, even if we are successful in strengthening our controls and procedures, these controls and procedures may not be adequate in future periods and additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control could occur or be discovered. If any of these risks were to occur, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results. Any such restatement could lead to substantial additional costs for accounting and legal fees and litigation, significant reputational harm and material declines in our stock price.\nCompliance with changing securities laws, regulations and financial reporting standards could increase our costs and pose challenges for our management team, and any compliance failures could materially harm our business.\nExisting laws, regulations, listing requirements and other standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure significantly increase the costs and risks associated with operating as a publicly traded company in the United States. Our management team devotes significant time and financial resources to try to comply with existing and evolving standards for public companies. However, notwithstanding our efforts, we have failed to comply with the SEC\u2019s reporting deadlines applicable to this Annual Report, and it is possible that additional financial and other public reports we are obligated to file in the future also may not be considered timely, accurate or complete. In order to re-establish compliance with our public reporting requirements, we intend to hire additional personnel, engage consultants or other third-party advisors and change our internal practices, standards and policies, which could significantly increase our costs and divert management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities. In addition, noncompliance with these reporting requirements could subject us to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC, which could involve fines or other penalties, and could also adversely affect our financial results, result in a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial information and other public disclosures and jeopardize the listing of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, as described below. If any of these risks were to occur, our business and reputation could be materially adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could materially decline.\nFurther, the SEC has passed, promulgated or proposed new rules on a variety of subjects, including, for example, with respect to the preparation and filing of financial statements, establishment or disclosure of clawback and hedging policies and disclosure of executive compensation information. The existence of new and proposed laws and regulations relating to financial reporting or other disclosure obligations or that impose additional or more stringent compliance requirements could create uncertainties for public companies, make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified executive officers and members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our audit and compensation committees, and generate significantly increased costs if we are required to add additional accounting or other staff, engage consultants or change our internal practices in order to comply with the new requirements. The occurrence of any of these outcomes could significantly harm our business, financial condition and performance.\nWe are dependent on our intellectual property, and we may not be able to successfully protect our rights or we may become involved in costly legal proceedings regarding our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of third parties.\nWe hold various trademarks for our brands, including Cherokee, Hi-Tec, Magnum, 50 Peaks, Interceptor, Hawk Signature, Tony Hawk, Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Flip Flop Shops, Everyday California, Carole Little, Sideout and others in connection with apparel, footwear, home and accessories. These trademarks are vital to the success and future growth of our business. These trademarks are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and corresponding government agencies in numerous other countries and we also hold trademark applications for these brands in a number of other countries, although the laws of many countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and, as a result, adequate protection in these jurisdictions may be unavailable or limited. These actions taken by us to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights might not prevent imitation of our products, infringement of our intellectual property rights by unauthorized parties or other challenges to our intellectual property ownership, or prevent the loss of licensing or franchise revenue or other damages caused thereby, including a reduction in value of our licenses that could make it easier for competitors of our licensees to capture increased market share. If any of these events occurs, our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially harmed. In the future, we may be required to assert infringement claims against third parties, and one or more parties may assert infringement claims against us. Any resulting litigation could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our management personnel whether or not such litigation is determined in our favor. Further, if any adverse ruling in any such matter occurs, any resulting limitations in our ability to market or license our brands could reduce the value of our licenses and our intellectual property assets and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may become involved in other litigation or government or administrative proceedings that may materially affect us.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including commercial, employment, class action and other litigation and claims. We may also be the subject of government and other regulatory investigations, audits and proceedings, including in connection with any claim of our violation of the laws, rules and regulations applicable to our business, such as federal, state and foreign franchise laws, anti-bribery laws and work safety and labor laws, among others. Such matters can be time-consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant legal and other expenses. Furthermore, because litigation and administrative or government proceedings are inherently unpredictable, any of these proceedings could result in unfavorable outcomes, which could include monetary damages or fines and other sanctions. Any such result could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are dependent on our key management personnel.\nOur success is highly dependent upon the continued services of our key executives, consisting of Henry Stupp, our Chief Executive Officer and a member of our board of directors (\u201cBoard of Directors\u201d), Howard Siegel, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Jason Boling, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as certain of our other key employees, including Ed van Wezel, the Chief Executive Officer of our subsidiary that manages our Hi-Tec family of footwear brands, Martin Binnendijk, the President and Chief Operating Officer of our subsidiary that manages our Hi-Tec family of footwear brands, and Brian Curin, the President of our subsidiary that manages our Flip Flop Shops franchise operations. We have a limited number of employees, and Mr. Stupp\u2019s and our other executives\u2019 leadership and experience in the apparel licensing industry, Mr. Curin\u2019s expertise in the franchising industry, and Messrs. van Wezel\u2019s and Binnendijk\u2019s experience with our newly acquired Hi-Tec family of footwear brands are important to the successful implementation of our business and marketing strategy. We do not carry key person life insurance covering any of our executives or other employees. The loss of the services of Mr. Stupp or our other executives or key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe may encounter difficulties in connection with acquisitions or other strategic transactions and we may not realize the expected benefits from these transactions.\nWe regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire or represent new brands. During our three most recently completed fiscal years, we have completed three such acquisitions: our acquisition of the Everyday California Lifestyle brand in May 2015; our acquisition of the Flip Flop Shops brand in October 2015; and our acquisition of the Hi-Tec and Magnum brands in December 2016. We expect to continue to consider opportunities to acquire or make investments in other brands or to engage in other strategic transactions that could enhance our portfolio of products and services or expand the breadth of our markets. Our experience integrating acquired assets and businesses is limited, and we may not be successful in realizing the expected benefits from an acquisition. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage an expanded portfolio of brands, which could involve significantly increased costs and pose substantial challenges for management.\nAcquisitions and other strategic transactions can involve numerous risks and potential difficulties, including, among others: (i) problems assimilating new brands or other assets; (ii) problems maintaining and enforcing standards, procedures, controls, policies and information systems; (iii) difficulties and costs in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel, including any failure to retain key employees, customers, vendors, manufacturers or other service providers or partners of any acquired businesses, any failure to convert and integrate acquired assets into our branded licensing business model, and challenges forecasting revenues and expenses for newly acquired brands; (iv) significant or unanticipated costs associated with an acquisition, including incurrence of contingent liabilities, amortization charges associated with acquired assets, wirte-offs of goodwill or trademarks, capital expenditures and accounting, legal and other transaction expenses; (v) any inability to realize the intended synergies and other benefits of an acquisition or transaction, particularly if our assumptions about sales, revenues, operating expenses and costs of acquired assets or businesses turn out to be wrong; (vi) diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business or our existing brand portfolio; (vii) adverse effects on existing business relationships with our partners; (viii) risks associated with foreign acquisitions or otherwise entering new geographic or\ncustomer markets, such as our acquisition of the Hi-Tec and Magnum brands in December 2016, including regional differences in consumer preferences, branding standards and the general conduct of business, less effective and less predictable protection and enforcement of intellectual property in some foreign jurisdictions and other risks related to doing business outside the United States; and (ix) risks associated with new types of business arrangements in which we have no or limited prior experience, such as our acquisition of franchise agreements and entry into the franchising business upon our acquisition of the Flip Flop Shops brand in October 2015. Accordingly, our recent acquisitions as well as any future transactions that we pursue may not result in the anticipated benefits and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIn addition, future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available when needed, on favorable terms or at all. If we seek to finance future acquisitions or other strategic transactions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities or by incurring other types of indebtedness, we may experience the risks associated with these transactions that are described in these risk factors below. Further, we may seek such financing from sources that expose us to additional risks, such as our receivables funding loan agreement entered into with one of our directors, Mr. Jess Ravich, in December 2016 in connection with our acquisition of the Hi-Tec and Magnum brands, which creates a conflict of interest between us and Mr. Ravich that could have negative effects. Any of these effects could harm our operating results or financial condition.\nWe have incurred a significant amount of indebtedness to pay the cash consideration for our recent acquisitions. Our level of indebtedness, and restrictions under such indebtedness, could adversely affect our operations and liquidity.\nWe entered into a credit facility with Cerberus Business Finance, LLC (\u201cCerberus\u201d) in December 2016. As of the date of this report, approximately $45.0 million in principal amount is outstanding under our term loan facility with Cerberus. As of the date of this report, we also have $5.0 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility with Cerberus. Our outstanding indebtedness under the Cerberus credit facility is due in December 2021.\nThe Cerberus credit facility imposes various restrictions and covenants regarding the operation of our business, including covenants that require us to obtain Cerberus\u2019s consent before we can, among other things and subject to certain limited exceptions: (i) incur additional indebtedness or additional liens on our property, (ii) consummate acquisitions, dispositions, mergers or consolidations, (iii) make any change in the nature of our business, (iv) enter into transactions with our affiliates, or (v) repurchase or redeem any outstanding shares of our common stock or pay dividends or other distributions, other than stock dividends, to our stockholders. The Cerberus credit facility also imposes financial covenants that set financial standards we will be required to maintain. Further, as collateral for the Cerberus credit facility, we have granted a first priority security interest in favor of Cerberus in substantially all of our assets (including trademarks), and our indebtedness is guaranteed by our subsidiaries. If an event of default occurs under the credit facility, that is not forborne, or cured or waived in accordance with the terms of the credit facility, Cerberus has the right to terminate its obligations under the credit facility, accelerate the payment on any unpaid balance of the credit facility and exercise any other rights it may have, including foreclosing on our assets that serve as collateral for the loan. We obtained a waiver to this credit facility on April 28, 2017, due the late filing of the Company\u2019s Fiscal 2017 Form 10-K. Our failure to comply with the terms of our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect to our business, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe may seek to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness in the future. Any such refinancing would depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time, which could affect our ability to obtain attractive refinance terms when desired, or at all.\nIn addition, our level of indebtedness generally could adversely affect our operations and liquidity, by, among other things: (i) making it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions because we may not have sufficient cash flows to make our scheduled debt payments; (ii) causing us to use a larger portion of our cash flows to fund interest and principal payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital, product development and capital expenditures and other business activities; (iii) making it more difficult for us to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities or other strategic transactions, and to react to changes in market or industry conditions; and (iv) limiting\nour ability to borrow additional monies in the future to fund working capital, product development, capital expenditures, brand acquisitions and other general corporate purposes as and when needed, which could force us to suspend, delay or curtail business prospects, strategies or operations.\nOur future capital needs may be uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future, and such funds may not be available when needed, on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur capital requirements in future periods may be uncertain and could depend upon many factors, including, among others: acceptance of, and demand for, our brands; the costs of developing new brands; the extent to which we invest in new brands; the number and timing of our acquisitions and other strategic transactions; the costs associated with our expansion, if any; and the costs of litigation and enforcement activities to defend our trademarks. In the future, we may need to raise additional funds, and such funds may not be available when needed, on favorable terms, or at all. If we issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds, as we did with our public offering of our common stock in December 2016, our existing stockholders would experience dilution and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders, and if we incur additional debt to raise funds, as we did with our new credit facility with Cerberus entered into in December 2016, we may become over-leveraged and our ability to operate our business may be restricted by the agreements governing the debt. Further, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital transactions, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs.\nMoreover, our late filing of this Annual Report renders us ineligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on Form S-3, and we will not regain such eligibility until we have timely filed our periodic reports with the SEC for 12 consecutive calendar months. We do not know when we will meet this requirement, which depends upon our ability to file our periodic reports on a timely basis in the future. If we seek to raise capital through an offering of our securities while we remain ineligible to use Form S-3, our inability to use this form could limit our financing alternatives, reduce our ability to access capital in a timely manner and increase our transaction costs, any of which could make it more difficult to execute any such transaction successfully and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIf we cannot raise funds when needed, on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products and services, execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated customer requirements. This may materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur strategic and marketing initiatives may not be successful.\nIn recent periods, we have invested significant funds and management time in furtherance of our global strategic and marketing initiatives, which are designed to strengthen our brands, assist our licensees in generating increased sales of products bearing our brands and build value for our stockholders over the long term. We expect to continue and, in some cases, expand such initiatives in future periods. While we are hopeful that our efforts in executing on these initiatives will expand our business and build stockholder value over the long-term, we may not be successful in doing so and such initiatives may not result in the intended benefits. Any failure by us to execute on our strategic initiatives, or the failure of such initiatives to cause our revenues to grow, could have a materially adverse impact on our operating results and financial performance.\nWe must successfully maintain and/or upgrade our information technology systems.\nWe rely on various information technology systems, including our Enterprise Resource Planning system, to manage our operations, which subjects us to inherent costs and risks associated with maintaining, upgrading, replacing and changing these systems, including impairment of our information technology, potential disruption of our internal control systems, substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and delays or difficulties in upgrading existing systems, transitioning to new systems or integrating new systems into our current systems. If any of these risks were to materialize, our operations could be disrupted and our performance could be harmed.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of cybersecurity and other system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our licensees and franchisees are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Although we have not experienced any such cybersecurity or system failure, accident or breach to date, some of our licensees, including Target, have experienced such events in the past. If such an event were to occur to our internal systems, it could result in a material disruption of our operations, substantial costs to rectify or correct the failure, if possible, loss of or damage to our data or applications, inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information or the incurrence of other material liabilities. If such events were to occur to our licensees\u2019 or franchisees\u2019 systems, our royalty revenues could be reduced or disrupted due to decreased sales of our branded products as a result of reputational damage, diversion of costs and other resources from selling products bearing our brands or inability of our licensees or franchisees to calculate royalties or generate royalty reports. Any of these events could severely harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nChanges in our effective tax rates or tax provisions or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our net income.\nWe are subject to income tax in the United States, California and certain other state jurisdictions. In addition, following our acquisition of the Hi-Tec family of footwear brands, we are also subject to taxation in several foreign jurisdictions, which may have unusual, unfamiliar or particularly burdensome tax laws. Our new global tax structure could be negatively impacted by various factors, including changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions in which we earn income or changes in tax laws or interpretations of tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, all of which could impact our future effective income tax rates. Our effective tax rates could also be adversely affected in the future by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Any increase in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our future reported financial results or the way in which we conduct our business.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Further, we may be audited by tax authorities, which could evaluate and disagree with our judgments regarding our tax provisions. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be expensive to defend and materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could materially affect our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our stock may be volatile and shares of our common stock are relatively illiquid.\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to be subject to fluctuations as a result of various factors impacting our business, including, among others: (i) our financial results; (ii) the successful completion of any acquisition or strategic transaction, including the integration of the acquired assets or businesses into our existing business and realization of synergies and other benefits of the acquisition or transaction; (iii) announcements by us, our retail partners or our competitors, as applicable, regarding or affecting the retail environment either domestically or internationally, the reputation of our brands, our existing or new license agreements and brand representations or acquisitions, strategic alliances or other transactions; (iv) recruitment or departure of key personnel; (v) changes in the estimates of our financial results or changes in the recommendations of any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; (vi) any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, including the material weaknesses we identified as of January 28, 2017 that are described elsewhere in these risk factors, or any failures to comply with applicable public reporting requirements, as has occurred with this Annual Report and as is described elsewhere in these risk factors; (vii) market conditions in the retail industry and the economy as a whole; and (viii) the other risks described in these risk factors.\nFurther, as a result of our relatively small public float, our common stock may be less liquid than the common stock of companies with broader public ownership. Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of our\ncommon shares may have a greater impact on the trading price for our common stock than would be the case if our public float was larger.\nWe are not in compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s requirements for continued listing, and if NASDAQ does not concur that we have adequately remedied our non-compliance with applicable listing rules, our common stock may be delisted from trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders.\nOn May 3, 2017, we received a deficiency letter from The NASDAQ Stock Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) indicating that, as a result of not filing this Annual Report in a timely manner, we were not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) for continued listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The deficiency letter indicated that we have until July 3, 2017 to submit a plan to regain compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing standards; however, we believe our filing of this Annual Report has resulted in our regained compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing standards and has eliminated the need to submit such a compliance plan. Although we believe that, as of our filing of this Annual Report, we are currently in compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements, we could fail to comply with these requirements again in the future. In that case, we would receive additional deficiency letters from NASDAQ and our common stock could be delisted from trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, which could severely limit the liquidity of our common stock and materially adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nWe may not pay dividends regularly or at all in the future.\nThe determination regarding the payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, and therefore we may not pay any dividends in future periods, whether or not we generate sufficient cash to do so. In addition, pursuant to our credit facility with Cerberus, subject to limited exceptions, we are prohibited from paying dividends or making other distributions to our stockholders without Cerberus\u2019s consent. As a result, any return on an investment in our common stock may be limited to an appreciation in the value of our common stock.\nOffers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nThe sale by our stockholders of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur upon the expiration of any statutory holding period, such as under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, or upon expiration of any lock-up periods applicable to outstanding shares, including under the lock-up agreements entered into in connection with our public offering of our common stock in December 2016, or upon our issuance of shares upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants or the vesting of restricted stock units, could cause the market price of our common stock to fall. The availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make it more difficult for us to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future when needed, on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation allows our Board of Directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation allows our Board of Directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, without action by our stockholders. Subject to the restrictions under our new credit facility with Cerberus, such shares of preferred stock may be issued on terms determined by our Board of Directors in its discretion, and may have rights, privileges and preferences superior to those of our common stock. For instance, such shares of preferred stock could have liquidation rights that are senior to the liquidation preference applicable to our common stock, could have superior voting or conversion rights, which could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock, or could have other terms that negatively impact the voting control or other rights of our common stockholders. Additionally, the ownership interest of holders of our common stock would be diluted following the issuance of any shares of our preferred stock. Further, the preferred stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method for discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company.\nWe may fail to meet publicly announced financial guidance or other expectations about our business, which would cause our common stock to decline in value.\nFrom time to time, we provide forward-looking financial guidance to our investors. Such statements are based on our current views, expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, performance, achievements or share prices to be materially different from any future results, performance, achievements or share prices expressed or implied by such statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, among others: changes to the assumptions used to forecast or calculate such guidance; risks related to acquisitions or strategic transactions we may pursue in the future, including the risk that we do not realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction; and risks related to our performance and our branded licensing business model.", "PERMNO": 79315, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "APEX"}
