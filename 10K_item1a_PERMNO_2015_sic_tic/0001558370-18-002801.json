{"cik": "38984", "company": "Real Industry, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-04-05", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nBefore deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report and in our other filings with the SEC, including our subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are in addition to risks that apply to most businesses and are not the only ones we face. The order in which the risks appear is not intended as an indication of their relative weight, likelihood or importance. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price for our common stock will likely decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nWe note that since the Company\u2019s acquisition of Real Alloy in February 2015 (the \u201cReal Alloy Acquisition\u201d), given the significance of Real Alloy\u2019s financial results, operations and business to the Company\u2019s financial results and operations, we have reported risks associated with the Company, Real Alloy and its operations, the Company\u2019s ownership and holding company structure, and the Company\u2019s common stock generally. On March 29, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court approved the Real Alloy Sale - namely, the sale of the assets of the Real Alloy Debtors and the equity interests in their non-U.S. Real Alloy subsidiaries to the Real Alloy Purchaser. Following closing of the Real Alloy Sale, Real Industry will no longer have any economic interest in the Real Alloy business operations, including Real Alloy\u2019s operations that are not a part of the Chapter 11 Cases. We do not anticipate any recovery to Real Industry from its equity interest in RAIH in connection with the Real Alloy Sale. The Real Alloy Sale is expected to be consummated in the second quarter of 2018. As a result, the risk factors discussed below may not reflect all risks that Real Alloy may face following the Real Alloy Sale.\nRisks Associated with Our Chapter 11 Cases\nWe are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with our Chapter 11 Cases. On the Petition Date, we and a majority of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. Our European, Canadian and Mexican operations, as well as the Goodyear, Arizona joint venture are not included in the filings. Our Chapter 11 Cases are being jointly administered and procedurally consolidated in the Bankruptcy Court under the case of Real Industry, Case No. 17-12464 (KJC), and the caption \u201cIn re: Real Industry, Inc., et al.\u201d. On March 1, 2018, Real Industry filed the RI Plan with the Bankruptcy Court. There can be no assurance that the RI Plan will be approved by the Bankruptcy Court or implemented successfully. Subject to the effective date of the RI Plan (with respect to Real Industry) or the closing of the Real Alloy Sale (with respect to Real Alloy), or other reorganization or resolution of the Chapter 11 Cases, each of the Debtors will continue to operate their businesses as debtors-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.\nWe are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Cases, which may lead to potential adverse effects on our liquidity, results of operations, condition (financial or otherwise), ability to attract acquisition opportunities or business prospects. Our operations, our ability to develop and execute our business plan, our financial condition, our liquidity, and our continuation as a going concern, are all subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with our Chapter 11 Cases. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nwhether the conditions to consummate the transactions contemplated by the RI Plan and Real Alloy Sale will be satisfied or waived;\n\u00b7\nour ability to comply with and operate under any cash management orders entered by the Bankruptcy Court from time to time;\n\u00b7\nthe high costs of the Bankruptcy Proceedings and related professional costs and fees;\n\u00b7\nour ability to attract, motivate, and retain key personnel, especially in our current environment;\n\u00b7\nour ability to maintain our relationships with our suppliers, service providers, customers, employees, and other third-parties;\n\u00b7\nour ability to maintain critical contracts on reasonably acceptable terms and conditions;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of third-parties to seek and obtain relief from the automatic stay to terminate contracts and other agreements with us;\n\u00b7\nthe actions and decisions of our creditors and other third-parties who have interests in our Chapter 11 Cases that may be inconsistent with our plans; and\n\u00b7\nthe possibility that the Chapter 11 Cases will disrupt or impede Real Alloy\u2019s operations.\nThese risks and uncertainties could affect our business and operations in various ways. For example, negative events or publicity associated with our Chapter 11 Cases could adversely affect our relationships with potential acquisition targets and financing sources. Further, critical suppliers, vendors and customers may determine not to do business with Real Alloy due to the Bankruptcy Proceedings, and Real Alloy may not be successful in securing alternative sources or markets. Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, transactions outside the ordinary course of business are subject to the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court, which may limit our ability to respond in a timely manner to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities. A long period of operations under Bankruptcy Court protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Additionally, further losses of key personnel or erosion of employee morale could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our operations as normal, thereby adversely affecting our business and results of operations. So long as the proceedings related to these cases continue, our management will be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort dealing with the reorganization instead of focusing exclusively on business operations. The failure to retain or attract and maintain members of our management team, and other key personnel could impair our ability to execute our strategy and implement operational initiatives, thereby having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. So long as the proceedings related to these cases continue, we will be required to incur substantial costs for professional fees and other expenses associated with the administration of the Chapter 11 Cases, including the cost of litigation. In general, litigation can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against. Such litigation could result in settlements or damages that could significantly affect our financial results. It is also possible that certain parties will commence litigation with respect to the treatment of their claims. It is not possible to predict the potential litigation that we may become party to, nor the final resolution of such litigation. The impact of any such litigation on our business and financial stability, however, could be material.\nAs a result of these risks and uncertainties, we cannot predict the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 Cases may have on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe RI Plan may not become effective as proposed or at all, and the Real Alloy Sale may not be consummated, in which case we may require additional funding. While the RI Plan has been filed with the Bankruptcy Court, it may not become effective because it is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent; some of which are beyond our control and may not be satisfied. Further, parties in interest to the RI Plan may object to, or the Bankruptcy Court may not otherwise approve, the RI Plan\u2019s classification of claims and interests or other terms or treatment of claims and interests under the RI Plan. We may not have our plan of reorganization confirmed prior to the end of our exclusivity period under the Bankruptcy Code, or the Bankruptcy Court may permit competing plans.\nThe Bankruptcy Code provides that a class of interest has accepted a plan of reorganization if it has been accepted by at least two-thirds in amount of allowed interest in such class that have voted to accept or reject such plan. In the event that we do not receive sufficient votes in support of the RI Plan, we will likely seek an alternative plan of reorganization; however, it is uncertain whether the terms of such alternative plan will be similar to the terms of the RI Plan.\nTherefore, there can be no assurance that the RI Plan will become effective, that the Bankruptcy Court or necessary parties in interest will approve the RI Plan, or that RI Plan or any necessary alternative plan of reorganization as approved by the Bankruptcy Court contains terms as favorable as the RI Plan and that the Company will emerge from its Chapter 11 Case as contemplated by the RI Plan.\nSimilarly, while the Bankruptcy Court has approved the sale to, and Real Alloy\u2019s entry into the Asset Purchase Agreement with the Real Alloy Purchaser, there are conditions precedent to the Real Alloy Sale. Some of these conditions precedent may be out of Real Alloy\u2019s control, and there can be no assurance that these will be satisfied or that the Real Alloy Sale will be consummated.\nDelays or other hurdles to confirmation of the RI Plan or the consummation of the Real Alloy Sale may require us or Real Alloy to seek additional financing during the pendency of the Bankruptcy Proceedings or may prompt a default under the RI DIP Financing Facility or RA DIP Financing Facility. If sufficient funds are not available, we may be required to liquidate. If the RI Plan effective date is delayed or does not occur, or if the Real Alloy Sale is delayed or not consummated, the Company or the Real Alloy Debtors, as the case may be, may not have sufficient cash available in order to operate their respective businesses. In that case, the Company or the Real Alloy Debtors may need new or additional post-petition financing, which may increase the costs of consummating the RI Plan or Real Alloy\u2019s exit from bankruptcy. There can be no assurance of the terms on which such financing may be available or if such financing will be available. If the transactions contemplated by the RI Plan or the Real Alloy Sale are not completed, it may become necessary to amend the RI Plan or the Asset Purchase Agreement and related sale procedures. The terms of any such amendments are uncertain and could result in material additional expense and result in material delays in the Chapter 11 Cases. If either the RI Plan or Real Alloy Sale do not become effective, if current financing is insufficient, or if other financing is not available, the Company and the Real Alloy Debtors could be required to liquidate under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nIn order to successfully emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, a plan under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code must become effective or other exit arrangement must be consummated. There can be no assurance that the RI Plan will be approved by the Bankruptcy Court or that the effective date of the RI Plan will occur, which would permit the Company to emerge from our Chapter 11 Case and continue operations. Likewise, there can be no assurance that the Real Alloy Sale can be consummated, or that a plan of reorganization for Real Alloy could be developed or consummated. If the RI Plan is not confirmed or a substantially identical plan of reorganization is not confirmed with the support of our stakeholders, including the holder of the Redeemable Preferred Stock or lenders under the RI DIP Financing Facility, and we are unable to meet our liquidity needs, we may have to take other actions to seek additional financing to the extent available or we could be forced to consider other alternatives to maximize potential recovery for stakeholders, including liquidation under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nThere can be no assurance that the current cash positions of the Company and Real Alloy, as well as funds available from the RI DIP Financing Facility, or RA DIP Financing Facility, and amounts of cash from future operations, will be sufficient to fund ongoing operations during the Chapter 11 Cases. In the event that the Company or Real Alloy do not have sufficient cash to meet their respective liquidity requirements, and the current financing for the Company or Real Alloy is insufficient or exit financing is not available in connection with the resolution of the Company\u2019s or Real Alloy\u2019s Chapter 11 Cases, the Company or Real Alloy, as the case may be, may be required to seek additional financing. There can be no assurance that such additional financing would be available, or, if available, would be available on reasonably acceptable terms. Failure to secure any necessary exit financing, or additional financing, would have a material adverse effect on the operations and ability of the Company or Real Alloy to continue as a going concern.\nAny Chapter 11 plan that we or Real Alloy may implement will be based in large part upon assumptions and analyses developed by us. If these assumptions and analyses prove to be incorrect, or adverse market conditions exist or worsen, such plan may be unsuccessful in its execution. Any Chapter 11 plan or other strategy that we may implement, including the RI Plan and Real Alloy Sale, will affect our capital and the ownership and structure of our business, and will reflect assumptions and analyses based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, and expected future developments, as well as other factors that we consider appropriate under the circumstances. Similar risks apply in the event that Real Alloy instead pursues a Chapter 11 plan rather than the Real Alloy Sale. Whether actual future results and developments will be consistent with our expectations and assumptions depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nour ability to substantially change our capital structure;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain adequate liquidity and financing sources;\n\u00b7\nour ability to maintain customers\u2019 confidence in our viability as a continuing entity and to attract and retain sufficient business from them;\n\u00b7\nour ability to retain key employees, and\n\u00b7\nthe overall strength and stability of general economic conditions of the financial and aluminum industries, both in the U.S. and in global markets.\nThe failure of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect the successful reorganization of our business. In addition, any Chapter 11 plan or other exit strategy, including the RI Plan and Real Alloy Sale, will rely upon financial projections, including with respect to revenues, Adjusted EBITDA, capital expenditures, debt service, cash flow and aluminum price projections. Financial projections are necessarily speculative, and it is likely that one or more of the assumptions and estimates that are the basis of these financial forecasts will not be realized. In the case of the Company or Real Alloy, the forecasts will be even more speculative than normal, because they may involve fundamental changes in the nature of the capital structure of the Company or Real Alloy. Accordingly, we expect that our actual financial condition and results of operations will differ, perhaps materially, from what we have anticipated. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the results or developments contemplated by any resolution of the Chapter 11 Cases that we or Real Alloy may implement will occur or, even if they do occur, that they will have the anticipated effects on us, Real Alloy or our respective businesses or operations. The failure of any such results or developments to materialize as anticipated could materially and adversely affect the successful execution of such resolution.\nCertain claims may not be discharged and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The Bankruptcy Code provides that the confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan discharges a debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to the debtor\u2019s filing for bankruptcy protection. Any claims not ultimately discharged through a Chapter 11 plan, or assumed by a third-party pursuant to an order of the Bankruptcy Court, could be asserted against us or Real Alloy, as the case may be, and may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations on a post-reorganization basis.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, our historical financial information will not be indicative of our future financial performance and realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities are subject to uncertainty. Our capital structure will be significantly altered through the implementation of the RI Plan and the Real Alloy Sale. As a result of the consummation of the RI Plan, the Real Alloy Sale and the transactions contemplated thereby, we expect to be subject to the fresh start reporting rules required under the Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 852, Reorganizations (\u201cASC 852\u201d). Under applicable fresh start reporting rules that may apply to us upon the RI Plan\u2019s effective date, our assets and liabilities would be adjusted to fair values and our accumulated deficit would be restated to zero. Accordingly, our consolidated financial condition and results of operations from and after the RI Plan effective date will not be comparable to the financial condition or results of operations reflected in our consolidated historical financial statements.\nIn connection with the implementation of the RI Plan, it is also possible that additional restructuring and related charges may be identified and recorded in future periods. Such sales, disposals, liquidations, settlements, or charges could be material to our consolidated financial position and the results of operations in any given period.\nOur ability to use our pre-emergence tax attributes may be significantly limited under the U.S. federal income tax rules. We have generated NOL and certain tax credits for U.S. federal income tax purposes through the taxable year ending December 31, 2017. Our ability to use any NOLs and other tax attributes, including certain recognized built in losses, to offset future taxable income or taxes owed may be significantly limited if we undergo an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in section 382 of the Tax Code in connection with the RI Plan and do not qualify or elect to use a special bankruptcy rule. An entity that experiences an ownership change generally is subject to an annual limitation on its use of its pre-ownership change NOLs and other tax attributes after the ownership change equal to the equity value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate posted by the Internal Revenue Service (subject to certain adjustments). If we undergo an ownership change in connection with the consummation of the RI Plan, and don\u2019t meet the qualifications of a special bankruptcy rule, however, the equity value for purposes of determining the limitation on NOLs and other tax attributes will reflect the increase in value resulting from the cancellation of claims. The annual limitation could also be increased each year to the extent that there is an unused limitation in a prior year. Alternatively, if we qualify for and elect to use a special bankruptcy rule that would prevent a limitation on use of the tax attributes from applying, our NOLs would first be reduced to the extent of certain prior interest deductions taken on account of indebtedness that will be converted into equity under the RI Plan, if any, in the event we experience another ownership change within two years after the RI Plan Effective Date the annual limitation would be zero and we will effectively lose the ability to use any of the NOLs. We anticipate that we will experience an ownership change as a result of the RI Plan.\nEven if a RI Plan is consummated, we may not be able to achieve our stated goals and continue as a going concern. Even if the RI Plan or another Chapter 11 plan is consummated, we will continue to face a number of risks, including those related to changes in economic conditions and increasing expenses or as otherwise described in these Risk Factors under \u201cRisks Related to Real Industry as a Holding Company.\u201d Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that the RI Plan or any other Chapter 11 plan will achieve our stated goals.\nUnder the terms of the RELY DIP Credit Agreement, the RELY DIP Lenders have agreed to enter into a definitive equity purchase agreement pursuant to which the RELY DIP Lenders, or their affiliates, will purchase up to 49% of the Company\u2019s common stock at emergence from the RI Chapter 11 Case for $17.5 million. Likewise, pursuant to the RI Plan, the Plan Sponsor has committed to arrange for up to a $500 million credit facility for the Company to pursue its business plan post emergence from the RI Chapter 11 Case. However, if we are unable to obtain such a credit facility, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing or other various means to fund our business upon emergence from the RI Chapter 11 Case. Our access to additional financing is, and for the foreseeable future will likely continue to be, extremely limited, if it is available at all. Therefore, adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms, if they are available at all. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital. As a result, we cannot give any assurance of our ability to continue as a going concern, even if a plan is confirmed.\nRisks Related to Real Industry as a Holding Company\nWe face risks from our current operations, legacy operations and status as a holding company. The main risks we have faced in the past, at the time of filing of the Chapter 11 Cases and during the pendency of the Bankruptcy Proceedings may differ significantly from the risks we may face following emergency from the Bankruptcy Proceedings.\nFollowing emergence from Bankruptcy Proceedings, we may not be able to effectively fund or execute on our business strategy. The RI Plan, subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court, provides for a plan of reorganization with a restructured capital structure, including the elimination of the Redeemable Preferred Stock, and a commitment for an acquisition finance lending facility of up to $500 million. However, our future viability and utilization of our valuable tax attributes depend on execution on our business strategy. While we believe that the acquisition financing facility will assist in our needed financing, we may also need to conduct future rights offerings to existing equity holders, offerings of equity to the owners of target entities, or leveraged financing transactions to acquire target entities. There can be no assurance we will be able to secure adequate financing on acceptable terms or to otherwise execute on our business strategy, and the results of our operations and the value of the common stock in Reorganized RELY may suffer.\nOur financial condition and results of operations will depend on our ability to acquire and integrate businesses that perform and meet expectations after closing. A key element of our business strategy involves the acquisition and integration of profitable operating businesses. We may experience challenges identifying, financing, consummating and integrating such acquisitions. Competition exists in the market for the acquisition of profitable operating companies. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition opportunities that are available at attractive valuations, if at all. Even if we do find suitable acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to consummate the acquisitions on commercially acceptable terms, as suitable financing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms, on a timely basis, or at all.\nEven if we are successful in completing additional acquisitions, these could require significant investments of capital, management attention, and integration effort. We may also encounter difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations, personnel, technologies, products, and information systems of acquired companies, and retaining key personnel. Further, the acquired entities themselves must perform successfully subject to the risks of its business, industry, and other factors. These risks are applicable even for businesses we intend to run on a stand-alone basis. We recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $61.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and an additional $33.6 million charge in the year ended December 31, 2017. We may incur additional significant goodwill impairment charges in the future. Acquisitions could disrupt relationships with existing customers, suppliers, and strategic partners of the newly acquired entities and may create other contractual, intellectual property, or employment issues. The acquisition of another company or business may also require us to enter into a business, industry or geographic market in which we have little or no prior experience. These challenges could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, harm our reputation and increase our operating costs, and these challenges could be magnified as the size of the acquisition increases.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions or that, if consummated, we will successfully integrate the businesses or otherwise realize the benefits anticipated from these acquisitions. Even if we are able to grow and build our operations, any failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may never realize the full value of assets we may sell. We may from time to time decide to sell operating subsidiaries or assets based on any number of factors, including a desire to monetize an asset to finance working capital or other strategic plans or because such operations may not perform as expected. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing such future\ntransactions. If such a transaction is completed, it may reduce the size of our business or our cash flow. There is also no assurance that we will receive adequate consideration in the disposition of any operating subsidiary or asset. As a result, any future disposition of operating subsidiaries or assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have experienced substantial losses from continuing operations in recent years and may experience losses in the future. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we reported losses from continuing operations of $120.8 million, $103.2 million, $31.7 million, and $0.1 million, respectively. We may experience operating losses and net losses in the future, which could make it difficult to fund our operations, finance acquisitions and achieve our business plan, any of which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur debt agreements as of December 31, 2017 and future debt financing arrangements into which we or our subsidiaries may enter, may contain various covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions and also require us to meet financial maintenance tests. Failure to comply with these covenants could have a material adverse effect on our operations, business and financial results. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $416.9 million of indebtedness outstanding under the RA DIP Financing Facility, the Senior Secured Notes and various capital leases related to Real Alloy. As of December 31, 2017, Real Alloy was in default under the Senior Secured Notes, which were subject to compromise. Further, Real Alloy has additional borrowing capacity under the RA DIP ABL Facility and its German subsidiary\u2019s \u20ac50 million nonrecourse factoring facility (the \u201cFactoring Facility\u201d). Interest costs related to this indebtedness, together with the dividends on the Redeemable Preferred Stock (which is also subject to compromise as of December 31, 2017), are substantial. The RA DIP Financing Facility, Senior Secured Notes, Factoring Facility and Redeemable Preferred Stock contain, and the instruments governing our other future indebtedness may contain, certain customary restrictions, covenants, and provisions for mandatory repayment upon the occurrence of certain events, and provisions for events of default that will require us, Real Alloy or other acquired entities to satisfy certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios, restrict the ability to engage in specified types of transactions, and otherwise limit the distributions of funds from Real Alloy or other entities acquired in the future to us. This overall leverage and the terms of our financing arrangements could:\n\u00b7\nlimit the ability to pay dividends or management fees, to make distributions or to repay intercompany loans, especially from Real Alloy, and future subsidiaries, to us;\n\u00b7\nmake it more difficult to satisfy obligations under the terms of our indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nlimit the ability to refinance this indebtedness on terms acceptable to Real Alloy, us, or at all;\n\u00b7\nlimit the flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions in the industries in which we or Real Alloy operate and increase the vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nrequire the dedication of a substantial portion of cash flow to make interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, thereby limiting the availability of cash flow to distribute to us or to fund future acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, business activities, and other general corporate requirements;\n\u00b7\nrestrict sales of key assets;\n\u00b7\nlimit the ability to substantially change our business or enter into new lines of business;\n\u00b7\nlimit the ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, to fund growth or acquisitions or for general corporate purposes, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly if any ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; or\n\u00b7\ncause a competitive disadvantage by reducing our flexibility in responding to increased competition.\nUpon the occurrence of an event of default under any such financing arrangement, the relevant lenders could assess increased interest rates, accelerate the maturity of the debt or foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt, and events of default could be triggered under other financing arrangements with cross-default provisions. In this event, we may lack sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. In addition, any limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt or to take other actions could significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing. We are currently in default under our Senior Secured Notes.\nOur ability to use our U.S. NOLs to offset future U.S. taxable income may be limited as a result of past events, the Real Alloy Acquisition, the financings related to the Real Alloy Acquisition, the Bankruptcy Proceedings, the RI Plan, the Real Alloy Sale, or as the result of future acquisitions, financings or other issuances or transfers of our common stock. As of December 31, 2017, we reported U.S. NOLs of approximately $960.5 million, which will begin to expire if not used before the tax year ending December 31, 2027. For accounting purposes, a valuation allowance is required to reduce our potential deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of such assets will not be realized due to the lack of sufficient taxable income. As a result of uncertainties about the timing and amount of future U.S. taxable income, we have a valuation allowance of $249.5 million recorded against our U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017, and expect to continually review and evaluate the valuation allowance in future periods.\nOur ability to fully utilize our existing U.S. NOLs could be limited or eliminated as a result of changes in U.S. federal tax laws and regulations or should we: i) be found by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) to not be able to avail ourselves of Section 382(l)(5) of the Tax Code in connection with the plan of reorganization following the Fremont Bankruptcy Proceedings or with the RI Plan following the current Bankruptcy Proceedings; ii) undergo an \u201cownership change\u201d as described under Section 382 of the Tax Code; iii) be deemed to have abandoned an active business; or iv) not return to profitability or be only marginally profitable in the future.\nAlthough we cannot assure you that the IRS will agree with our position, we believe that, both as of Fremont\u2019s emergence from its proceedings under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code through the Real Alloy Acquisition until the present time, Real Industry has met the criteria under Section 382(l)(5) of the Tax Code to be able to utilize its U.S. NOLs to offset future taxable income, if any.\nOur ability to utilize our U.S. NOLs, however, will be subject to significant limitation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if, after the effectiveness of the RI Plan, the Company undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Tax Code. For this purpose, an \u201cownership change\u201d is generally defined as greater than a 50% change in equity ownership by value, over a rolling three-year period. We may experience an ownership change in the future as a result of changes in our common stock ownership, which would result in a limitation on our ability to utilize our U.S. NOLs. Separately, any changes to tax rules or the interpretation of tax rules could negatively impact our ability to recognize benefits from our U.S. NOLs.\nWhile there is no guarantee that the IRS will agree with our position, we believe that the Real Alloy Acquisition and related financings did not result in an \u201cownership change\u201d for purposes of Section 382 of the Tax Code. The Company received an opinion letter (the \u201cSection 382 Opinion Letter\u201d) from its U.S. tax counsel, Blank Rome LLP, substantially to the effect that the Real Alloy Acquisition and related financings should not result in an \u201cownership change\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that the Company should be able to use its U.S. NOLs to offset U.S. taxable income generated by Real Alloy. The Section 382 Opinion Letter is restricted to the precise terms described therein and the Company or its stockholders may engage in subsequent transactions that would result in an \u201cownership change.\u201d Additionally, the Company adopted the Tax Benefit Preservation Provision in order to protect stockholder value by preserving our U.S. NOLs. There is no guarantee, however, that the Tax Benefit Preservation Provision will be effective in protecting our U.S. NOLs and other tax assets.\nFurther, our NOLs may be reduced as a result of the Real Alloy Sale and the resolution of the RA Chapter 11 Case to the extent of any discharge of indebtedness income or related tax attribute reduction related to cancellation of indebtedness of the Real Alloy Debtors.\nThe amount of our U.S. NOLs has not been audited or otherwise validated by the IRS. The IRS could challenge the amount of our U.S. NOLs and other tax assets, which could result in an increase in our liability for income taxes in the future. Further, our U.S. NOLs only have value to the extent we generate U.S. taxable income. If we are unable to generate U.S. taxable income prior to the expiration of the U.S. NOLs, or if we are only marginally profitable during such period, we will be limited in our ability to utilize the tax benefits related to our U.S. NOLs. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient U.S. taxable income to be able to utilize our U.S. NOLs prior to their expiration. Finally, the use of U.S. NOLs is subject to various tax laws and regulations and any changes in such or the interpretations thereof.\nFunding for our future acquisitions and operations following emergence from Bankruptcy Proceedings could increase our liabilities, trigger negative tax consequences or dilute, or rank preferentially to, our stockholders. Following emergence from Bankruptcy Proceedings, we intend to fund any future acquisition through a mix of our available cash, use of leveraged financing, the sale of equity securities in private placements or in registered offerings, rights offerings to existing stockholders, and debt financings. Utilizing these funding sources can result in increased debt or contingent liabilities, adverse tax consequences, substantial capital commitments, loss of some of our U.S. NOLs, or dilution. Any of these events could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations and could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nIn order to fund our future operations or acquisitions, we may sell preferred equity securities or convertible debt securities with rights, preferences and privileges senior to our existing stockholders. In such event, future security holders could be entitled to dividends, liquidation or other transaction preferences, or voting rights that are not provided to our existing common stockholders. Further, with or without preferential terms, future issuances of securities could result in dilution to our stockholders.\nOur Redeemable Preferred Stock issued as partial consideration in the Real Alloy Acquisition has superior rights to our common stock. In connection with the Real Alloy Acquisition, we issued $25.0 million, or 25,000 shares, of Redeemable Preferred Stock to Aleris Corporation (\u201cAleris\u201d) to be held in an escrow to secure Aleris\u2019 indemnification obligations in connection with the Real Alloy Acquisition. The Redeemable Preferred Stock generally has no voting rights, except, among other customary matters, for any merger (unless the Redeemable Preferred Stock remains outstanding or is purchased at the liquidation preference), or for any acquisition valued at more than 5% of the consolidated assets of the Company (so long as at least $10.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Redeemable Preferred Stock remain outstanding). We currently accrue quarterly dividends on the Redeemable Preferred Stock at a rate of 9%; after being payable in-kind for the first two years, dividends are currently payable in cash. Other than dividends or distributions payable on our common stock in shares of common stock, the Redeemable Preferred Stock ranks superior to our common stock in the payment of accrued and accumulated dividends, declaration and payment of new dividends and distributions, and making of redemptions. The Redeemable Preferred Stock could have a material impact on the rights of our common stockholders in terms of dividends, repurchases and redemptions by, or in the event of a liquidation of, the Company.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the liquidation value of the Redeemable Preferred Stock is $28.5 million and accrued dividends payable subject to compromise of $1.8 million. Under the RI Plan, as proposed, the holder of the Redeemable Preferred Stock will receive, in exchange for full settlement of its $28.5 million liquidation preference and $1.8 million of accrued dividends (as of December 31, 2017), a $2.0 million cash payment plus either a) 31% of the newly issued equity in Reorganized RELY, if stockholders vote as a class to approve the RI Plan; or b) 35% of the newly issued equity in Reorganized RELY, if the common stockholders do not vote to approve the RI Plan as a class. The holder of the Redeemable Preferred Stock has agreed to support the RI Plan pursuant to a separate agreement with the Plan Sponsor. On March 29, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court approved the RI Disclosure Statement and authorized Real Industry to solicit votes on the RI Plan pursuant to Bankruptcy Court-approved procedures. Real Industry commenced solicitation of the RI Plan on March 30, 2018.\nWe depend on key personnel to achieve our business and strategic objectives. As a holding company that seeks to identify, acquire and maintain operating companies with functioning management teams and operational support departments, Real Industry maintains a lean management and operations team. The size of our staff may limit the number of opportunities we may pursue in depth at any given time. In addition, we may from time to time need to consult with third-party strategic, financial, legal or other business advisors in order to assess and pursue operational matters, strategic objectives, transactions or financings, which may increase our general and administrative expense.\nFurther, we depend on the members of our senior management team to execute our business plan and strategy and to manage our business and day-to-day operations, including identifying, structuring, closing and monitoring business acquisitions. Our senior management team has critical industry experience and relationships that we rely upon to implement our business plan.\nOur holding company organizational structure makes Real Industry largely dependent on funding from, and highly subject to the risks and uncertainties of, its operating subsidiaries. This holding company structure may not provide the benefits we expect. Real Industry is a holding company with no current business operations of its own. Beyond the companies that we have either formed or acquired, Real Industry\u2019s only significant assets are our NOLs, our cash and our equity interests in, and our obligations from, our subsidiaries. To the extent we operate subsidiaries as stand-alone businesses and such subsidiaries are substantially larger entities than our holding company, we are subject to the business, industry, geographic, and market risks, regulations and uncertainties of such\nsubsidiaries. The impact of these may be significant to Real Industry and could have a negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nFurther, we completed the Reincorporation and our past acquisitions to establish and maintain a holding company organizational structure, and we plan to make future acquisitions within this structure, because of the strategic, business and financing flexibility that we believe it affords us. Our holding company structure may not keep the assets and liabilities of the Company and any new businesses we acquire legally separate. In such case, the increased costs of maintaining a separate holding company, including the administrative costs and expenses associated with keeping separate records and separate corporate or regulatory filings, may be incurred without realizing the possible benefits.\nIn the future, following our emergence from the RI Chapter 11 Case, if we are unable to receive funds from our operating subsidiaries, we may not be able to fund holding company operations. As a result, we could experience a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations, and result in the loss of our stockholders\u2019 entire investment in Reorganized RELY.\nU.S. tax law changes have reduced the corporate tax rate and otherwise changed the corporate tax regime, which could impose new taxes on our operations, limit certain business deductions or negatively affect the value of our deferred tax assets. In December 2017, Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The legislation includes a reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, a one-time tax imposed at a reduced rate on un-repatriated offshore earnings, limitations on the deduction for interest expense, and immediate tax deductions for the cost of certain qualified property instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time. Additionally, the new law generally precludes the carryback of NOLs; however, there is unlimited carryover of NOLs arising from and after 2018, but these NOLs cannot offset more than 80% of taxable income. Conversely, while pre-2018 NOLs remain subject to the prior twenty-year carryover period, there is not a corresponding limit on the percentage of a company\u2019s taxable income that can be offset by pre-2018 NOLs.\nPending legal proceedings and other contingent liabilities may impact our financial condition and results of operations, lowering our stock price, and limiting our ability to use our common stock as consideration in future transactions. Our subsidiary, SGGH, has been subject in the past to a number of lawsuits seeking monetary damages or injunctive relief and it has potential other contingent liabilities, including repurchase claims, which relate to Fremont\u2019s prior businesses and are presented in discontinued operations. For a summary of our material legal proceedings, see \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Note 23-Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report. Additional litigation may be filed against us, or our subsidiaries, or disputes may arise in the future concerning matters involving the discontinued operations. We and SGGH have been and intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves in all legal proceedings in which we are involved, however, the outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain and could materially adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the costs to defend SGGH or the Company in these matters may be significant. In turn, these could have a material impact on the price of our common stock, which may limit our ability to utilize our common stock as consideration for potential future acquisitions and other transactions in which we may engage.\nSGGH is subject to residential mortgage-backed securities defense, indemnity and contribution claims. In connection with residential mortgage-backed securities offerings (\u201cRMBS Offerings\u201d) involving loans originated by one of Fremont\u2019s subsidiaries, Fremont Investment & Loan (\u201cFIL\u201d), either or both of FIL and its subsidiary entered into mortgage loan purchase agreements, underwriting agreements, and indemnification and contribution agreements, which contained various representations and warranties relating to the loans. Investment banks involved in these RMBS Offerings have been sued in a number of actions concerning their activities related to subprime mortgages (\u201cRMBS Actions\u201d), where neither FIL, nor its subsidiary, are a named defendant. FIL and its subsidiary have received demands for defense, indemnity and contribution from defendants in various RMBS Actions. Each of these demands has been rejected as we believe the demanding parties are being sued for conduct not chargeable to FIL or its subsidiary. There is no assurance that FIL or its subsidiary will not be named as a defendant in additional RMBS Actions or receive additional demands for defense, indemnity and contribution. We intend to vigorously defend any claims seeking defense, indemnity or contribution, but we cannot presently predict whether such claims will be pursued or what the outcome would be. However, if the investment banks suffer losses in connection with RMBS Actions and successfully pursue claims against FIL, its subsidiary or SGGH, this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur data and information systems and network infrastructure may be subject to hacking or other cyber-security threats, giving unauthorized persons access to and the ability to misappropriate our customer data, and proprietary business information. In our operations, we store and transmit proprietary information for ourselves and for our customers. We have offices, operations and employees in various locations throughout the U.S., Europe, Canada and Mexico. Our operations are dependent upon the connectivity and continuity of our facilities and operations. Despite our security measures, our information systems and network infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks or could be breached due to an employee error or other disruption that could result in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information or an interruption of our networks that has the potential to significantly interfere with and disrupt our business operations. Breaches of our security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. Since techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures in advance of such an attack on our systems. In addition, although we attempt to validate the security of such services, because of vendors that use cyber or \u201ccloud\u201d storage of information as part of their service or product offerings, our proprietary information may be misappropriated by third-parties. In the event of an actual or perceived breach of our security, or the security of one of our vendors, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures and our attractiveness as a business partner could be harmed and we could suffer damage to our reputation or our business, or lose existing customers and lose our ability to obtain new customers. Additionally, misappropriation of our proprietary business information could prove competitively harmful to our business.\nCompliance with laws or regulations governing our current or future operations may adversely affect our business or cause us to alter our business strategy. We and Real Alloy are subject to statutes and regulations at the U.S. federal, state and local, and foreign level, as may be any entity we acquire. The inability to comply with these statutes and regulations in the business segments, geographic regions and jurisdictions in which we, Real Alloy or future subsidiaries operate could result in substantial costs, including fines, civil penalties, and criminal sanctions or costs associated with upgrades to improve facilities or changes in manufacturing or other processes in order to achieve and maintain regulatory compliance, which could, depending on their magnitude, individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and our stock price. Further, new legislation may be enacted or new interpretations, rulings or regulations could be adopted, potentially with retroactive effect, any of which could harm us, our operations, our plans and our stockholders. We may seek to acquire new businesses subject to legislation or regulations with which we are not currently familiar. Compliance with existing laws and regulations, changes to laws and regulations or entering into new regulated industries may cause us to alter our operations or business strategy in order to minimize the adverse impact on our business and financial performance or to avail ourselves of new or different opportunities. Such changes could result in material differences in the strategies and plans set forth in this Annual Report. Thus, any such changes, if they occur, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Real Alloy\nAs noted above, following the Real Alloy Sale, which was approved by the Bankruptcy Court on March 29, 2018 and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018, we will not have an economic interest in the Real Alloy business. As a result, the risk factors discussed below may not impact Real Industry, nor may they reflect risks that Real Alloy may face in the event of a failed Real Alloy Sale. The main risks Real Alloy has faced in the past, at the time of the filing of the RA Chapter 11 Case, and during the pendency of the Bankruptcy Proceedings may differ significantly from the risks that Real Alloy may face following emergence from the Bankruptcy Proceedings.\nReal Alloy suppliers may not be able to obtain sufficient credit insurance on Real Alloy, which could have a material adverse effect on Real Alloy\u2019s business and liquidity. Real Alloy purchases scrap aluminum and other goods and services from suppliers who may extend short-term credit to Real Alloy in the form of accounts receivables based on their ability to obtain credit insurance on Real Alloy. To the extent these suppliers are unable to obtain such insurance, they may be unwilling to extend credit to Real Alloy, thereby requiring payment from Real Alloy in advance or on delivery of products and services. Discussions and negotiations of trade terms are a regular matter with our suppliers, including those who do and do not use credit insurance, and because Real Alloy maintains hundreds of supply relationships, any change in terms for a single supplier generally does not impact the business, however, should multiple suppliers or credit insurers act at the same time, Real Alloy\u2019s liquidity, available capital, business and prospects could be adversely affected which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe cyclical nature of the metals industry, Real Alloy\u2019s end-use segments, and the industries of Real Alloy\u2019s customers could limit operating flexibility and could negatively affect Real Alloy\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. The metals industry is generally cyclical in nature. It tends to reflect and be amplified by changes in general macro and local economic conditions. These conditions include, but are not limited to, the level of economic growth, financing availability, the availability of affordable energy sources, employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence, and demand for automobiles and housing. Historically, in periods of recession or periods of minimal economic growth, metals companies have tended to underperform other sectors. Real Alloy is particularly sensitive to trends in the automobile industry, which can be seasonal, highly cyclical, and dependent upon general economic conditions. For example, during recessions or periods of low growth, the automobile industry typically experiences major cutbacks in production, resulting in decreased demand for inputs such as aluminum. This may lead to significant fluctuations in demand and pricing for Real Alloy\u2019s products and services. Because Real Alloy generally has certain fixed costs, its near-term profitability can be significantly affected by decreased processing volume. Accordingly, reduced demand and pricing pressures may significantly reduce its profitability and adversely affect its financial condition. Economic downturns in regional and global economies or a prolonged recession in its principal industry segments have had a negative impact on the operations of Real Alloy and could have a negative impact on Real Alloy\u2019s future financial condition or results of operations. In addition, global economic and commodity trends have been increasingly correlated in recent years. There can be no assurance that diversification will significantly mitigate the effect of cyclical downturns.\nReal Alloy requires substantial capital investments that it may be unable to fulfill. The loss of certain members of the management team of Real Alloy may have an adverse effect on its operating results. The operations of Real Alloy are capital intensive. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the amount was approximately $23.8 million, $30.8 million and $34.2 million, respectively, including $26.0 million spent under Real Industry\u2019s ownership in the year ended December 31, 2015. Real Alloy may not generate sufficient operating cash flows and its external financing sources may not be available in amounts sufficient to enable it to make anticipated capital expenditures, service or refinance indebtedness or fund other liquidity needs. If Real Alloy is unable to make upgrades or purchase new equipment, its financial condition and results of operations could be affected by higher maintenance costs, lower sales volumes due to the impact of reduced product quality, and other competitive influences.\nChanges in tariffs or other trade restrictions may increase our operating costs, and therefore decrease our gross margins. In March 2018, in connection with the findings of the U.S. Commerce Department under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, by Presidential Proclamation, the U.S. imposed tariffs of 10% on certain aluminum articles imported into the United States. Until May 1, 2018, there is a temporary exemption for products of Australia, Argentina, South Korea, Brazil and E.U.-member countries, and there are no assurances that this exemption will continue. Further, the U.S. government has indicated that tariffs may be amended in the case of countries with whom the U.S. has a \u201csecurity relationship.\u201d While unknown at this time, there are likely to be exclusions granted to the aluminum tariffs. Although these tariffs and other trade restrictions on imported aluminum, may have a positive impact on U.S. prime aluminum, primary based alloy and secondary based alloy producers, it is too early to determine the impact, if any, of any such action on our sales, competition and customers.\nAt the same time, certain of the materials on which we depend to produce our alloys are imported and may be subject to tariffs or other trade restrictions, which could increase our costs of production and pricing for such alloys. For example, silicon metal imported into the U.S. from China is currently subject to antidumping duties, and there is a pending U.S. International Trade Commission investigation into imports from four other countries. We are a significant purchaser of silicon metal in order to produce many of our specification alloys, and half of the silicon metal used in our U.S. and Canadian plants is sourced internationally. If tariffs or other restrictions were imposed, the costs of our alloy production may increase, and such increase may not be fully offset by our pricing. In such event, our gross margins may be reduced.\nReal Alloy may be unable to effectively manage its exposure to commodity price fluctuations, and its hedging activities may affect profitability in a changing metals price environment and subject its earnings to greater volatility from period-to-period. Significant increases in the price of primary aluminum, aluminum scrap, alloys, hardeners, commodity inputs, or energy would cause the cost of sales for Real Alloy to increase significantly and, if not offset by product price increases, would negatively affect its financial condition and results of operations. Real Alloy is a substantial consumer of raw materials, and by far the largest input cost in producing its goods is the cost of aluminum and aluminum scrap. In the case of buy/sell arrangements, customers pay for products based on the indexed prices or based on a fixed price. Under tolling arrangements, customers pay Real Alloy a processing fee. In general, Real Alloy uses these pricing mechanisms to pass changes in the price of aluminum and aluminum scrap, and, sometimes, energy, through to its customers. Buy/sell arrangements may require Real Alloy to purchase raw materials in future periods, exposing it to the risk that increased aluminum or energy prices will increase the cost of its products, thereby reducing or eliminating the margin Real Alloy receives when it delivers the product. These risks may be exacerbated by the failure of customers to pay for products on a timely basis, or at all.\nSimilarly, as Real Alloy maintains substantial quantities of raw material and finished goods inventories, significant decreases in the price of aluminum and aluminum scrap would reduce the realizable value of its inventory, negatively affecting its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a drop in aluminum prices between the date of purchase and the final settlement date on derivative contracts used to mitigate the risk of price fluctuations may require Real Alloy to post additional margin, which, in turn, can be a significant demand on liquidity.\nReal Alloy purchases and sells LME forwards, futures and options contracts to reduce its exposure to changes in aluminum prices in its European operations. The ability to realize the benefit of a hedging program is dependent upon factors beyond its control, such as counterparty risk, as well as its receiving timely payments from customers. The cost of energy used, however, is also substantial. In addition, at certain times, hedging options may be unavailable or not available on terms acceptable to Real Alloy. In certain scenarios when market price movements result in a decline in value of its current derivatives position, its mark-to-market expense may exceed its credit line and counterparties may request the posting of cash collateral. Despite the use of LME forwards, futures and options contracts, Real Alloy remains exposed to the variability in prices of aluminum scrap. While aluminum scrap is typically priced in relation to prevailing aluminum index prices (LME, Platts, Metal Bulletin, etc.), certain scrap types used in Real Alloy\u2019s operations are not highly correlated to an underlying index and, therefore, are not hedged. Aluminum scrap is also priced at a discount to selling prices. This discount is referred to in the industry as the \u201cscrap spread\u201d and fluctuates depending upon industry conditions. In addition, Real Alloy purchases forwards, futures or options contracts to reduce exposure to changes in natural gas prices. It does not account for forwards, futures, or options contracts as hedges of the underlying risks. As a result, unrealized gains and losses on these derivative financial instruments are reported in the consolidated statements of operations as current period earnings or loss. The inclusion of such unrealized gains and losses in earnings may produce significant period-to-period earnings volatility that is not necessarily reflective of underlying operating performance.\nReal Alloy may encounter increases in the cost, or limited availability, of raw materials and energy, which could cause the cost of sales to increase thereby reducing operating results and limiting operating flexibility. Real Alloy requires substantial amounts of raw materials and energy in its business, consisting principally of aluminum scrap, primary aluminum, alloys, and other materials, and natural gas and electricity. Any substantial increases in the cost of raw materials or energy could cause operating costs to increase and negatively affect Real Alloy\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nAluminum scrap, primary aluminum, and hardener prices are subject to significant cyclical price fluctuations. Metallics (primary aluminum metal, aluminum scrap, and aluminum dross) represent the largest component of cost of sales. Real Alloy purchases aluminum primarily from aluminum scrap dealers, primary aluminum producers and other intermediaries. Real Alloy has limited control over the price or availability of these supplies.\nThe availability and price of aluminum scrap depends on a number of factors outside of the control of Real Alloy, including general economic conditions, international demand for metallics and internal recycling activities by primary aluminum producers and other consumers of aluminum. Increased regional and global demand for aluminum scrap can have the effect of increasing the prices that Real Alloy pays for these raw materials thereby increasing the cost of sales. Real Alloy may not be able to adjust its selling prices to recover the increases in aluminum scrap prices. If aluminum scrap and dross prices were to increase significantly without a commensurate increase in the traded value of the primary metals or of the indices on which sales are made, the future financial condition and results of operations of Real Alloy could be affected by higher costs and lower profitability. In addition, a significant decrease in the pricing spread between aluminum scrap and primary aluminum could make recycling less attractive compared to primary production, and thereby reduce customer demand for Real Alloy\u2019s recycling services.\nAfter raw material and labor costs, energy represents the third largest component of the cost of sales. The price of natural gas, and therefore the costs, can be particularly volatile. Price and volatility can differ by global region based on supply and demand, political issues, and government regulation, among other things. As a result, Real Alloy\u2019s natural gas costs may fluctuate dramatically, and it may not be able to reduce the effect of higher natural gas costs on its cost of sales. If natural gas costs increase, Real Alloy\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Although Real Alloy attempts to mitigate volatility in natural gas costs through the use of hedging and the inclusion of price escalators and pass-through mechanisms, it may not be able to eliminate the effects of such cost volatility. Furthermore, in an effort to offset the effect of increasing costs, it may have also limited its potential benefit from declining costs.\nIf Real Alloy were to lose order volumes from any of its largest customers, its revenues, earnings, and cash flows could be reduced. Real Alloy is exposed to risks related to customer concentration. Its ten largest customers were responsible for approximately 53%, 46% and 58% of its volume invoiced for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, with no customer accounting for more than 10% in 2017, one customer accounting for approximately 12% in 2016, and one customer accounting for approximately 13% of those volumes in 2015. A loss of order volumes from, or a loss of industry share by, any major customer could negatively affect the financial condition and results of operations of Real Alloy by lowering sales volumes and lowering profitability. In addition, Real Alloy\u2019s strategy of having dedicated facilities and arrangements with customers subject it to the inherent risk of increased dependence on a single or a few customers with respect to these facilities. In such cases, the loss of such a customer, or the reduction of that customer\u2019s business at one or more of its facilities, could negatively affect its financial condition and results of operations, and Real Alloy may be unable to timely replace, or replace at all, lost order volumes. Certain Real Alloy customers have decided to reduce their dependence on single suppliers and have reduced the volume of their orders from Real Alloy. In addition, several of Real Alloy\u2019s customers have become involved in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings and have defaulted on their obligations to Real Alloy in the last ten years. Similar incidents in the future would adversely impact the financial condition and results of operations of Real Alloy.\nReal Alloy does not have long-term contractual arrangements with a substantial number of its customers, and sales volumes and revenues could be reduced if those customers switch their suppliers. A substantial amount of Real Alloy\u2019s volume is sold to customers under contractual arrangements of one year or less or on a purchase order basis. Customers may choose not to continue to purchase products and services from Real Alloy. Any significant loss of these customers or a significant reduction in their purchase orders could have a material negative impact on the sales volume and business of Real Alloy.\nReal Alloy may not be able to compete successfully in the industries it serves and secondary aluminum may become less competitive with alternative materials, which could reduce Real Alloy\u2019s share of industry sales, sales volumes, and selling prices. Aluminum competes with other materials such as steel, plastic, composite materials, and glass for various applications, and recycled aluminum may also compete with prime aluminum. Higher aluminum prices tend to make aluminum products less competitive with these alternative materials. Lower aluminum prices can make prime aluminum more attractive than secondary aluminum in certain applications.\nReal Alloy competes with other aluminum recyclers in segments that are highly fragmented and characterized by smaller, regional operators. The principal factors of competition in the aluminum recycling business include price, metal recovery rates, proximity to customers, customer service, molten metal delivery capability, environmental and safety regulatory compliance, and types of services offered. Many of Real Alloy\u2019s customers also have the capability to recycle scrap and may choose to bring more of their recycling volumes within their own operations.\nWith its international business, Real Alloy encounters the risk that non-U.S. governments could take actions to enhance local production or local ownership at its expense. Recently, there have been increased volumes of prime aluminum from China.\nAdditional competition could result in a reduced share of industry sales or reduced prices for Real Alloy\u2019s products and services, which could decrease revenues or reduce volumes, either of which could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nReal Alloy has been shaped by acquisitions, including the Beck Acquisition, and divestitures under former owners, and we will continue to evaluate future acquisitions and divestitures. Future acquisitions or divestitures may not be successful, which could adversely affect Real Alloy\u2019s financial condition. The future financial performance and success of Real Alloy will depend in part on its ability to successfully implement its business strategy on a stand-alone basis. Part of the business strategy for Real Alloy has been the opportunistic pursuit of strategic acquisitions and dispositions. However, there can be no assurance that any such growth efforts will be successful, or that if successful, Real Alloy will be able to effectively manage expanded or acquired operations. The ability of Real Alloy to achieve its expansion and acquisition needs and objectives and to effectively manage its growth depends on numerous risks commonly encountered in business combinations, including the following:\n\u00b7\nits ability to identify appropriate acquisition targets and to negotiate acceptable terms for their acquisition;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to integrate new businesses into Real Alloy\u2019s operations;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of capital on acceptable terms to finance acquisitions (including in light of the terms of the indebtedness incurred during the Bankruptcy Proceedings);\n\u00b7\nthe ability to generate the cost savings or synergies anticipated;\n\u00b7\nthe inaccurate assessment of undisclosed liabilities;\n\u00b7\nincreasing demands on Real Alloy\u2019s operational systems; and\n\u00b7\nthe amortization of acquired intangible assets.\nIn addition, the process of integrating new businesses could cause the interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of the existing Real Alloy business and the diversion of management\u2019s attention. Any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the integration of new businesses or divestiture of existing businesses could negatively impact Real Alloy and its results of operations. Furthermore, any acquisition could result in significant increases in outstanding indebtedness and debt service requirements. The terms of this indebtedness may further limit Real Alloy\u2019s ability to pursue acquisitions.\nFurther aluminum industry consolidation could impact Real Alloy. The aluminum industry has experienced consolidation over the past several years, and there may be further industry consolidation in the future. Although recent industry consolidation has not negatively impacted Real Alloy, further consolidation in the aluminum industry could possibly have negative impacts that we cannot reliably predict.\nA portion of Real Alloy\u2019s sales is derived from international operations, which exposes Real Alloy to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad. Real Alloy has aluminum recycling operations in Germany, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Norway and Canada and magnesium recycling operations in Germany. Real Alloy\u2019s international operations generally are subject to risks, including:\n\u00b7\nchanges in U.S. and foreign governmental regulations, trade restrictions and laws, including tax laws and regulations;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and trade control laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption laws in the United Kingdom and Germany, and export controls and economic sanction programs, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control;\n\u00b7\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u00b7\ntariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u00b7\nthe potential for nationalization of enterprises or government policies favoring local production;\n\u00b7\ninterest rate fluctuations;\n\u00b7\nhigh rates of inflation;\n\u00b7\ncurrency restrictions and limitations on repatriation of profits;\n\u00b7\ndiffering protections for intellectual property and enforcement thereof;\n\u00b7\ndivergent environmental laws and regulations; and\n\u00b7\npolitical, economic and social instability.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could cause costs to rise, limit growth opportunities or have a negative effect on Real Alloy\u2019s operations and ability to plan for future periods, and subject it to risks not generally prevalent in the U.S.\nThe financial condition and results of operations of some of the operating entities of Real Alloy are reported in local currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in its and Real Industry\u2019s consolidated financial statements. As a result, appreciation of U.S. dollars against these currencies, generally, may have a negative impact on reported revenues and operating profit, and the resulting accounts receivable, while depreciation of U.S. dollars against these currencies, generally, may have a positive effect on reported revenues and operating profit. In addition, a portion of the revenues generated by its international operations are denominated in U.S. dollars, while the majority of costs incurred are denominated in local currencies. As a result, appreciation in the U.S. dollar may have a positive impact on earnings while depreciation of the U.S. dollar may have a negative impact on earnings.\nCurrent environmental liabilities as well as the cost of compliance with, and liabilities under, health and safety laws could increase the operating costs of Real Alloy and negatively affect its financial condition and results of operations. Real Alloy\u2019s operations are subject to U.S. federal, state and local, and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations, which govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the remediation of contaminated sites, and employee health and safety. Future environmental regulations could impose stricter compliance requirements on the industries in which Real Alloy operates. Additional pollution control equipment, process changes, or other environmental control measures may be needed at some of its facilities to meet future requirements.\nReal Alloy\u2019s financial liability for contaminated property can include the cost of investigating and remediating contaminated soil or ground water, fines and penalties sought by environmental authorities, and damages arising out of personal injury, contaminated property and other toxic tort claims, as well as lost or impaired natural resources. Certain environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances joint and several, liability for certain kinds of matters, such that a person can be held liable without regard to fault for all of the costs of a matter even though others were also involved or responsible. Further, any future remedial requirements at currently owned or operated properties or adjacent areas could also result in significant liabilities. In addition, any failure by Real Alloy to operate within the requirements of applicable laws and regulations or environmental permits could lead to, among other things, a shutdown of a portion or all of a facility, which also could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nChanges in environmental requirements or changes in their enforcement could materially increase costs. For example, if salt cake, a by-product of aluminum recycling operations, were to become classified as a hazardous waste in the U.S., the costs to manage and dispose of it would increase and could result in significant increased expenditures.\nReal Alloy could experience labor disputes that could disrupt its business. Approximately 22% of Real Alloy employees in North America and substantially all of the employees located in Europe, where union membership is common, are represented by unions or equivalent bodies and are covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements that are subject to periodic renegotiation. Although Real Alloy believes they will successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements when the current agreements expire, these negotiations may not prove successful, may result in a significant increase in the cost of labor, or may break down and result in the disruption or cessation of its operations.\nNew government regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental issues may subject Real Alloy to significant new costs and restrictions on its operations. Climate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide, including recently announced, long-term greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments by the U.S. and China. Many scientists, legislators, and others attribute climate change to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. There are legislative and regulatory initiatives in various jurisdictions, including the European Union, which would institute a cap-and-trade system, covering various sectors of the economy, under which emitters would be required to buy allowances to offset emissions of greenhouse gas. In addition, several states, including states where Real Alloy has manufacturing plants, are considering greenhouse gas registration and reduction programs. Certain of these plants use significant amounts of energy, including electricity derived from various sources, and natural gas. Greenhouse gas or other clean air or environmental regulations could increase the price of the electricity and natural gas that Real Alloy purchases, restrict access to or the use of natural gas, require Real Alloy to purchase allowances to offset its emissions, prompt significant capital expenditures to mitigate emissions, or result in an overall increase in the cost of raw materials. Any one of these developments could significantly increase Real Alloy\u2019s costs, reduce its competitiveness in a global economy or otherwise negatively affect its business, operations or financial results. While future emissions regulation appears likely, it is too early to predict specifically how such regulation might affect Real Alloy\u2019s business, operations, or financial results.\nThe profitability of Real Alloy depends, in part, on the availability of an adequate source of raw materials. Real Alloy depends on aluminum scrap for its operations and acquires its aluminum scrap from numerous sources. These suppliers generally are not bound by long-term contracts and have no obligation to sell aluminum scrap to us. In periods of low industry prices, suppliers may elect to hold aluminum scrap waiting for higher prices. In addition, the slowdown in industrial production and consumer consumption in the U.S. and Europe during past economic crises may have reduced the supply of aluminum scrap available to Real Alloy. Further, exports of aluminum scrap out of North America and Europe can negatively impact availability and scrap spreads. If an adequate supply of aluminum scrap is not available, Real Alloy would be unable to recycle metals at desired volumes and its results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe operations of Real Alloy present significant risk of injury or death. It may be subject to claims that are not covered by or exceed its insurance. Because of the heavy industrial activities conducted at its facilities, there exists a risk of injury or death to employees and visitors of Real Alloy, notwithstanding the safety precautions taken. These operations are subject to regulation by various U.S. federal, state and local, and foreign agencies responsible for employee health and safety, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. While Real Alloy has policies in place to minimize such risks, it may nevertheless be unable to avoid material liabilities for any employee death or injury that may occur in the future. These types of incidents may not be covered by or may exceed insurance coverage and may have a material adverse effect on Real Alloy\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nRecent derivatives legislation could have an adverse impact on the ability to hedge risks associated with Real Alloy\u2019s operations and on the cost of its hedging activities. Real Alloy uses over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives products to hedge its metal commodity and natural gas risks and, historically, currency risks. Legislation in Europe and the U.S. has been adopted to increase the regulatory oversight of the OTC derivatives markets and impose restrictions on certain derivative transactions, which could affect the use of derivatives in hedging transactions. As a result of the regulation of the derivatives market under the Dodd-Frank Act, the parties with whom we enter into hedging transactions are subject to heightened requirements, and they could pass along their increased regulatory compliance burden in the form of higher costs or tighter the costs of hedging. Additional rules and regulations pursuant to this legislation are likely to be adopted and not all compliance dates have been reached. If future rules and regulations subject Real Alloy to additional capital or margin requirements, reduce the number of eligible derivatives counterparties, or impose other restrictions on its trading and commodity positions, they could have an adverse effect on the ability to hedge risks associated with Real Alloy and on the costs of its hedging activities.\nCertain German pension and benefit obligations of Real Alloy are currently underfunded. Real Alloy may have to make significant cash payments to certain German pension plans, which would reduce the cash available for its business and have an adverse effect on its business financial condition, results of operations, prospects and ability to satisfy its obligations under its indebtedness.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nIn connection with the RI Plan, existing common stockholders face substantial dilution. The RI Plan provides for our common stockholders, in the aggregate, to receive 16% of the outstanding equity in the reorganized Company, following confirmation and effectiveness of the RI Plan. This percentage increases to 20% if the common stockholders vote to approve the RI Plan. The sponsor of the RI Plan will purchase 49% of the equity of the reorganized company for $17.5 million, less the repayment of the RI DIP Financing Facility. The remaining 31% or 35% of the outstanding equity in Reorganized RELY will be issued to the holder of the Redeemable Preferred Stock, who has agreed, pursuant to a separate agreement with the Plan Sponsor, to support the RI Plan and accept reduced recovery on its mandatory redemption obligation, in order to secure the Company\u2019s emergence from the RI Chapter 11 Case.\nTrading in our securities during the pendency of our Chapter 11 Case is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. We expect that the existing common stock of the Company will be extinguished and, if the RI Plan, or a comparable plan, is not approved, existing equity holders may receive no value in respect of their equity interests. On the Petition Date, the Company received written notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq stating that in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5101, 5110(b) and IM-5101-1, Nasdaq had determined that the Company\u2019s common stock would be delisted from Nasdaq. On November 28, 2017, the Company\u2019s common stock was removed from listing and registration on Nasdaq and began trading on the OTC Pink Sheets under the symbol \u201cRELYQ\u201d thereafter. The delisting by the NASDAQ could result in significantly lower trading volumes and reduced liquidity for investors seeking to buy or sell shares of our common stock.\nThe RI Plan provides, among other things, that upon our emergence from bankruptcy, our existing common stock will be canceled, and the holders of our existing common stock will receive 16% of the newly issued equity in Reorganized RELY if they do not vote to accept the RI Plan as a class, with such percentage increasing to 20% if they vote to approve the RI Plan as a class. If the RI Plan is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, upon emergence, shares of Reorganized RELY\u2019s common stock may be subject to further dilution due to subsequent capital raising activities. Additionally, the RI Plan may not be confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, in which case, there is a material chance that the existing shareholders will receive little or no distribution in our Chapter 11 Case. Accordingly, any trading in shares of our common stock during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Case is highly speculative.\nFollowing our expected emergence from our Chapter 11 Case, there may not be an established market for shares of Reorganized RELY common stock, which means there are uncertainties regarding the prices and terms on which holders could dispose of their shares, if at all. No established market exists for the new common stock of Reorganized RELY (the \u201cReorganized RELY common stock\u201d) to be issued pursuant to the RI Plan. We cannot provide any assurance that the Reorganized RELY common stock will be publicly tradable at any time after the effective date of the RI Plan. If no public market for the Reorganized RELY common stock develops, holders of such common stock may have difficulty selling or obtaining timely and accurate quotations with respect to such securities. There cannot be any assurance as to the degree of price volatility or liquidity in any market that develops for the Reorganized RELY common stock.\nWe and our predecessors have not paid cash dividends since 2006 and do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We are a holding company that does not operate any business that is separate from those of our subsidiaries. We are therefore dependent on our subsidiaries for any funds from which to pay dividends. We and our predecessors have not paid a dividend on our common stock since the fourth quarter of 2006. As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases we are currently prohibited from paying dividends.\nOur Amended and Restated Bylaws and our Rights Agreement could discourage, delay, prevent, or deter takeover attempts and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock. Each of our Rights Agreement and the Tax Benefit Preservation Provisions of our Amended and Restated Bylaws contain provisions that were adopted to prevent an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Tax Code and thereby preserve our ability to utilize our U.S. NOLs. Each has the effect of limiting beneficial ownership of our common stock to 4.9% (5.0% in the case of our Rights Agreement) without approval of our Board of Directors. Such provisions may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a third-party from making an acquisition proposal for us, which may inhibit a change in control in circumstances that could give the holders of our common stock the opportunity to realize a premium over the market price for our common stock.\nIn connection with the RI Chapter 11 Case, the Company obtained additional protections for the NOLs. The trading order requires prior notice to the Bankruptcy Court of certain transfers of beneficial ownership in the Company\u2019s equity securities by persons who hold 4.5% of the outstanding common stock of the Company or any shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock, or by persons who would own over such levels upon such transfer. The trading order also imposes certain procedures on holders of 50% or more of any class of the Company\u2019s equity securities to report such status and to provide advance notice of planned tax deductions based on the worthlessness of such stock. This trading order serves to limit certain sales or purchases of the Company\u2019s common or preferred equity or other actions that could reduce or eliminate the value of any NOLs under existing Section 382 of the Tax Code. Any transfers of shares or declarations of worthlessness in violation of the procedures in the trading order are null and void ab initio. Under the currently contemplated RI Plan, a new Rights Agreement will be adopted on substantially the same terms as the current Rights Agreement, provided that it will be updated to refer to the shares of Reorganized RELY common stock.", "PERMNO": 37699, "SIC": 3341, "TIC": "ELLH"}
