{"cik": "1016169", "company": "ANTARES PHARMA, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe following \u201crisk factors\u201d contain important information about us and our business and should be read in their entirety. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or that we now believe to be not material could also impair our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer significantly. As a result, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all of your investment. In this Section, the terms the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cour\u201d and \u201cus\u201d refer to Antares Pharma, Inc.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe have incurred significant losses to date, and there is no guarantee that we will ever become profitable.\nWe incurred net losses of $24,338,804 and $20,658,846 in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, we had an accumulated deficit at December 31, 2016 of $253,445,306. The costs for research and development of our products, product candidates and drug delivery technologies, and certain product candidates of our partners, along with marketing and selling expenses and general and administrative expenses, have been the principal causes of our losses. We may not ever become profitable and if we do not become profitable your investment could be harmed.\nWe may need additional capital in the future in order to continue our operations.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $27,714,588 and no debt obligations. We believe the combination of our current cash and projected product sales, product development fees, license revenues, milestone payments and royalties should provide us with sufficient funds to meet our obligations and support operations through at least the first quarter of 2018. However, we have not historically generated, and do not currently generate, enough revenue or operating cash flow to support our operations, and continue to operate primarily by raising capital. We reported net losses of $24,338,804, $20,658,846 and $35,151,715 and negative cash flows from operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We have an accumulated deficit at December 31, 2016 of $253,445,306. We are exploring collaborations and potential financings to raise additional capital. If, however, we are not successful in raising additional cash, we may be required to defer or delay certain planned capital expenditures and other spending related to the potential approval and launch of QST, or curtail other controllable costs and discretionary spending for new research and development activities.\nIf we do obtain financing, we cannot assure that the amount or the terms of such financing will be as attractive as we may desire, and your equity interest in the company may be diluted. If we are unable to obtain financing when needed, or if the amount of such financing is not sufficient, it may be necessary for us to take significant cost saving measures or generate funding in ways that may negatively affect our business in the future. To reduce expenses, we may be forced to make personnel reductions or curtail or discontinue development programs. To generate funds, it may be necessary to monetize future royalty streams, sell intellectual property, divest of technology platforms or liquidate assets. However, there is no assurance that, if required, we will be able to generate sufficient funds or reduce spending to provide the required liquidity.\nLong-term capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the status of collaborative arrangements, the progress of research and development programs and the receipt of revenues from sales of products. Our ability to achieve and/or sustain profitable operations depends on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully market and sell OTREXUP\u00ae;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval for our own product candidates such as QST, and if approved, successfully commercialize the same;\n\u2022\nour and our partners\u2019 ability to obtain regulatory approval, and where applicable to obtain an AB-rating, of partnered products including VIBEX\u00ae epinephrine, multi dose pens for use with exenatide and teriparatide, the auto injector for AMAG\u2019s Makena\u00ae, and others;\n\u2022\nthe success of our partners in launching and selling new products such as VIBEX\u00ae Sumatriptan and selling our existing products;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully build commercial channels and sell future products if we choose not to partner the product;\n\u2022\nour ability to manufacture, or have manufactured, products efficiently, at the appropriate commercial scale, and with the required quality;\n\u2022\ntiming of our and our partners\u2019 development, regulatory and commercialization plans;\n\u2022\nthe demand for our technologies from current and future pharmaceutical partners;\n\u2022\nour ability to increase and continue to outsource manufacturing capacity to allow for new product introductions;\n\u2022\nthe level of product competition and of price competition;\n\u2022\npatient acceptance of our current and future products;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain reimbursement for our products from third-party payers;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop additional commercial applications for our products;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract and retain the right personnel to execute our plans;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, maintain or acquire patent positions;\n\u2022\nour ability to control costs; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions.\nWe launched OTREXUP\u00ae in February 2014 and as a company, we have limited sales and marketing experience.\nWe launched OTREXUP\u00ae in February 2014. Although we have hired highly qualified personnel with specialized expertise, as a company, we have limited experience commercializing pharmaceutical products on our own. In order to commercialize OTREXUP\u00ae, we have been building our sales, marketing, distribution, managerial and other non-technical capabilities and have made arrangements with third parties to perform these services when needed. In January 2015, we hired sales representatives and district managers to fill our 32 sales territories. Effective June 23, 2015, we regained the exclusive U.S. marketing rights to OTREXUP\u00ae for the treatment of psoriasis, after the LEO Pharma agreement was terminated for its exclusive right to commercialize OTREXUP\u00ae in the U.S. for this field. We have limited commercial resources and may incur incremental sales and marketing costs if we choose to market OTREXUP\u00ae for the treatment of psoriasis in the U.S. and may be unsuccessful in this commercial strategy. To the extent we rely on third parties to commercialize OTREXUP\u00ae in the future, we may receive less revenues or incur more expenses than if we had commercialized OTREXUP\u00ae ourselves. In addition, we may have limited control over the sales efforts of any third parties involved in our commercialization efforts. Regardless of whether we commercialize our products ourselves or rely on third parties, we will be responsible for compliance with FDA\u2019s laws and regulations concerning marketing and promotion. Should our employees or the employees of a third party fail to comply with these requirements, we may face regulatory enforcement action. If we are unable to successfully implement our commercial plans and drive adoption by patients and physicians of OTREXUP\u00ae through our sales, marketing and commercialization efforts then we may not be able to generate sustainable revenues from product sales which will have a material adverse effect on our business and future product opportunities. Similarly, we may not be successful in maintaining the necessary commercial infrastructure, including sales representatives, managed care, medical affairs and pharmacovigilance teams. The development of commercialization capabilities to market OTREXUP\u00ae has been and will continue to be expensive and time-consuming. As we continue to develop these capabilities, we will have to compete with other pharmaceutical companies to recruit, hire, train and retain sales and marketing personnel. If we have underestimated the necessary sales and marketing capabilities or have not established the necessary infrastructure to support successful commercialization, or if our efforts to do so take more time and expense than anticipated, our ability to market and sell OTREXUP\u00ae may be adversely affected.\nCommercialization of OTREXUP\u00ae requires significant resources, and if we do not achieve the sales expected, we may lose the substantial investment made in OTREXUP\u00ae.\nWe have made and are continuing to make substantial expenditures commercializing OTREXUP\u00ae. We have and expect to continue to devote substantial resources to establish and maintain a sales and marketing capability for OTREXUP\u00ae. If we are unsuccessful in our commercialization efforts and do not achieve the sales levels of OTREXUP\u00ae that we expect, we may be unable to recover the large investment we have made in research, development, manufacturing, inventory and marketing efforts, and our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on third parties to perform many necessary services for OTREXUP\u00ae, including services related to the distribution, invoicing, rebates and contract administration, storage and transportation of our products.\nWe have retained third-party service providers to perform a variety of functions related to the sale and distribution of our products, key aspects of which are out of our direct control. For example, we rely on Cardinal to provide key services related to logistics, warehousing and inventory management, distribution, contract administration and chargeback processing, accounts receivable management and call center management, and, as a result, most of our finished goods inventory is stored at a single warehouse maintained by the service provider. We place substantial reliance on this provider as well as other third-party providers that\nperform services for us, including entrusting our inventories of products to their care and handling. We rely on third parties to administer our drug price reporting rebate payments, and contracting obligations under federal programs; however, we are responsible for compliance with the program requirements. If our employees or these third-party service providers fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we and/or they may face regulatory enforcement action. Moreover, if these third-party service providers fail to meet expected deadlines, or otherwise do not carry out their contractual duties to us, or encounter physical damage or natural disaster at their facilities, our ability to deliver product to meet commercial demand would be significantly impaired. In addition, we utilize third parties to perform various other services for us relating to sample accountability and regulatory monitoring, including adverse event reporting, safety database management and other product maintenance services. If the quality or accuracy of the data maintained by these service providers is insufficient, our ability to continue to market our products could be jeopardized or we and/or they could be subject to regulatory sanctions. We do not currently have the internal capacity to perform these important commercial functions, and we may not be able to maintain commercial arrangements for these services on reasonable terms.\nWe rely on third party data providers to estimate patient prescriptions dispensed for OTREXUP\u00ae and help determine our revenue each reporting period.\nBecause we have limited sales history with OTREXUP\u00ae, we rely on third party data providers, such as Symphony Health Solutions, as a basis for estimating the number of patient prescriptions of OTREXUP\u00ae during each reporting period and use this information to calculate revenue for OTREXUP\u00ae. While we undertake certain procedures to review the reasonableness of this information, we cannot obtain absolute assurance regarding the accuracy of the prescription or market data or over the accounting methods and controls related to the information provided to us by third parties. If patient prescriptions dispensed for a given period are underestimated or overestimated, adjustments to revenue may be necessary. As a result, we are at risk of third parties providing us with erroneous data which could have a material adverse impact on our revenue reporting and our business.\nThe increase in the number of competitors targeting generic opportunities and seeking U.S. market exclusivity for generic versions of significant products may adversely affect our revenues and profits.\nOur ability to achieve continued growth and profitability through sales of generic pharmaceuticals is dependent on our and our partners\u2019 continued success in challenging patents, developing non-infringing products or developing products with increased complexity to provide opportunities with U.S. market exclusivity or limited competition.\nTo the extent that we or our partner succeed in being the first to market a generic version of a product, and particularly if we or our partner receives a 180-day period of exclusivity in the U.S. market, as a result of being the first applicant to submit a substantially complete ANDA with a paragraph IV certification and successfully launch the product as provided under the Hatch-Waxman Act, our and our partners\u2019 sales, profits and profitability can be substantially increased in the period following the introduction of such product and prior to a competitor\u2019s introduction of an equivalent product. Even after the exclusivity period ends, there is often continuing benefit for a time from having the first generic product in the market.\nSimilarly, to the extent we are able to receive exclusivity for our products approved through the 505(b)(2) pathway, our sales, profits, and profitability can be positively impacted. However, we may not be granted the periods of regulatory exclusivity that we anticipate, and if we do not receive such periods, we may be subject to ANDA and/or 505(b)(2) competition sooner than we anticipate.\nAdditionally, the number of generic manufacturers targeting significant new generic opportunities with Hatch-Waxman exclusivity, or which are complex to develop, continues to increase. Additionally, many of the smaller generic manufacturers have increased their capabilities, level of sophistication and development resources in recent years. Other companies may also be developing drugs using the 505(b)(2) pathway that are substantially similar to our products and/or product candidates. The failure to successfully develop and commercialize highly complex generic and 505(b)(2) products could adversely affect our sales and profitability. For instance, if another company receives the 180-day exclusivity period, FDA may not make our application effective during the first-to-file company\u2019s exclusivity period. This may prevent us from establishing a sufficient market share for our product. Similarly, should another company obtain FDA approval for a pharmaceutically equivalent product to one of our product candidates, we may no longer be able to use the 505(b)(2) pathway. In that case, it is the FDA\u2019s policy that the appropriate submission would be an ANDA. We may, however, not be able to immediately submit an ANDA or have an ANDA approval made effective, as we could be blocked by others\u2019 periods of patent and regulatory exclusivity protection.\nThe 180-day market exclusivity period is triggered by commercial marketing of the generic product or, in certain cases, by a final court decision holding the applicable patents to be invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. 180-day exclusivity may also be triggered by a settlement order or consent decree, or the withdrawal of the patent information by the reference listed drug sponsor. However, the exclusivity period can be forfeited by our failure to obtain tentative approval of our product or to launch a product within a specified statutory period. The Hatch-Waxman Act also contains other forfeiture provisions that may deprive the first \u201cParagraph IV\u201d filer of exclusivity if certain conditions are met, some of which may be outside our control. Accordingly, we may face\nthe risk that our exclusivity period is triggered or forfeited before we are able to commercialize a product and therefore may not be able to exploit a given exclusivity period for specific products.\nWe face intense competition from companies that have greater resources and capabilities.\nMany of our competitors are larger and have substantially longer experience in the development and marketing of innovative and specialty consumer-oriented products. They may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging market preferences or to devote greater resources to the development and marketing of new products and/or technologies than we can. As a result, any products and/or innovations that we develop may become obsolete or noncompetitive before we can recover the expenses incurred in connection with their development. In addition, for these product categories we must demonstrate to physicians, patients and third-party payors the benefits of our products relative to competing products that are often more familiar or otherwise better established. If competitors introduce new products or new variations on their existing products, our marketed products, even those protected by patents, may be replaced in the marketplace, we may never be able to establish a sufficient market share or we may be required to lower our prices.\nIn addition, our specialty pharmaceuticals business requires much greater use of a direct sales force than does our generic business. Our ability to realize significant revenues from direct marketing and sales activities depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified sales personnel. Competition for qualified sales personnel is intense. We may also need to enter into co-promotion, contract sales force or other such arrangements with third parties, for example, where our own direct sales force is not large enough or sufficiently well-aligned to achieve maximum penetration in the market. Any failure to attract or retain qualified sales personnel or to enter into third-party arrangements on favorable terms could prevent us from successfully maintaining current sales levels or commercializing new innovative and specialty products.\nWe depend on Teva to manufacture and supply the drug and to distribute and commercialize VIBEX\u00ae Sumatriptan in the U.S.\nWe have entered into a license, supply and distribution agreement with Teva to distribute VIBEX\u00ae Sumatriptan, an auto injector product containing sumatriptan for the treatment of migraines. Under our arrangement, we will manufacture the auto injector and do final assembly and packaging of the final product and Teva will manufacture and supply the drug sumatriptan and distribute and commercialize the product in the U.S. Teva also has an option for rights in other territories.\nThere is no guarantee that our partnership with Teva to distribute VIBEX\u00ae Sumatriptan will be successful. Teva controls the manufacture and supply of the drug, sumatriptan, which is necessary for the production of VIBEX\u00ae Sumatriptan. If, at any time, Teva ceases to manufacture and supply us with sumatriptan or fails to produce sufficient supplies of the drug, we will be unable to produce a finished product or sell our auto injectors designed for this product to Teva. In addition, if Teva is not able to produce sufficient supplies of the drug in accordance with cGMPs, we also will be unable to produce a finished product and we and/or Teva may be subject to regulatory enforcement action. We will also rely on Teva to commercialize and distribute the product within the U.S. and if Teva is unsuccessful in commercializing the product, the resulting revenue may be lower than expected. Additionally, we may disagree with Teva on certain business strategies or its manufacturing and distribution decisions. Such decisions by Teva may be beyond our control and may impact the success of VIBEX\u00ae Sumatriptan and we may receive less revenue than desired or expected. We have invested significant resources in the development of VIBEX\u00ae Sumatriptan, and, if our partnership with Teva is not profitable or is terminated for any reason, we may not receive a return on our investment and may suffer significant losses.\nIf we do not develop and maintain relationships with manufacturers of our and our partners\u2019 drug products or candidates, then we may be unable to successfully manufacture and sell our and our partners\u2019 pharmaceutical products.\nWe do not possess the facilities to manufacture commercial quantities of our drug/device combination product, including OTREXUP\u2122 and VIBEX\u00ae Sumatriptan, or any other of our or our partners\u2019 products or product candidates. We must contract with manufacturers to produce products and product candidates according to government regulations. The future development and delivery of our and our partners\u2019 products and product candidates depends on the timely, profitable and competitive performance of these manufacturers. A limited number of manufacturers exist which are capable of manufacturing our and our partners\u2019 products and product candidates. We and our partners may fail to contract with the necessary manufacturers or we and our partners may contract with manufacturers on terms that may not be favorable to us. We and/or our partners must obtain FDA approval for a product\u2019s or product candidate\u2019s manufacturing process and facilities, which we and/or our partners may never obtain or may not be able to maintain. If we or our partners are not able to obtain or maintain this approval, we and/or they would not be able to receive product approval, and commercialize and/or sell the applicable products. Moreover, should any manufacturer fail to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, we, our partners, and/or the manufacture may face regulatory consequences, including enforcement actions and/or product recalls. Additionally, use of contract manufacturers exposes us to risks in the manufacturer's business such as their potential inability to perform from a technical, operational or financial standpoint.\nIn addition, contract manufacturers may utilize their own technology, technology developed by us, technology developed by our partners, or technology acquired or licensed from third parties. When contract manufacturers develop proprietary process technology, our reliance on such contract manufacturers is increased. Technology transfer from the original contract manufacturer may be required. Any such technology transfer may also require transfer of requisite data for regulatory purposes, including information contained in a proprietary drug master file held by a contract manufacturer. We and/or our partners would be dependent on the contract manufacturer for the maintenance and right of reference to the drug master file. If the contract manufacture fails to maintain a drug master file or withdraws our or our partners\u2019 right of reference, we and/or our partners may no longer be able to manufacture, develop, market, and sell our or our partners\u2019 products or product candidates. FDA approval of the new manufacturer and manufacturing site, as well as certain changes to the manufacturing process, would also be required.\nWe have entered into multiple commercial supply agreements with third-party manufacturers, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nthe supply of the methotrexate drug substance;\n\u2022\nthe manufacture of prefillable syringes;\n\u2022\nthe manufacture of device components;\n\u2022\nthe production of the methotrexate drug substance and sumatriptan in pre-filled syringes;\n\u2022\nthe manufacture and partial assembly of VIBEX\u00ae auto injectors; and\n\u2022\nthe final assembly and packaging of our products and product candidates and our partners\u2019 products and product candidates.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured products ourselves, including:\n\u2022\nreliance on the third party for regulatory compliance, quality assurance and adequate training in management of manufacturing staff;\n\u2022\nthe possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control;\n\u2022\nfailure to supply adequate quantities of product or product candidates or failure to supply product or product candidates meeting the required product specification or other manufacturing requirements; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility of termination or non-renewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.\nWe and our partners depend on these third-party manufacturers to comply with cGMPs/QSRs enforced by the FDA and other regulatory requirements and to deliver materials on a timely basis. In addition, because regulatory approval to manufacture a drug is site-specific, the FDA and other regulatory authorities will repeatedly inspect our and our partners\u2019 current and future third-party manufacturers\u2019 facilities for compliance with cGMPs/QSRs. If we, our partners, or third-party manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may issue warning letters or suspend or withdraw our regulatory approval for approved or in-market products, refuse to approve any marketing applications, or refuse to allow future or current development of product candidates, among other things. Our third-party manufacturers may also fail to pass the audits by our or our partners\u2019 internal quality and regulatory group. Any of these actions could delay or prevent our development of products, delay or prevent the submission of these products for regulatory approval, delay or prevent marketing approval, or result in insufficient product or product candidate quantity to support commercial demand or development. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. See additional risk factors associated with manufacturing in the section \u201cRisks Related to Regulatory Matters.\u201d\nIn addition, we may consider entering into additional manufacturing arrangements with third party manufacturers. In each case, we will incur significant costs in obtaining the regulatory approvals and taking the other steps necessary to begin commercial production by these manufacturers.\nWe are dependent on numerous third parties in our supply chain for the commercial supply of our products and partners\u2019 products most of which are currently single source suppliers, and if any of these single-source suppliers are not able to satisfy demand and alternative sources are not available, the manufacturing and distribution of our products and our partners\u2019 products could be delayed and our business could be harmed.\nThe availability of our products for commercial sale depends upon our ability to procure the components, raw materials, packaging materials and finished products we need from third parties. We have entered into supply agreements with numerous third\nparty suppliers, many of which are currently our single source for the materials necessary for certain of our products. For example, we currently have the following single source suppliers in our supply chain for the commercial supply of OTREXUP\u00ae and Sumatriptan Injection USP:\n\u2022\nSupplier of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (\u201cAPI\u201d) for methotrexate;\n\u2022\nPharmascience for supply of commercial quantities of methotrexate pre-filled syringes;\n\u2022\nNypro for the supply of commercial quantities of the VIBEX\u00ae auto injectors;\n\u2022\nSharp for assembly and packaging of OTREXUP\u00ae and Sumatriptan Injection USP;\n\u2022\nCardinal for services related to logistics, warehousing and inventory management, distribution, contract administration and chargeback processing, accounts receivable management and call center management; and\n\u2022\nComDel for manufacturing services related to the sumatriptan auto injector.\nOur supplier for the pre-filled syringes of methotrexate and our supplier of methotrexate API are single source suppliers to us. If any of these manufacturers is unable to supply its respective component for any reason, including due to violations of the FDA\u2019s QSR or cGMP requirements, our ability to manufacture the finished OTREXUP\u00ae product will be adversely affected and our ability to meet the distribution requirements for any product sales of OTREXUP\u00ae and the resulting revenue therefrom will be negatively affected. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any failure in any part of our supply chain will not have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue from OTREXUP\u00ae or our other products which depend on third party suppliers, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nTo mitigate some of the short-term risk of relying on single source suppliers, we intend to build a safety stock of component and finished goods inventories. However, there can be no assurance that these inventories will be adequate or that we will be able to maintain our desired level of safety stock. Additionally, maintaining a high level of safety stock exposes us to additional risks such as excess and obsolete inventory if the sales volume of OTREXUP\u00ae or our other products do not meet our forecasts.\nIf we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate levels of coverage and reimbursement for OTREXUP\u00ae, or any of our other product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval, their commercial success may be severely hindered.\nSuccessful sales of our products depend on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Patients who are prescribed medicine for the treatment of their conditions generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors is critical to new product acceptance. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Assuming coverage is approved, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products.\nIn addition, the market for our products will depend significantly on access to third-party payors' drug formularies, or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. Increasingly, payors are looking for metrics and performance-based pricing to justify increased cost of therapeutic advancements.\nOur partnered products encounter similar issues in obtaining reimbursement from third-party payors. While we are unable to control the reimbursement rate or discounts contracted with third-party payors by our partners, these rates ultimately affect our profit sharing on Sumatriptan Injection USP with Teva and royalty payments on products such as Elestrin\u00ae and Gelnique\u00ae.\nThird-party payors, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In addition, in the U.S., no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor.\nFurther, we believe that future coverage and reimbursement will likely be subject to increased restrictions both in the U.S. and in international markets. Third-party coverage and reimbursement for OTREXUP\u00ae or any of our other product candidates for which\nwe may receive regulatory approval may not be available or adequate in either the U.S. or international markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may incur significant liability if it is determined that we are promoting or have in the past promoted the \u201coff-label\u201d use of drugs or medical devices.\nIn the U.S. and certain other jurisdictions, companies may not promote drugs or medical devices for \u201coff-label\u201d uses, that is, uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling and that differ from those that were approved or cleared by the FDA. Under what is known as the \u201cpractice of medicine,\u201d physicians and other healthcare practitioners may prescribe drug products and use medical devices for off-label or unapproved uses, and such uses are common across some medical specialties. Although the FDA does not regulate a physician\u2019s choice of medications, treatments or product uses, the FFDCA and FDA regulations significantly restrict permissible communications on the subject of off-label uses of drug products and medical devices by pharmaceutical and medical device companies. The FDA, the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS-OIG\u201d), the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and various state Attorneys General also actively enforce laws and regulations that prohibit the promotion of off-label uses. If the FDA determines that a company has improperly promoted a product \u201coff label\u201d or otherwise not in accordance with the agency\u2019s promotional requirements, the FDA may issue a warning letter or seek other enforcement action to limit or restrict certain promotional activities or materials or seek to have product withdrawn from the market or seize product, among other enforcement requirements. In addition, a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including civil fines, criminal fines and penalties, civil damages and exclusion from federal funded healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and/or government contracting, as well as potential liability under the federal False Claims Act and applicable state false claims acts. Conduct giving rise to such liability could also form the basis for private civil litigation by third-party payers or other persons allegedly harmed by such conduct.\nNotwithstanding the regulatory restrictions on off-label promotion, the FDA\u2019s regulations and judicial case law allow companies to engage in some forms of truthful, non-misleading, and non-promotional scientific speech concerning the off-label uses of their products. We have endeavored to establish and implement extensive compliance programs in order to instruct employees on complying with the relevant advertising and promotion legal requirements. Nonetheless, the FDA, HHS-OIG, the DOJ and/or the state Attorneys General, and qui tam relators may take the position that we are not in compliance with such requirements, and, if such non-compliance is proven, we may be subject to significant liability, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties and fines.\nThe failure of any of our third-party licensees to develop, obtain regulatory approvals for, market, distribute and sell their products as planned may result in us not meeting revenue and profit targets.\nWe partner with pharmaceutical companies, such as Teva, to develop, obtain regulatory approvals for, manufacture and sell our products and technologies along with their products. If one or more of these pharmaceutical company partners fail to pursue the development or marketing of our and our partners\u2019 products as planned, our revenues and profits may not reach expectations or may decline. We may not be able to control the timing and other aspects of the development of products because pharmaceutical company partners may have priorities that differ from ours. Therefore, commercialization of products under development may be delayed unexpectedly. The success of the marketing organizations of our pharmaceutical company partners, as well as the level of priority assigned to the marketing of the products by these entities, which may differ from our priorities, will determine the success of the products incorporating our technologies. Competition in this market could also force us to reduce the prices of our technologies below currently planned levels, which could adversely affect our revenues and future profitability.\nWe are currently working with Teva on four products: VIBEX\u00ae with epinephrine, VIBEX\u00ae with sumatriptan, and two pen products with exenatide and teriparatide. While VIBEX\u00ae with sumatriptan recently received FDA approval, there is no assurance that development of these products will continue or that the other three will receive FDA approval in a timely manner or at all, or if FDA approved they will be a significant revenue source for us. Additionally, we are currently working with AMAG to develop an auto injector for the subcutaneous administration of Makena\u00ae and there is no assurance that development of this product will continue or that it will receive FDA approval or, if FDA approved, that such product will be a significant revenue source for us. There is no assurance that AMAG will be able to submit an sNDA for Makena in a timely fashion or at all, or that FDA will accept the sNDA filing mechanism or approve the sNDA.\nWe currently depend on a limited number of customers for the majority of our revenue, and the loss of any one of these customers could substantially reduce our revenue and impact our liquidity\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we derived approximately 48% of our revenue from Teva and 12% from Ferring. In addition, we derive a significant portion of our product sales revenue from shipment of OTREXUP\u00ae to our distributors, including McKesson, which accounted for approximately 15% of total revenues in 2016.\nThe loss of any of these significant customers or partners or reduction in our business activities could cause our revenues to decrease significantly and increase our continuing losses from operations. If OTREXUP\u00ae is not successful and we cannot broaden our customer base, we will continue to depend on a few customers for the majority of our revenues. Additionally, if we are unable to negotiate favorable business terms with these customers in the future, our revenues and gross profits may be insufficient to allow us to achieve and/or sustain profitability or continue operations.\nNone of our significant license or collaboration agreements is perpetual in nature. Each has a specified termination date and may be terminated in advance of the termination date or renewal date by either party under different circumstances, for example a breach by us.\nMost of our total revenues are generated from a small number of products.\nWe generate product sales from a limited number of individual products. If we or our partners are unable to continue to market any one or a number of those products, such as OTREXUP\u00ae or our partnered device products, such as Sumatriptan Injection USP, then our total revenues, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. For example, if any of the products were to lose market share as the result of the entry of new competitors, or if the selling prices of any of these products were to decline significantly, there would be a direct negative impact on our reported revenues.\nWe are dependent on third parties to supply all raw materials used in our products and to provide services for certain core aspects of our business. Any interruption or failure by these suppliers, distributors and collaboration partners to meet their obligations pursuant to various agreements with us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe rely on third parties to supply all raw materials used in our products. In addition, we rely on third party suppliers, distributors and collaboration partners to provide services for certain core aspects of our business, including manufacturing, warehousing, distribution, customer service support, medical affairs services, clinical studies, sales and other technical and financial services. All third party suppliers and contractors are subject to U.S. laws and regulations, such as FDA requirements. Our business and financial viability are dependent on the continued supply by these third party suppliers, the regulatory compliance of these third parties, and on the strength, validity and terms of our various contracts with these third party manufacturers, distributors and collaboration partners. Any interruption or failure by our suppliers, distributors and collaboration partners to meet their obligations pursuant to various agreements with us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We and/or they may also be subject to regulatory action should we or they fail to comply with the applicable laws and regulations.\nWe have become more commercially oriented by further developing our own products and less dependent on our pharmaceutical partners, and we may not have sufficient resources to fully execute our plan.\nWe must make choices as to the drugs that we develop on our own. We may not make the correct choice of drug or technologies when combined with a drug, which may not be accepted by the marketplace as we expected or at all. FDA approval processes for the drugs and drugs with devices may be longer in time and/or more costly and/or require more extended clinical evaluation than anticipated. Funds required to bring our own products to market may be more than anticipated or may not be available at all. We have limited experience in bringing such products to market; therefore, we may experience difficulties in execution of development of internal product candidates.\nIf we do not develop and maintain relationships with manufacturers of our device products, then we may be unable to successfully manufacture and sell our device products.\nOur device manufacturing for our needle-free device has involved the assembly of products from machined stainless steel and composite components in limited quantities. Our device manufacturing for our VIBEX\u00ae auto injector for OTREXUP\u00ae and Sumatriptan Injection USP has involved high volume production of numerous complex parts as well as assembly of those parts. Our planned future device business may necessitate changes and additions to our contract manufacturing and assembly process or the use of a secondary manufacturer due to the anticipated larger scale of manufacturing in our business plan. Our devices must be manufactured in compliance with regulatory requirements, in a timely manner and in sufficient quantities while maintaining quality and acceptable manufacturing costs. In the course of these changes and additions to our manufacturing and production methods, we may encounter difficulties, including problems involving scale-up, yields, quality control and assurance, product reliability, manufacturing costs, existing and new equipment and component supplies, any of which could result in significant delays in production. We may also need to obtain FDA approval for any such changes, which may not be granted.\nWe rely on Nypro and Phillips to manufacture the pressure assisted auto injector device. Any failure by Nypro or Phillips, to successfully manufacture the pressure assisted auto injector device in commercial quantities, be in compliance with regulatory regulations, or pass the audits by our internal quality and regulatory group or pharmaceutical partner would have a negative impact on our future revenue expectations.\nWe use ComDel Innovation, Inc. and other third parties to manufacture certain parts for Sumatriptan Injection USP. Any failure by ComDel to successfully manufacture the device for Vibex sumatriptan in commercial quantities, be in compliance with regulatory regulations, or pass the audits by our internal quality and regulatory group or pharmaceutical partner would have a negative impact on our future revenue expectations.\nWe use Sharp for final assembly and packaging of many of our and our partners\u2019 products. Any failure by Sharp to successfully perform final assembly and packaging of our or our partners\u2019 products, or be in compliance with regulatory requirements, may result in product shipment delays and may have a negative impact on our product availability and future revenue expectations.\nMRP manufactures and assembles our needle-free devices and certain related disposable component parts for our partners Ferring and JCR. There can be no assurance that MRP will be able to continue to meet these regulatory requirements or our own quality control standards. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully produce and manufacture our products. Our pharmaceutical partners retain the right to audit the quality systems of our manufacturing partner, and there can be no assurance that MRP will be successful in these audits. Any of these failures would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We will also continue to outsource manufacturing of our future disposable injection products to third parties. Such products will be price sensitive and may be required to be manufactured in large quantities, and we have no assurance that this can be done. Additionally, use of contract manufacturers exposes us to risks in the manufacturers\u2019 business such as their potential inability to perform from a technical, operational or financial standpoint.\nWe rely on third parties to supply components for our products, and any failure to retain relationships with these third parties could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products and those of our third-party collaboration partners.\nCertain of our technologies contain a number of customized components manufactured by various third parties. Regulatory requirements applicable to manufacturing can make substitution of suppliers costly and time-consuming and may require regulatory approval. In the event that we could not obtain adequate quantities of these customized components from our suppliers, there can be no assurance that we would be able to access alternative sources of such components within a reasonable period of time, on acceptable terms or at all. The unavailability of adequate quantities, the inability to develop alternative sources, a reduction or interruption in supply or a significant increase in the price of components could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture and market our products.\nIf medical doctors do not prescribe our products or our partners\u2019 products, or the medical profession or patients do not accept our products or our partners\u2019 products, or managed care organizations do not cover our products or disadvantage them on their formularies, our ability to grow or maintain our revenues will be limited.\nOur business is dependent on market acceptance of our products and those of our partners by physicians, healthcare payors, patients and the medical community. Medical doctors\u2019 willingness to prescribe, and patients\u2019 willingness to accept, our products and those of our partners depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nperceived safety and efficacy of our products;\n\u2022\nconvenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nprevalence and severity of adverse side effects in both clinical trials and commercial use;\n\u2022\navailability of alternative treatments and perceived advantages/disadvantages;\n\u2022\ncost effectiveness;\n\u2022\nsubstitutability under state pharmacy laws, in the case of generic products;\n\u2022\neffectiveness of our marketing strategy and the pricing of our products;\n\u2022\npublicity concerning our products or competing products; and\n\u2022\nthird-party coverage or reimbursement for our products and those of our partners.\nEven though we have received regulatory approval for OTREXUP\u00ae and other products, and even if we receive regulatory approval and satisfy the above criteria for any of our product candidates, physicians may not prescribe, and patients may not accept, our products if we do not promote our products effectively. Factors that could affect our success in marketing our products include:\n\u2022\nthe adequacy and effectiveness of our sales force and that of any partners or international partner\u2019s sales force;\n\u2022\nthe adequacy and effectiveness of our production, distribution and marketing capabilities and those of our international partners;\n\u2022\nthe success of competing treatments or products, including generics; and\n\u2022\nthe availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payors for our products and those of our partners.\nIf any of our products or product candidates or those of our partners fails to achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to market and sell the products successfully, which would limit our ability to generate revenue and could harm our business.\nThe failure of our licensees to perform under any of our existing licensing agreements or the failure to enter into new licensing agreements could substantially affect our revenue.\nOne of our business strategies to reduce development risk is to enter into license agreements with pharmaceutical companies covering the development, manufacture, use and marketing of our drug delivery devices with specific drug therapies. Under these arrangements, the partners typically assist us in the development of the product and sponsor the collection of the appropriate data for submission for regulatory approval of the use of the drug delivery device with the licensed drug therapy. Our licensees may also be responsible for distribution and marketing of the product or technologies for these therapies either worldwide or in specific territories. We are currently a party to a number of such agreements, all of which are currently in varying stages of development. We may not be able to meet future milestones established in our agreements (such milestones generally being structured around satisfactory completion of certain phases of clinical development, regulatory approvals and commercialization of our product) and thus, would not receive the fees expected from such arrangements, related future royalties or product sales. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in executing additional collaborative agreements or that existing or future agreements will result in increased sales of our drug delivery technologies or products. In such event, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected, and our revenues and gross profits may be insufficient to allow us to achieve and/or sustain profitability. As a result of our collaborative agreements, we are dependent upon the development, data collection and marketing efforts of our licensees. The amount and timing of resources such licensees devote to these efforts are not within our control, and such licensees could make material decisions regarding these efforts that could adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations. In addition, factors that adversely impact the introduction and level of sales of any drug or drug device covered by such licensing arrangements, including competition within the pharmaceutical and medical device industries, the timing of regulatory or other approvals and intellectual property litigation, may also negatively affect sales of our drug delivery technology. We are relying on partners such as Teva, Ferring, and AMAG for future milestone, sales and royalty revenue. Any or all of these partners may never commercialize a product with our technologies, may be unsuccessful in commercializing a product, or significant delays in anticipated launches of these products may occur. For example, Teva submitted an amendment to the VIBEX\u00ae epinephrine pen ANDA in December 2014 and received a CRL from the FDA in February 2016 in which, according to Teva, the FDA identified certain major deficiencies. Due to the major nature of the CRL, Teva expects that its epinephrine product will be substantially delayed from their previously anticipated launch and that a launch, if any, will not take place before late 2017 or early 2018. There can be no assurances that the ANDA for the epinephrine pen will be approved by the FDA, or that the product will ultimately be launched. While we assist our partners in some cases in obtaining regulatory approvals and advancing new products, we depend on these partners and cannot control their decision-making or progress in achieving such goals. Any potential loss of anticipated future revenue could have an adverse effect on our business and the value of your investment.\nTiming and results of clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of products as well as the FDA\u2019s approval of products are uncertain.\nDrug development is an inherently risky and uncertain process. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the sale of any new product candidates, we and our partners must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that the product is safe and effective for each intended use. Preclinical and clinical studies may fail to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of a product. Likewise, we and our partners may not be able to demonstrate through clinical trials that a product candidate\u2019s therapeutic benefits outweigh its risks. Even promising results from preclinical and early clinical studies do not always accurately predict results in later, large scale trials. A failure to demonstrate safety and efficacy could or would result in the failure to obtain regulatory approvals.\nThe rate of patient enrollment sometimes delays completion of clinical studies. There is substantial competition to enroll patients in clinical trials and such competition has delayed clinical development of our products in the past. For example, patients may\nnot enroll in clinical trials at the rate expected or patients may drop out after enrolling in the trials or during the trials. Delays in planned patient enrollment can result in increased development costs and delays in regulatory approval. In addition, we rely on collaboration partners that may control or make changes in trial protocol and design enhancements, or encounter clinical trial compliance-related issues, which may also delay clinical trials. Product supplies may be delayed or be insufficient to treat the patients participating in the clinical trials, or manufacturers or suppliers may not meet the requirements of the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, such as those relating to cGMP. We and our partners may also experience delays in obtaining, or we and our partners may not obtain, required initial and continuing approval of our clinical trials from institutional review boards, FDA, or other applicable regulatory authorities. We cannot assure you that we or our partners will not experience delays or undesired results in these or any other clinical trials. Clinical trials may also be suspended, placed on hold, or terminated by us, institutional review boards, FDA, or other applicable regulatory authorities for a number of reasons, including failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, including GCPs, and issues involving subject safety.\nWe cannot assure you that the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies will approve, clear for marketing or certify any products developed by us or our partners, on a timely basis, if at all, or, if granted, that such approval will not subject the marketing of our products to certain limits or other costly and burdensome requirements. Such limits and requirements may include warnings, including black box warnings, limitations on the indicated use, including the applicable population, contraindications, Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, and post-approval studies and/or monitoring. The FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may not agree with the assessment by us or our clinical partners of the clinical data or they may interpret it differently. Such regulatory authorities may require additional or expanded clinical trials. Any limitation on use imposed by the FDA or delay in or failure to obtain FDA approvals or clearances of products developed by us and our partners would adversely affect the marketing of these products and our ability to generate product revenue, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approvals for certain generic products, we and our partners must conduct limited clinical or other trials to show comparability to the branded products. A failure to obtain satisfactory results in these trials would prevent us from obtaining required regulatory approvals.\nIf we are not able to establish new collaborations, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans.\nThe development and potential commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. For some of our product candidates, we may decide to partner with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of those product candidates.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaboration partners. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the partner\u2019s resources and experience, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed partner\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions generally. The partner may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available for collaboration and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate. We may also be restricted under future license agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms with potential partners. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future partners.\nWe may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market and generate product revenues. We may face competition from generic products, 505(b)(2) products, full NDA products, biologics, and biosimilars. Competition from generic and/or biosimilar products could result in lower cost products, which could lower our value proposition relative to that of costlier branded products and decrease the revenue we receive for our products.\nContinued consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry, and particularly in the generic pharmaceutical industry, could impact our existing partnerships, products and product candidates\nThere are a limited number of companies with sufficient scale and commercial reach to effectively market many of our products. Recent trends in the pharmaceutical industry suggest additional market consolidation, further concentrating financial, technical and market strength and resources and increasing competitive pressure in the industry. For example, in 2016 Teva completed its acquisition of the generic business of Allergan (formerly Actavis). We are presently working with Teva on four products, VIBEX\u00ae with epinephrine, Sumatriptan Injection USP, a pen product with exenatide, and a pen product with teriparatide. Acquisitions and integrations are time and resource intensive and Teva\u2019s attention and resources could be diverted to other acquisition or integration related activities or opportunities, which could potentially delay or negatively impact the success of some of our products with Teva. For other products, increased consolidation could lead to more intense competition and pricing pressure which could have a result in a substantial decrease in our revenues and harm our operating results. Consolidation may also lead to changes in personnel at our partners, potentially impacting the composition of our relationship teams at these partners and leading to material delays in the development and marketing of our products.\nAlthough we have applied for, and/or have received, several patents and trademarks, we may be unable to protect our intellectual property, which would negatively affect our ability to compete.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and enforce patents for our products and device technologies and to preserve our trade secrets and other proprietary information. If we cannot do so, our competitors may exploit our innovations and deprive us of the ability to realize revenues and profits from our developments.\nWe currently hold numerous patents and have numerous patent applications pending in the U.S. and other countries. Our current patents may not be valid or enforceable and may not protect us against competitors that challenge our patents, obtain their own patents that may have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business, or are able to otherwise circumvent our patents. Additionally, our products and technologies are complex and one patent may not be sufficient to protect our products where a series of patents may be needed. Further, we may not have the necessary financial resources to enforce or defend our patents or patent applications. Even issued patents may later be modified or declared invalid by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office by analogous foreign offices or in legal proceedings. In addition, any patent applications we may have made or may make relating to inventions for our actual or potential products and technologies may not result in patents being issued or may result in patents that provide insufficient or incomplete coverage for our inventions.\nTo protect our trade secrets and proprietary technologies and processes, we rely, in part, on confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and advisors. These agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets and other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure, or if others lawfully and independently develop the same or similar information.\nWe may seek to protect our patent rights by asserting an allegation of infringement against third parties. For instance, for any products approved via the NDA pathway, we will be required to submit certain patent information for inclusion in FDA\u2019s Orange Book. If third parties identify our products as reference listed drugs in any ANDA or 505(b)(2) applications, they will be required to provide patent certifications in their applications for our listed patents, and notifications to us. In the event such third parties make paragraph IV certifications, we would be entitled to file a patent infringement lawsuit, and if that is accomplished within 45 days after receiving the notification, it would trigger a 30-month stay against FDA making the approval of the third party\u2019s application effective. Patent litigation is costly and time consuming and the outcome is uncertain. There is no assurance of success with any patent litigation. Depending on the ultimate outcome of the litigation it may have an adverse effect on results of operations and our market penetration. For example, based on a Medac press release in January 2014, we became aware that Medac submitted an NDA to the FDA for an auto-pen containing methotrexate. On February 28, 2014, Antares sued Medac and its foreign parent, medac GmbH (together, \u201cMedac\u201d), in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement of two of the Company\u2019s patents for technology regarding an auto injector and an auto injector containing methotrexate. In April 2015, Antares, Medac, LEO Pharma, Inc. and LEO Pharm A/S entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which the proceedings related to Antares\u2019 patents, as well as patent claims filed by Medac against Antares, LEO Pharma and LEO Pharma A/S, were dismissed with prejudice (the \u201cMedac Settlement\u201d). The settlement agreement provides for a royalty-free cross-license under the patents named in the proceedings and their families allowing the manufacture and sale of OTREXUP\u00ae (methotrexate) injection and RASUVO\u00ae in and for the U.S.\nOthers may bring infringement claims against us, which could be time-consuming and expensive to defend and the outcomes uncertain.\nThird parties may claim that the manufacture, use or sale of our drug delivery technologies infringe their patent rights. As with any litigation where claims may be asserted, we may have to seek licenses, defend infringement actions or challenge the validity of\nthose patents in the patent office or the courts. If these are not resolved favorably, we may not be able to continue to develop and commercialize our product candidates. Even if we were able to obtain rights to a third party\u2019s intellectual property, these rights may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors potential access to the same intellectual property. If we are found liable for infringement or are not able to have these patents declared invalid or unenforceable, we may be liable for significant monetary damages, encounter significant delays in bringing products to market or be precluded from participating in the manufacture, use or sale of products or methods of drug delivery covered by patents of others. Any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. We may not have identified, or be able to identify in the future, U.S. or foreign patents that pose a risk of potential infringement claims. Ultimately, we may be unable to commercialize some of our product candidates as a result of patent infringement claims, which could potentially harm our business.\nAdditionally, we are developing and may develop other products in the future for ourselves and/or our partners using the ANDA and/or 505(b)(2) pathways. Our partners may also do the same. There can be no assurance that those products do not follow the same type of litigation process as the epinephrine case which could delay or prohibit the launch of those potential products. We may be exposed to, or threatened with, future litigation by third parties having patent or other intellectual property rights alleging that our partners\u2019 products and/or product candidates and/or proprietary technologies infringe their intellectual property rights, including litigation resulting from filing under Paragraph IV of the Hatch-Waxman Act. These lawsuits could claim that there are existing patent rights for such drug and this type of litigation can be costly and could adversely affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and technical personnel. There is a risk that a court would decide that we or our commercialization partners are infringing the third party\u2019s patents and would order us or our partners to stop the activities covered by the patents. In addition, there is a risk that a court will order us or our partners to pay the other party damages for having violated the other party\u2019s patents. Moreover, regardless of whether we and/or our partners are ultimately successful in defending a patent infringement suit, we and/or they may be significantly delayed by a 30 month stay in the event we and/or they make a paragraph IV certification.\nProduct liability and product recalls could harm our business.\nThe development, manufacture, testing, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products and medical devices are associated with significant risks of product liability claims or recalls. Side effects or adverse events known or reported to be associated with, or manufacturing defects in, the products sold by us could exacerbate a patient\u2019s condition, or could result in serious injury or impairments or even death. This could result in product liability claims and/or recalls of one or more of our products.\nProduct liability claims may be brought by individuals seeking relief for themselves, or by groups seeking to represent a class of injured patients. Further, third party payors, either individually or as a putative class, may bring actions seeking to recover monies spent on one of our products. While we have not had to defend against any product liability claims to date, as sales of our products increase, we may have product liability claims made against us. The risk of product liability claims may also increase if a company receives a warning letter from a regulatory or other enforcement agency. We cannot predict the frequency, outcome or cost to defend any such claims.\nProduct liability insurance coverage is expensive, can be difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. Our product liability insurance may not cover all of the future liabilities we might incur in connection with the development, manufacture or sale of our products. In addition, we may not continue to be able to obtain insurance on satisfactory terms or in adequate amounts.\nA successful claim or claims brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage could subject us to significant liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. Such claims could also harm our reputation and the reputation of our products, adversely affecting our ability to market our products successfully. In addition, defending a product liability lawsuit is expensive and can divert the attention of key employees from operating our business.\nProduct recalls may be issued at our discretion or at the discretion of our suppliers, government agencies and other entities that have regulatory authority for pharmaceutical and medical device sales. Any recall of our products could materially adversely affect our business by rendering us unable to sell that product for some time and by adversely affecting our reputation. A recall could also result in product liability claims by individuals and third party payors. In addition, product liability claims could result in an investigation of the safety or efficacy of our products, our manufacturing processes and facilities, or our marketing programs conducted by the FDA, the European Medicines Agency (\u201cEMA\u201d) or the authorities of the EU member states. Such investigations could also potentially lead to a recall of our products or more serious enforcement actions, limitations on the indications for which they may be used, or suspension, variation, or withdrawal of approval. Any such regulatory action by the FDA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the EU member states could lead to product liability lawsuits as well.\nIf we do not have adequate insurance for product liability or clinical trial claims, then we may be subject to significant expenses relating to these claims.\nOur business entails the risk of product liability and clinical trial claims. Although we have not experienced any material claims to date, any such claims could have a material adverse impact on our business. Insurance coverage is expensive and may be difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. We maintain product and clinical trial liability insurance and evaluate our insurance requirements on an ongoing basis. If we are subject to a product liability claim, our product liability insurance may not reimburse us, or may not be sufficient to reimburse us, for any expenses or losses that may have been suffered. A successful product liability claim against us, if not covered by, or if in excess of our product liability insurance, may require us to make significant compensation payments, which would be reflected as expenses on our statement of operations. Adverse claim experience for our products or licensed technologies or medical device, pharmaceutical or insurance industry trends may make it difficult for us to obtain product liability insurance or we may be forced to pay very high premiums, and there can be no assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Additionally, if the coverage limits of the product liability insurance are not adequate, a claim brought against us, whether covered by insurance or not, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to retain our key personnel, and continue to attract additional professional staff, we may be unable to maintain or expand our business.\nBecause of the specialized scientific nature of our business, our ability to develop products and to compete with our current and future competitors will remain highly dependent, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and commercial personnel. The loss of key scientific, technical and commercial personnel or the failure to recruit additional key scientific, technical and commercial personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. While we have employment agreements with our key executives, we cannot assure you that we will succeed in retaining personnel or their services under existing agreements. There is intense competition for qualified personnel in the areas of our activities, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of failures in our internal computer systems.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future partners, contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, attacks by computer hackers, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our manufacturing activities, development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of manufacturing records or clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential, protected helath or proprietary information, we could incur liability or damage to our reputation, and the further commercialization and development of our products and product candidates could be delayed.\nIf we make any acquisitions, we will incur a variety of costs and might never successfully integrate the acquired product or business into ours.\nWe might attempt to acquire products or businesses that we believe are a strategic complement to our business model. We might encounter operating difficulties and expenditures relating to integrating an acquired product or business. These acquisitions might require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business. In addition, we might never realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition. We might also make dilutive issuances of equity securities, incur debt or experience a decrease in cash available for our operations, or incur contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses relating to goodwill and other intangible assets, in connection with future acquisitions.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\nWe, or our licensees, may incur significant time and costs seeking approval for our products, which could delay the realization of revenue and, ultimately, decrease our revenues from such products.\nThe design, development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical compounds and medical devices are subject to regulation by governmental authorities, including the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries. The approval process is generally lengthy, expensive and subject to unanticipated delays. Currently we, along with our partners, are actively pursuing marketing approval for a number of products from regulatory authorities in other countries and anticipate seeking regulatory approval from the FDA for products developed internally and pursuant to our license agreements. In the future we, or our partners,\nmay need to seek approval for significant changes to existing products or for newly developed products. Our revenue and profit will depend, in part, on the successful introduction and marketing of some or all of such products by our partners or us.\nApplicants for FDA approval often must submit extensive clinical data and supporting information to the FDA. Varying interpretations of the data obtained from pre-clinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of a drug product. Changes in FDA approval policy during the development period, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted NDA also may cause delays or rejection of an approval. Even if the FDA approves a product, the approval may limit the uses or \u201cindications\u201d for which a product may be marketed, or may require further studies. The FDA also can withdraw product clearances and approvals for failure to comply with regulatory requirements or if unforeseen problems follow initial marketing.\nWe are developing our own combination products such as QST (testosterone) as well as injection devices for use with our partner\u2019s drugs. The regulatory path for approval of such combination products may be subject to review by several centers within the FDA and although precedent and guidance exists for the requirements for such combination products, there is no assurance that the FDA will not change what it requires or how it reviews such submissions. Human clinical testing may be required by the FDA in order to commercialize these products and devices and there can be no assurance that such trials will be successful. Such changes in review processes or the requirement for clinical studies could delay anticipated launch dates or be at a cost which makes launching the product or device cost prohibitive for ourselves or our partners. Such delay or failure to launch these products or devices could adversely affect our revenues and future profitability.\nAdditionally, based on the written recommendations from the FDA related to our clinical development program for QST, we launched a supplemental safety study QST-15-005 with additional participants, which we completed in 2016 in support of our NDA submission for QST. We believe that QST-15-005 should satisfy the FDA\u2019s previous recommendation that we create a larger safety base of subjects exposed to QST. However, the FDA may have additional recommendations or require further trials and the timing, cost and design of any such study could negatively affect our business if we incur significant costs or delays. Products of this nature often carry with them the need to monitor safety in an on-going manner, called a Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy, or REMS. The REMS for testosterone products is well-defined, and a class-labeling letter has been issued to all approved testosterone replacement products that will likely include being part of a clinical outcomes trial intended to explore cardiovascular risks.\nOur business and product development may also be adversely affected by the result and timing of the FDA\u2019s review of Teva\u2019s ANDA for its epinephrine product and exenatide and teriparatide pen products as we cannot market or sell our injector for use with these drug products in the U.S. until they have been approved by the FDA. Teva submitted an amendment to the VIBEX\u00ae epinephrine pen ANDA in December 2014 and received a CRL from the FDA in February 2016 in which, according to Teva, the FDA identified certain major deficiencies. Due to the major nature of the CRL, Teva expects that its epinephrine product will be substantially delayed from their previously anticipated launch date and that a launch, if any, will not take place before late 2017 or early 2018.\nIn other jurisdictions, we, and the pharmaceutical companies with whom we are developing technologies (both drugs and devices), must obtain required regulatory approvals from regulatory agencies and comply with extensive regulations regarding safety and quality. If approvals to market the products are delayed, if we fail to receive these approvals, or if we lose previously received approvals, our revenues may not materialize or may decline. We may not be able to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals. Additionally, clinical data that we generate or obtain from partners from FDA regulatory filings may not be sufficient for regulatory filings in other jurisdictions and we may be required to incur significant costs in obtaining those regulatory approvals.\nOur failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, regulatory approvals may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nQST and our other products and product candidates are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation by the FDA and other foreign regulatory agencies. The FDA regulates the research, development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, record keeping, reporting, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, import and export of pharmaceutical and medical device products. Failure to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements may, either before or after product approval, subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions.\nIn the United States, the FDA regulates drug and device products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), and its implementing regulations. QST, as well as other of our products and product candidates are subject to regulation by the FDA as combination products, which means they are composed of both a drug product and device product. If marketed individually, each component would therefore be subject to different regulatory pathways and reviewed by different centers within the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to a center that will have primary jurisdiction over its pre-market review and regulation based on a determination of the product\u2019s primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. In the case of QST and our other products and product candidates, the primary mode of action is attributable to the drug component of the product, which means that the Center of Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) has primary jurisdiction over\nits pre-market development and review. Following product approval, however, our products may be subject to regulation under FDA\u2019s drug and device requirements.\nWe are not permitted to market our product candidates, including QST, in the United States unless and until we obtain regulatory approval from the FDA. To market the product in the United States, we must submit to the FDA and obtain FDA approval of a marketing application. We have historically used FDA\u2019s 505(b)(2) NDA and ANDA pathways as further described in the Government Regulation Section. A 505(b)(2) NDA must be supported by extensive clinical and preclinical data, as well as extensive information regarding chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the applicable product candidate. An ANDA must be supported by studies demonstrating that the product candidate is bioequivalent to the reference listed drug, as well as extensive information regarding CMC. The number and types of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required varies depending on the product candidate, the approval pathway, the disease or condition that the product candidate is designed to target and the regulations applicable to any particular product candidate.\nDespite the time and expense associated with preclinical and clinical studies, failure can occur at any stage, and we could encounter problems that cause us to repeat or perform additional preclinical studies, CMC studies or clinical trials. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates, including, failure to receive FDA or IRB authorization to begin a trial, negative or inconclusive results, slow or insufficient subject enrollment, failure to obtain adequate clinical supply of product candidates, and failure by us, our partners, Contract Research Organizations, and clinical trial sites to follow the applicable regulatory requirements, including GCPs. The FDA and similar foreign authorities could also delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including because they:\n\u2022\nmay not deem a product candidate to be adequately safe and effective;\n\u2022\nmay not find the data from preclinical studies, CMC studies and clinical trials to be sufficient to support a claim of safety and efficacy;\n\u2022\nmay interpret data from preclinical studies, CMC studies and clinical trials significantly differently than we do;\n\u2022\nmay not approve the manufacturing processes or facilities associated with our product candidates;\n\u2022\nmay not agree with the pathway that we have chosen for our product candidates, requiring us to pursue more difficult approval pathways, including full NDAs;\n\u2022\nmay find that our reliance on a reference listed drug for an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application or literature for a 505(b)(2) application is not appropriate;\n\u2022\nmay not agree with the design and/or implementation of our clinical and/or pre-clinical studies;\n\u2022\nmay require us to conduct additional clinical and/or pre-clinical studies;\n\u2022\nmay change approval policies (including with respect to our product candidates\u2019 class of drugs) or adopt new regulations; or\n\u2022\nmay not accept a submission due to, among other reasons, the content or formatting of the submission.\nSignificant delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow competitors, to bring products to market before we do.\nAdditionally, based on the written recommendations from the FDA related to our clinical development program for QST, we launched a supplemental safety study QST-15-005 with additional participants, which we completed in 2016 in support of our NDA submission for QST. We believe that QST-15-005 should satisfy the FDA\u2019s previous recommendation that we create a larger safety base of subjects exposed to QST. However, the FDA may have additional recommendations or require further trials and the timing, cost and design of any such study could negatively affect our business if we incur significant costs or delays. Products of this nature may carry with them the need to monitor safety in an on-going manner, called a Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy, or REMS. The REMS for testosterone products is well-defined, and a class-labeling letter has been issued to all approved testosterone replacement products that will likely include being part of a clinical outcomes trial intended to explore cardiovascular risks.\nUndesirable side effects caused by any product candidate that we develop, a lack of bioequivalence for ANDA product candidates, and/or an inability to demonstrate product candidate efficacy could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications or cause us to evaluate the future of our development programs.\nUndesirable side effects could also interrupt, delay, or halt clinical trials. The regulatory review and approval process is lengthy, expensive and inherently uncertain.\nIn December 2016, we submitted the QST NDA which was accepted for filing by FDA in February 2017. Failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, regulatory approvals may:\n\u2022\nadversely affect the commercialization of the current version of QST or any products that we develop in the future;\n\u2022\nadversely affect the commercialization of the current version of QST or any products that we develop in the future;\n\u2022\nimpose additional costs on us;\n\u2022\ndiminish any competitive advantages that may be attained; and\n\u2022\nadversely affect our ability to generate revenues.\nWe may never receive approval for certain of our product candidates, and even if our product candidates are approved, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the products may be marketed, distribution restrictions, or to other conditions of approval; may contain significant safety warnings, including boxed warnings, contraindications, and precautions; may not be approved with label statements necessary or desirable for successful commercialization; or may contain requirements for costly post-market testing and surveillance or other requirements, including REMS, to monitor the safety or efficacy of the products. Moreover, any future actions or inquiries by the FDA with respect to the reference listed drug may require that we make changes to our labeling or, possibly, withdraw the product from the market. Any of the foregoing may impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations.\nThe 505(b)(2) and 505(j) (ANDA) regulatory pathway for many of our potential products is uncertain and could result in unexpected costs and delays of approvals.\nDrug/device combination products indicated for the treatment of systemic or local conditions, respectively, are regulated by the FDA in the U.S. and other similar regulatory agencies in other countries as drug products. Drug/device combination products may not be marketed in the U.S. until they have been demonstrated to be safe and effective. The regulatory approval routes for drug/device combination products include the filing of an NDA for new drugs, new indications of approved drugs or new dosage forms of approved drugs. Alternatively, these dosage forms can obtain marketing approval as a filing under Section 505(b)(2) where there is an acceptable reference product or as a generic product by the filing of an ANDA, provided the new generic product is bioequivalent to and has the same labeling as a comparable approved product. The combination of the drug, its dosage form and label claims and FDA requirements will ultimately determine which regulatory approval route will be required.\nMany of our and our partners\u2019 drug/device combination product candidates may be developed via the 505(b)(2) or the ANDA route. Both the 505(b)(2) and ANDA regulatory pathways are continually evolving and advice provided in the present is based on current standards, which may or may not be applicable when we or our partner potentially submit an NDA or an ANDA. Additionally, it is customary to reference the most similar predicate products when submitting a 505(b)(2) or ANDA application in order to potentially reduce testing requirements. However, it is important to know that:\n\u2022\nshould a more appropriate reference product(s) be approved by the FDA at any time before or during the review of our or our partners\u2019 NDA, we or our partner would be required to submit a new application referencing the more appropriate product; and\n\u2022\nthe FDA cannot disclose whether such predicate product(s) is under development or has been submitted at any time during another company\u2019s review cycle.\nDrug delivery systems such as injectors are reviewed by the FDA and may be legally marketed as a medical device or may be evaluated as part of the drug approval process. Combination drug/device products raise unique scientific, technical and regulatory issues. The FDA has established the Office of Combination Products (\u201cOCP\u201d) to address the challenges associated with the review and regulation of combination products. The OCP assists in determining strategies for the approval of drug/delivery combinations and assuring agreement within the FDA on review responsibilities. We may seek approval for a product including an injector and a generic pharmaceutical by filing an ANDA claiming bioequivalence and the same labeling as a comparable referenced product or as a filing under Section 505(b)(2) if there is an acceptable reference product. In reviewing the ANDA filing, the agency may decide that the unique nature of combination products allows them to dispute the claims of bioequivalence and/or same labeling resulting in our re-filing the application under Section 505(b)(2). If such combination products require filing under Section 505(b)(2) we may incur delays in product approval and may incur additional costs associated with testing including clinical trials. The result of an approval for a combination product under Section 505(b)(2) may result in additional selling expenses and a decrease in market acceptance due\nto the lack of substitutability by pharmacies or formularies. In addition, approval under the 505(b)(2) or ANDA regulatory pathway is not a guarantee of an exclusive position for the approved product in the marketplace.\nIf the use of our injection devices require additions to or modifications of the drug labeling regulated by the FDA, the review of this labeling may be undertaken by the FDA\u2019s Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology (\u201cOSE\u201d). Additionally, the instructions for use (\u201cIFU\u201d) for a device in a drug/device combination product are also reviewed for accuracy, ease of use and educational requirements. These reviews could increase the time needed for review completion of a successful application and may require additional studies, such as usage studies, to establish the validity of the instructions. Such reviews and requirement may extend the time necessary for the approval of drug-device combinations. Such was the case for the approval of our needle-free device for use with hGH. The approval process took much more time than contemplated.\nAccordingly, these regulations and the FDA\u2019s interpretation of them might impair our ability to obtain product approval in a reasonable time, or at all, or effectively market our products.\nNDAs submitted under Section 505(b)(2) and ANDAs subjects us to the risk that we may be subject to a patent infringement lawsuit or regulatory actions that would delay or prevent the review or approval of our product candidate.\nApplicants submitting NDAs under Section 505(b)(2) of the FFDCA and ANDA applicants must provide a patent certification with their applications. One such certification is known as a Paragraph IV certification, which certifies that any patents listed in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book are invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of the product that is the subject of the application. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the holder of patents or the reference listed drug applications that the new application references may file a patent infringement lawsuit following a Paragraph IV certification, triggering a 30-month stay. In such a case, the FDA may not make the application approval effective until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the notice of the Paragraph IV certification, the expiration of the patent, when the infringement case concerning each such patent is favorably decided in the applicant\u2019s favor or settled, or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. Accordingly, we may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of one or more product candidates only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before such product candidates may be commercialized, if at all.\nIn addition, a 505(b)(2) or ANDA application approval will not be made effective until any existing non-patent exclusivity have expired or, if possible, are carved out from the label.\nWe are subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense for our approved products. Failure to comply with these obligations could result in regulatory and/or legal consequences.\nOur approved products are subject to extensive and ongoing requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, including requirements related to the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, recordkeeping, export, import, advertising, marketing, and promotional activities for such product. These requirements further include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information, including manufacturing deviations and reports; registration and listing requirements; the payment of user fees; requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping; and GCPs, for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. The FDA\u2019s policies may also change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit, or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates or products, or that could impose additional regulatory obligations on us.\nBy example, we and our partners also must comply with FDA\u2019s promotional requirements, including FDA\u2019s prohibition on the promotion of products for unapproved uses. Promotional communications may receive significant attention and scrutiny from not only the FDA but also the Department of Justice, Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Inspector General, state attorneys general, members of Congress, and the public.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or that the drug is less effective than previously thought or other problems with our products, manufacturers, or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements both before and after approval, may yield various results, including manufacturing and distribution restrictions, changes to product labeling, post-marketing study or other requirements such as REMS, refusal to approve marketing applications or supplements, withdrawal of marketing application approvals, product recalls, fines, penalties, FDA debarment, debarment from government contracts, and exclusion from federal healthcare programs. Any of these events could have other material and adverse effects on our operations and business.\nAny relationships with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers (actual and potential) and third-party payors in connection with our current and future business activities are and will continue to be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, marketing expenditure tracking and disclosure (or \u201csunshine\u201d) laws, government price reporting, and health information privacy and security laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings.\nOur business operations and activities may be directly, or indirectly, subject to various federal, state and local fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act. These laws may impact, among other things, our current activities with principal investigators and research subjects, as well as proposed and future sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by the federal government, state governments and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute (\u201cAKS\u201d), which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, the referral of an individual for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service, or the purchase, lease, order, arrangement for, or recommendation of the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, except for activities protected by narrowly-drawn statutory and regulatory safe harbors. Remuneration alleged to induce prescribing practices, reimbursement or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if it does not qualify for a safe harbor. The AKS has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and beneficiaries. Actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it is not needed to establish liability, and a violation of the AKS may be grounds for a government or whistleblower claim under the federal civil False Claims Act;\n\u2022\nthe civil federal False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent; knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government; conspiring to defraud the government by getting a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government; or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The FCA authorizes imposition of treble damages and a civil penalty for each false claim submitted;\n\u2022\nthe criminal federal False Claims Act, which imposes criminal fines or imprisonment against individuals or entities who make or present a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious or fraudulent;\n\u2022\nthe civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent For violations after November 2, 2015, the penalty has increased from a minimum of $5,500 to $10,781, and a maximum of $11,000 to $21,563;\n\u2022\nthe Veterans Health Care Act (\u201cVHCA\u201d) of 1992 that requires manufacturers of \u201ccovered drugs\u201d to enter into a Master Agreement and Federal Supply Schedule contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs through which their covered drugs must be offered for sale at a mandatory ceiling price to certain federal agencies, including but not limited to, the Department of Veterans Affairs, on the Federal Supply Schedule, which requires compliance with applicable federal procurement laws and regulations and subjects manufacturers to contractual remedies as well as administrative, civil and criminal sanctions. The VHCA also requires manufacturers to enter into pricing agreements with the Department of Health and Human Services to charge no more than a different ceiling price to covered entities, and failure to provide the mandatory discount may subject the manufacturer to specific civil monetary penalties;\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private), knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization, including mandatory contractual terms as well as directly applicable privacy and security standards and requirements;\n\u2022\nthe federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, created under the PPACA, and its implementing regulations requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the United States Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members, with data collection and reporting to CMS required by 90th day of each calendar year;\n\u2022\nfederal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;\n\u2022\nfederal government price reporting laws, changed by the PPACA to, among other things, increase the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and offer such rebates to additional populations, that require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs, where such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and/or discounts on our marketed drugs. Participation in these programs and compliance with the applicable requirements may subject us to potentially significant discounts on our products, increased infrastructure costs and potentially limit our ability to offer certain marketplace discounts and failure to report accurate pricing information exposes us to federal False Claims Act liability;\n\u2022\nthe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a U.S. law which regulates certain financial relationships with foreign government officials (which could include, for example, certain medical professionals);\n\u2022\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback, false claims, consumer protection and unfair competition laws which may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements as well as submitting claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payors, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government that otherwise restricts payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state laws that require drug manufacturers to file reports with states regarding marketing information, such as the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensations and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities (compliance with such requirements may require investment in infrastructure to ensure that tracking is performed properly, and some of these laws result in the public disclosure of various types of payments and relationships, which could potentially have a negative effect on our business and/or increase enforcement scrutiny of our activities); and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, with differing effects; and\n\u2022\nthe Drug Supply Chain Security Act of 2013 imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing, and will be implemented over a 10-year period. Among the requirements of this legislation, manufacturers are required to provide certain information regarding the drug products to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, will be required to label drug product with a product identifier, and are required to keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Manufacturers are also required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers' products are appropriately licensed. Further, manufactures have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and FDA and trading partner notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products that would result in serious adverse health consequences or death to humans, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. Similar requirements are also imposed on other trading partners in the supply chain.\nChanges in healthcare law and implementing regulations, including those based on recently enacted legislation, as well as changes in healthcare policy, may impact our business in ways that we cannot currently predict and these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together \u201cthe Healthcare Reform Act\u201d), is a sweeping measure intended to expand healthcare coverage within the United States, primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals and expansion of the Medicaid program. This law substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Healthcare Reform Act contains a number of provisions that are expected to impact our business and operations, in some cases in ways we cannot currently predict. Changes that may affect our business include those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, benefits for patients within a coverage gap in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program (commonly known as the \u201cdonut hole\u201d), rules regarding prescription drug benefits under the health insurance exchanges, changes to the Medicare Drug Rebate program, expansion of the Public Health Service\u2019s 340B drug pricing discount program, fraud and abuse and enforcement. These changes will impact existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program.\nSome states have elected not to expand their Medicaid programs by raising the income limit to 133% of the federal poverty level, as is permitted under the Healthcare Reform Act. For each state that does not choose to expand its Medicaid program, there may be fewer insured patients overall, which could impact our sales, business and financial condition. Where Medicaid patients receive insurance coverage under any of the new options made available through the Healthcare Reform Act, the possibility exists that manufacturers may be required to pay Medicaid rebates on drugs used under these circumstances, a decision that could impact manufacturer revenues. In addition, the federal government has also announced delays in the implementation of key provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act, including the employer mandate. The implications of these delays for our sales, business and financial condition, if any, are not yet clear.\nMoreover, legislative changes to the Healthcare Reform Act remain possible. We expect that the Healthcare Reform Act, as currently enacted or as it may be amended in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of our existing products or to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved. In addition to the Healthcare Reform Act, there will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and third party payors to keep healthcare costs down while expanding individual healthcare benefits.\nTo help patients afford our product OTREXUP\u00ae, we offer discount, rebate and co-pay coupon programs. Co-pay coupon programs have received some negative publicity related to their use to promote branded pharmaceutical products over other less costly alternatives. In recent years, other pharmaceutical manufacturers have been named in class action lawsuits challenging the legality of their co-pay programs under a variety of federal and state laws. In addition, at least one insurer has directed its network pharmacies to no longer accept co-pay coupons for certain specialty drugs the insurer identified. Our co-pay coupon programs could become the target of similar lawsuits or insurer actions. It is possible that the outcome of litigation against other manufacturers, changes in insurer policies regarding co-pay coupons, and/or the introduction and enactment of new legislation or regulatory action could restrict or otherwise negatively affect these programs.\nWe are dependent on third parties to decide to utilize our and our partners\u2019 products to make them readily available at the point of care throughout their networks of pharmacies.\nIn addition to extensive internal efforts, the successful commercialization of our and our partners\u2019 products require many third parties, over whom we have no control, to decide to utilize them, and to make them readily available at the point of care throughout their networks of pharmacies. These third parties include HMOs, long term care facilities, and pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, which use pharmacy and therapeutics committees, commonly referred to as P&T committees, to make purchasing and reimbursement decisions. Generally, before an HMO or long-term care facility will acquire a product for its own pharmacies, or a PBM will pay retail network pharmacies on behalf of its health plans, the product must be approved for addition to that organization\u2019s list of approved drugs, or formulary list, by the organization\u2019s P&T committee. An institutional P&T committee typically governs all matters pertaining to the use of medications within the institution, including review of medication formulary data and recommendations for the appropriate use of drugs within the institution to the medical staff. PBM P&T committees develop the criteria for plan beneficiaries to access prescription medication, including such cost control measures as step therapy and prior authorization. The frequency of P&T committee meetings varies considerably, and P&T committees often require additional information to aid in their decision-making process, so we may experience substantial delays in obtaining formulary approvals. Additionally, P&T committees may be concerned that the cost of acquiring a product for use in their institutions or reimbursing retail pharmacies outweighs clinical benefits and will resist efforts to add the product to the formulary, or implement restrictions on the usage of the drug in order to\ncontrol costs. We cannot guarantee that we and/or our partners will be successful in getting the approvals we need from enough P&T committees quickly enough to maintain and grow sales of our or our partners\u2019 products.\nOur products or product candidates may be subject to restrictive marketing and distribution requirements, which if applied to our product candidates would restrict their use and harm our ability to generate profits.\nSome of the currently approved testosterone products are subject to a REMS program. REMS programs may require medication guides, special communication plans to healthcare professionals, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, distribution only to certain medical professionals, training for medical professionals prescribing, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. The FDA may determine that QST or other products or product candidates require a REMS program. We cannot predict whether REMS will be required as part of the FDA\u2019s approval of our product candidates or whether such REMS would be required following approval, and, if required, what those requirements might be. Any limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial prospects of our products.\nOur revenues may be limited if the marketing claims asserted about our products are not approved.\nOnce a drug product is approved by the FDA, including its labels and labeling, the Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (\u201cOPDP\u201d), the FDA\u2019s marketing surveillance department within the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, will oversee and regulate marketing claims asserted by us and our pharmaceutical company partners. If we or a pharmaceutical company partner fails to use acceptable marketing claims for a product incorporating our drug technologies, our revenues from that product may be limited and we may be subject to enforcement actions. The claims the pharmaceutical company partners are asserting about our drug delivery technologies, or the drug product itself, may not be accepted by OPDP.\nChanges in product candidate manufacturing or formulation may result in additional costs or delay.\nAs product candidates are developed through preclinical studies to late-stage clinical trials towards approval and commercialization, it is common that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods and formulation, are altered along the way in an effort to optimize processes and results. Any of these changes could cause our product candidates to perform differently and affect the results of planned clinical trials or other future clinical trials conducted with the altered materials. Such changes may also require additional testing, FDA notification, or FDA approval. This could delay completion of clinical trials; require the conduct of bridging clinical trials or studies, or the repetition of one or more clinical trials; increase clinical trial costs; delay approval of our product candidates; and jeopardize our business prospects.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nFuture conversions or exercises by holders of options could dilute our common stock.\nAs of March 1, 2017, we had options outstanding that are exercisable, at exercise prices ranging from $0.47 to $4.54 per share, for an aggregate of approximately 11,000,000 shares of our common stock. Purchasers of our common stock could therefore experience dilution of their investment upon exercise of the above options.\nSales of our common stock by our officers and directors may lower the market price of our common stock.\nAs of March 1, 2017, our officers and directors beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately 19,000,000 shares (or approximately 12%) of our outstanding common stock, including stock options exercisable within 60 days. If our officers and directors, or other stockholders, sell a substantial amount of our common stock, it could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe intend to retain any earnings in the foreseeable future for our continued growth and, thus, do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market could result in a delisting of our common stock.\nIf we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market, such as the requirement that we maintain a minimum bid price of at least $1.00 per share, NASDAQ may take steps to de-list our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we would expect to seek to take actions to restore our compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s listing requirements, but\nwe can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock or prevent our common stock from dropping below the NASDAQ minimum bid price requirement in the future.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be volatile and fluctuate significantly, which could result in substantial losses for investors.\nThe trading price for our common stock has been, and we expect it to continue to be, volatile. The price at which our common stock trades depends upon a number of factors, including our historical and anticipated operating results, our financial situation, announcements of technological innovations or new products by us, our partners or our competitors, our ability or inability to raise the additional capital we may need and the terms on which we raise it, and general market and economic conditions. Some of these factors are beyond our control. Broad market fluctuations may lower the market price of our common stock and affect the volume of trading in our stock, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospect. Among the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate are the risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and other factors, including:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our quarterly operating results or the operating results of our competitors;\n\u2022\nvariance in our financial performance from the expectations of investors;\n\u2022\nchanges in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of our markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles or changes in interpretations of existing principles, which could affect our financial results;\n\u2022\nfailure of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance or commercial success;\n\u2022\nconditions and trends in the markets we serve;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u2022\nsuccess of competitive products and services;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations or earnings of our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant new products, contracts, acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in legislation or regulatory policies, practices or actions;\n\u2022\nthe commencement or outcome of litigation involving our company, our general industry or both;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of debt;\n\u2022\nactual or expected sales of our common stock by our stockholders; and\n\u2022\nthe trading volume of our common stock.\nIn addition, the stock markets, in general, the NASDAQ Capital Market and the market for specialty pharmaceutical companies in particular, may experience a loss of investor confidence. Such loss of investor confidence may result in extreme price and volume fluctuations in our common stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of our business, financial condition or results of operations. These broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock and expose us to securities class action litigation. Such litigation, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could further materially harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nAnti-takeover effects of certain certificate of incorporation and bylaw provisions could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent persons from acquiring or attempting to acquire us. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors, without action of our stockholders, to designate and issue preferred stock in one or more series, with such rights, preferences and privileges as the board of directors shall determine. In addition, our bylaws grant our board of directors the authority to adopt, amend or repeal all or any of our bylaws, subject to the power of the stockholders to change or repeal the bylaws. In addition, our bylaws limit who may call meetings of our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 88905, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "ATRS"}
