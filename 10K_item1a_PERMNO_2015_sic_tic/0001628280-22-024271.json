RISK FACTORS\nThe business, financial condition and operating results of the Company may be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below. Any one or more of such factors could directly or indirectly cause the Company\u2019s actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past or anticipated future results of operations and financial condition. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II-Item 7 - \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II-Item 8 - \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report. For risks relating to VIA Motors International, Inc. (\u201cVIA\u201d) and the anticipated acquisition thereof, see our Registration Statement on Form S-4 initially filed on November 5, 2021, as amended from time to time.\nRisk Factors Summary\nWe are an operating company that conducts a substantial majority of our operations through our operating subsidiaries established in various jurisdictions. Accordingly, we are subject to the risk factors affecting particular industries, businesses, and geographical locations of our subsidiaries. Further, our structure involves certain risks with regard to our international operations. Additionally, we are subject to risk factors concomitant to our anticipated acquisition of VIA and filed with SEC in the Registration Statement which is not effective as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAs a result of the foregoing, our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described in \u201cPart I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report. These risks are arranged by groups and include, but are not limited to, the following:\nRisks Related to Industries in Which We Operate\nIn connection with the operations of Ideanomics Mobility, the Company:\n\u2022faces extreme competitive pressure associated with its lack of experience in participation in the relatively new global commercial EV market;\n\u2022is challenged by a wide array of intellectual property-related risks;\n\u2022may become subject to the product liability risks that are particularly high in the automotive industry;\n\u2022in collaboration with financial institutions, needs to introduce and promote new financial models allowing the market participants to cost effectively transition their commercial vehicle fleets to EVs;\n\u2022relies on the current governmental initiatives promoting and prioritizing fuel efficiency and alternative energy in various jurisdictions; and\n\u2022may experience the consequences of the supply-chain crisis and chip shortage.\nIn connection with the operations of Ideanomics Capital, the Company:\n\u2022is sensitive to numerous economic factors influencing the real estate market of the U.S. in general and the real estate market of the State of California in particular;\n\u2022is dependent on the reliability of the financial institutions it uses in connection with its services;\n\u2022is subject to severe competition; and\n\u2022can be negatively affected by regulatory changes.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Strategy\nIn connection with its strategy and development risks, the Company:\n\u2022requires additional financing necessary for its development;\n\u2022faces significant financial, managerial, and administrative burdens in connection with its strategic approach of acquiring new businesses and business segments;\n\u2022is dependent on its ability to hire and retain key employees with the specialists' skills in various areas;\n\u2022may be negatively affected by current and potential litigation, or regulatory proceedings; and\n\u2022presents a doubt about its financial viability and as to whether it will be able to continue as a going concern.\nIn connection with its information technology systems and cyber-security the Company:\n\u2022must keep pace with the latest technological changes in order to remain competitive;\n\u2022may have defect or disruptions in its technological products;\n\u2022was and will remain subject to malicious cyber-attacks and other security incidents; and\n\u2022is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign privacy, data use and data protection content, consumer competition and other similar laws and regulations.\nIn connection with its internal controls and compliance with applicable securities laws, the Company:\n\u2022faces the consequences of restatements of its Quarterly Reports for the periods ended March 31, 2021, June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2021;\n\u2022identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting and concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were not effective;\n\u2022lost its Form S-3 eligibility; and\n\u2022may have inadvertently violated Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Securities\nIn connection with ownership of securities risks:\n\u2022certain provisions of our charter documents and applicable law may have an anti-takeover effect;\n\u2022we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future; and\n\u2022our common stock may be delisted.\nFinancial Market and Economic Risks\n\u2022A disruption in our funding sources and access to the capital markets would have an adverse effect on our liquidity.\nRisks Related to all of our International Operations\nThe Company is subject to general geopolitical and economic risks in connection with our global operations.\nSpecifically in connection with our business in the PRC, it is subject to numerous risks that are severely exacerbated by the recent actions and statements of the Chinese government including but not limited to:\n\u2022the ability of the Chinese government to exercise its discretionary powers with regard to any business on its territory at any time;\n\u2022uncertainties in connection with the tensions between the United States and China;\n\u2022the inability of the U.S.-triggered investigations on the territory of China and limited law-enforcement opportunities against our Chinese subsidiaries;\n\u2022restrictions on currency exchange and limitations in transferring money from our subsidiaries domiciled in China in the form of dividends;\n\u2022restrictions under PRC law on our PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make dividends;\n\u2022no guarantee that future audit reports in connection with Chinese operations will be prepared by auditors that are subject to inspections by the PCAOB; and\n\u2022China-specific economic and regulatory processes transforming the Chinese labor market and renewable energy sectors.\nRisks Related to Anticipated Acquisition of VIA\n\u2022Our planned acquisition of VIA presents considerable uncertainties and risks including requirements for additional capitalization.\nRisks Related to Industries in Which We Operate\nRisks Related to the Industries of Ideanomics Mobility\nWe experience significant competitive pressure in the Ideanomics Mobility business unit, which may negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s Ideanomics Mobility business unit is operating in the commercial EV market globally. The commercial EV market is still in its development stage and the rate at which the operators of fleets of commercial vehicles replace their ICE vehicles with EV is very dependent upon (i) environmental and clean air regulations that mandate conversion to EV, (ii) the subsidies that government bodies make available to cover the cost of conversion, (iii) the availability of financing to cover some or all of the cost of conversion, (iv) regulations governing the amount of locally manufactured content required in vehicles sold in a particular market, (v) the availability of charging and battery swap infrastructure, and (vi) the rate at which EV technologies evolve.\nEnvironmental and clean air regulations drive the timing and rate at which fleet operators convert to EV and by extension the size of the market and the type of vehicles that are in demand at any time. The Company\u2019s revenues and profits may be adversely impacted if demand for EVs is lower than expected due to a change in regulation or regulations favor the conversion of vehicle types that have lower profit margins.\nConverting fleets to EV is very capital intensive and most operators require substantial amounts of funding in the form of government and municipal subsidies and bank financing. The amount and form of subsidies are subject to change from time to time as government bodies adjust subsidies to influence consumer behavior. The mechanisms for financing of EVs are still being developed and large-scale conversion from ICE engines to EV is highly dependent upon the amount and terms of financing available for the conversion to EV.\nWe currently have limited intellectual property rights related to our Ideanomics Mobility business unit, and primarily rely on third parties through agreements with them to conduct research and development activities and protect proprietary information.\nAlthough we believe our success will depend in part on our ability to acquire, invest in or develop proprietary technology to effectively compete with our competitors, we currently have, and for the foreseeable future will have, limited direct intellectual property rights related to our new Ideanomics Mobility business unit. The intellectual property relevant to the products and services we plan to provide is held primarily by third parties, including our strategic partners. Accordingly, we will rely on these third parties for research and development activities, which will present certain risks. For example, we will have limited control over the research and development activities of the business of our partners, and may require licenses from these third parties if we wish to develop products directly. If these businesses are unable to effectively maintain a competitive edge relative to the market with their technologies and intellectual property, it may adversely affect our business and financial position.\nOur reliance on third parties also presents risks related to ownership, use, and protection of proprietary information. We are required to rely on the terms of the related agreements, including the partnership agreements to protect our interests, as well as our investments and partners\u2019 trade secret protections, non-disclosure agreements, and invention assignment agreements to protect confidential and proprietary information. If the intellectual property and other confidential information of our investments and strategic partners are not adequately protected, competitors may be able to use their proprietary technologies and information, thereby eroding any competitive advantages that intellectual property provides to us.\nWe may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend against such claims.\nIf we become liable for product liability claims, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be harmed. The automotive industry experiences significant product liability claims, and we face an inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event the electric vehicles that we sell do not meet applicable standards or requirements, resulting in property damage, personal injury, or death. Our risks in this area are particularly pronounced given we have limited experience of selling electric vehicles. Although we ensured that we have thorough quality protection and testing measures, we cannot assure you that our quality protection and testing measures will be as effective as we expect. Any failure in any of our quality assurance steps or contractual clauses with our partners would cause a defect in electric vehicles sold by us, and in turn, could harm our customers. A successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award as we may undertake joint and several liability with the manufacturer. Moreover, a product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our business, which would have a material adverse effect on our brand, business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe success of the Company\u2019s efforts to develop its Ideanomics Mobility business unit is highly dependent upon suitable financing structures being developed.\nThe market for commercial fleets of EVs is in the early stage of development and provides unique challenges to fleet owners trying to finance the purchase of fleets of EVs and the related charging, storage, and battery infrastructure. Unlike vehicles powered by ICEs, the power source in an EV, the battery, can be separated from the vehicle which creates unique challenges for lenders in valuing the collateral for any loan. Additionally, the market for commercial EVs is very new and consequently, there is no reliable history of resale values to support lending decisions. Large-scale adoption of EVs will require a range of borrowing options and loan types to be available to fund purchases and leasing of EVs similar to those that currently exist to finance the purchasing and leasing of traditional ICE vehicles. Additionally, in some of the Company\u2019s target markets, there is no well-developed market for lending to private enterprises and this may further slow down the adoption of EVs. The Company is working with banks and insurance companies to create lending structures and pools of capital that can be used to finance fleet purchases of commercial EVs. Even if the Company can create the necessary pools of capital and lending structures there is no guarantee that any regulatory approvals required for these new structures will be obtained. If the Company is not able to develop a solution for the funding of fleet purchases of EVs and related charging and battery infrastructure, then the Company\u2019s Ideanomics Mobility business may not be successful and generate minimal revenues, and incur substantial losses.\nWe may be affected by the supply chain issues of the automotive industry.\nWe are aware that some domestic and foreign EV manufacturers have their operations negatively affected as a result of general economic conditions. Recently, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many car manufacturers including EV manufacturers were required to temporarily shut down their manufacturing facilities or operate at a reduced capacity, and supply chain issues in sourcing computer chips necessary for manufacturing new vehicles and certain automotive products have resulted in a global chip shortage, which could further delay or stall new vehicle production. There is no guarantee that our business will not face the same problems in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our EV business.\nThe success of our business depends in large part on our ability to protect our proprietary information and technology and enforce our intellectual property rights against third parties.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright, service mark, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights, all of which provide only limited protection. We cannot assure you that any patents will be issued with respect to our currently pending patent applications, in a manner that gives us the protection that we seek, if at all, or that any future patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented. Our currently issued patents and any patents that may be issued in the future with respect to pending or future patent applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection, or they may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. Also, we cannot assure you that any future service mark registrations will be issued with respect to pending or future applications or that any registered service marks will be enforceable or provide adequate protection of our proprietary rights.\nWe endeavor to enter into agreements with our employees and contractors and agreements with parties with whom we do business to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology or the reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property. The enforcement of our intellectual property also depends on our legal actions against these infringers being successful, but we cannot be sure these actions will be successful, even when our rights have been infringed.\nFurther, effective patent, trademark, service mark, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our services are available over the internet. In addition, the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in EV-related industries are uncertain and still evolving.\nChanges to existing federal, state, or international laws or regulations applicable to us could cause an erosion of our current competitive strengths.\nOur business is subject to a variety of federal, state, and international laws and regulations, including those with respect to government incentives promoting fuel efficiency and alternate forms of energy, electric vehicles, and others. These laws and regulations, and the interpretation or application of these laws and regulations, could change. Any reduction, elimination, or discriminatory application of government subsidies and economic incentives because of policy changes, fiscal tightening, or other reasons may result in diminished revenues from government sources and diminished demand for our products. In addition, new laws or regulations affecting our business could be enacted. These laws and regulations are frequently costly to comply with and may divert a significant portion of management\u2019s attention. If we fail to comply with these applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to significant liabilities which could adversely affect our business.\nThere are many federal, state, and international laws that may affect our business, including measures to regulate EVs and charging systems. If we fail to comply with these applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to significant liabilities which could adversely affect our business.\nThere are a number of significant matters under review and discussion with respect to government regulations that may affect business and/or harm our customers, and thereby adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Industries of Ideanomics Capital\nIf adverse changes in the levels of real estate market activity occur, the revenues of our Timios subsidiaries may decline.\nTitle insurance, settlement services, and appraisal revenue are closely related to the level of real estate activity, which includes, among other things, sales, mortgage financing, and mortgage refinancing. The levels of real estate activity are primarily affected by the average price of real estate sales, the availability of funds to finance purchases, and mortgage interest rates. Both the volume and the average price of residential real estate transactions have increased substantially in many parts of the country over the past year. Due to the unprecedented nature of activity, these trends are unlikely to continue at the same level in the long- term.\nWe have found that residential real estate activity generally decreases in the following situations:\n\u2022Mortgage interest rates are high or increasing;\n\u2022Mortgage funding supply is limited; and\n\u2022The United States economy is weak, including high unemployment levels.\nIf there is a decline in the level of real estate market activity or the average price of real estate sales, such decline may adversely affect our title insurance, settlement services, and appraisal management revenues. In 2021, the mortgage interest rate has increased, which may negatively impact the amount of mortgage refinancing activity in comparison to 2020. In addition, uncertain or fluctuating real estate valuations and the inability for third-party purchasers to obtain capital, inflation, and concomitant economic consequences thereof are among the factors that may significantly decrease the number of real estate operations. Our revenues in future periods will continue to be subject to these and other factors which are beyond our control and, as a result, are likely to fluctuate.\nIf financial institutions at which we hold escrow funds fail, it could have a material adverse impact on our Timios subsidiary.\nWe hold customers\u2019 assets in escrow at various financial institutions, pending completion of real estate transactions. These assets are maintained in segregated bank accounts. Failure of one or more of these financial institutions may lead us to become liable for the funds owed to third parties and there is no guarantee that we would recover all of the funds deposited, whether through Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation coverage or otherwise.\nIf we experience changes in the rate or severity of title insurance claims, it may adversely impact our ability to conduct business through our Timios subsidiary.\nBy their nature, claims are often complex, vary greatly in dollar amounts, and are affected by economic and market conditions and the legal environment existing at the time of settlement of the claims. Some of our subsidiaries are underwritten title companies, and if the title claims exceed the threshold established by the title companies that underwrite the insurance our subsidiaries offer, it may cause our subsidiaries\u2019 appointments to be revoked and negatively impact our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to conduct business.\nBecause our Timios subsidiary is dependent upon California for a substantial portion of our title insurance premiums, our business may be adversely affected by regulatory conditions in California.\nCalifornia is the largest source of revenue for the title insurance industry and, in 2021, California-based premiums accounted for a substantial portion of the premiums earned by our Timios subsidiary. A significant part of our revenues and profitability are therefore subject to our operations in California and to the prevailing regulatory conditions in California. Adverse regulatory\ndevelopments in California, which could include reductions in the maximum rates permitted to be charged, cost of employment regulations, inadequate rate increases, or more fundamental changes in the design or implementation of the California title insurance regulatory framework, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe title insurance business is highly competitive.\nCompetition in the title insurance and appraisal management industry is intense, particularly with respect to price, service, and expertise. Business comes primarily by referral from real estate agents, lenders, developers, and other settlement providers. The sources of business lead to a great deal of competition among title agents and appraisal management companies. There are numerous national companies and smaller companies at the regional and local levels. The smaller companies are an ever-present competitive risk in the regional and local markets where their business connections can give them a competitive edge. Although we are not aware of any current initiatives to reduce regulatory barriers to entering our industry, any such reduction could result in new competitors, including financial institutions, entering the title insurance business. From time to time, new entrants enter the marketplace with alternative products to traditional title insurance, although many of these alternative products have been disallowed by title insurance regulators. These alternative products, if permitted by regulators, could adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Competition among the major title insurance companies and any new entrants could lower our premium and fee revenues.\nIndustry regulatory changes and scrutiny could adversely affect our ability to compete for or retain business or increase our cost of doing business.\nThe title insurance industry has recently been, and continues to be, under regulatory scrutiny in a number of states with respect to pricing practices, alleged Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act violations, and unlawful rebating practices. The regulatory environment could lead to industry-wide reductions in premium rates and escrow fees, the inability to get rate increases when necessary, as well as to changes that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to compete for or retain business or raise the costs of additional regulatory compliance. Further, if regulatory decrees delaying foreclosures are extended, it will continue to impact our ability to recognize revenue and profitability from our default title and settlement services department.\nRapid technological changes in our industry require timely and cost-effective responses. Our earnings may be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively use technology to increase productivity.\nTechnological advances occur rapidly in the title insurance industry as industry standards evolve and title insurers introduce new products and services. We believe that our future success depends on our ability to anticipate technological changes and to offer products and services that meet evolving standards on a timely and cost-effective basis. Successful implementation and customer acceptance of our technology-based services will be crucial to our future profitability. There is a risk that the introduction of new products and services, or advances in technology, could reduce the usefulness of our products and render them obsolete.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Strategy\nStrategy and Development Risks\nWe expect to require additional financing in the future to meet our business requirements. Such capital raising may be costly, difficult, or not possible to obtain and, if obtained, could significantly dilute current stockholders\u2019 equity interests.\nWe must continue to rely on proceeds from debt and equity issuances to pay for ongoing operating expenses and repay existing debt in order to execute our business plan. Although we may attempt to raise funds by issuing debt or equity instruments, additional financing may not be available to us on terms acceptable to us or at all, or such resources may not be received in a timely manner. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may be required to scale back or to discontinue certain operations, scale back or discontinue the development of new business lines, reduce headcount, sell assets, file for bankruptcy, reorganize, merge with another entity, or cease operations.\nAs we acquire, dispose of, or restructure our businesses, product lines, and technologies, we may encounter unforeseen costs and difficulties that could impair our financial performance.\nAn important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products, augment our market coverage and distribution ability, or enhance our capabilities. As a result, we may seek to make acquisitions of companies, products, or technologies, or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our business strategies. For regulatory or other reasons, we may not be successful in our attempts to acquire or\ndispose of businesses, products, or technologies, resulting in significant financial costs, reduced or lost opportunities, and diversion of management\u2019s attention. Managing an acquired business, disposing of product technologies, or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks, including, among other things, (i) difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups, (ii) diversion of management\u2019s attention away from other business concerns, (iii) amortization of acquired intangible assets, (iv) adverse customer reaction to our decision to cease support for a product, and (v) potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions, disposition of product lines or technologies, or reduction in personnel or that our management, personnel, or systems will be adequate to support continued operations. Any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nIn addition, any acquisition could result in changes, such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the amortization of related intangible assets, and goodwill impairment charges, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or the price of our common stock.\nThe success of our business is dependent on our ability to hire and retain key employees with the specialists\u2019 skills that we need for our business.\nWe depend on the services of our key employees. Our success will largely depend on our ability to hire and retain these key employees and to attract and retain qualified senior and middle-level managers to our management team.\nWe have recruited executives and management both in the United States and in our operations outside of the United States to assist in our ability to manage the business and to recruit and oversee employees. While we believe we offer compensation packages that are consistent with market practice, we cannot be certain that we will be able to hire and retain sufficient personnel to support our business. The loss of any of our key employees, or failure to find a suitable successor, would significantly harm our business. Our future success will also depend on our ability to identify, hire, develop and retain skilled key employees. We do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees. Future sales or acquisitions by us may also cause uncertainty among our current employees and employees of an acquired entity, which could lead to the departure of key employees. Such departures could have an adverse impact on our business and the anticipated benefits of a sale or acquisition.\nIntellectual-property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and could distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development, sales, marketing, or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of intellectual property litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nWe are currently, and may in the future be, subject to substantial litigation, investigations, and proceedings that could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and result in harm to our business.\nWe are actively involved in a variety of litigations and other legal matters and may be subject to additional litigations, investigations, arbitration proceedings, audits, regulatory inquiries, and similar actions, including matters related to commercial disputes, intellectual property, employment, securities laws, disclosures, environmental, tax, accounting, class action, and product liability, as well as trade, regulatory and other claims related to our business and our industry, which we refer to collectively as legal proceedings. For example, we are subject to an ongoing securities class action and shareholder derivative actions as well as an SEC investigation. Refer to Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report for additional information regarding these specific matters.\nAs reported previously, the Company is subject to an investigation by the SEC and has responded to various information requests and subpoenas from the SEC. The Company is fully cooperating with the SEC\u2019s requests, and cannot predict the outcome of this investigation.\nWe are unable to predict the outcome, duration, scope, result, or related costs of the investigations and related litigation and, therefore, any of these risks could impact us significantly beyond expectations. Moreover, we are unable to predict the potential for any additional investigations or litigation, any of which could exacerbate these risks or expose us to potential criminal or civil liabilities, sanctions, or other remedial measures, and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows. Regardless of the merits of the claims and the outcome, legal proceedings have resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant legal fees and expenses, diversion of management\u2019s time and other resources, and adverse publicity. Such proceedings could also adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may have inadvertently violated Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act (implementing Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) and may be subject to sanctions as a result.\nSection 13(k) of the Exchange Act provides that it is unlawful for a company that has a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act to, directly or indirectly, including through any subsidiary, extend or maintain credit in the form of a personal loan to or for any director or executive officer of the Company. As of July 31, 2021, there was a loan (in the form of a personal travel expense paid by the Company) from the Company to Shane McMahon, the Company\u2019s Executive Chairman of the Board, which could be considered to be a personal loan made by the Company to a director or officer of the Company and may have violated Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act. The amount was repaid to us in December 2021. Issuers that are found to have violated Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act may be subject to civil sanctions, including injunctive remedies and monetary penalties, as well as criminal sanctions. The imposition of any of such sanctions on us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, which together with our limited working capital raises substantial doubt about our financial viability and as to whether we will be able to continue as a going concern.\nOur auditor\u2019s report on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, includes an explanatory paragraph related to the existence of substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We are an operating company with a limited operating history that encompasses a large number of industries and businesses.\nWe are not profitable and have incurred losses in each year since our inception in October 2004. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we had net losses of approximately $256.7 million, $111.6 million, and $96.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $605.8 million.\nThe industries of Ideanomics Mobility and Ideanomics Capital are highly speculative, involve a high degree of risk, and require substantial capital investment. We continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. We have limited working capital and cannot guarantee that we will achieve market acceptance and be commercially successful in the long term.\nAlthough we generate revenues from product sales, these revenues have not been sufficient, and may never be sufficient, to support our operations. We expect to continue to incur losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future. We require significant cash resources to execute our business plans and we will need to raise additional cash to continue to fund our operating plan. We expect to finance our operating plan through a combination of public or private equity or debt offerings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and other similar licensing arrangements in both the short term and the long term. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, for a number of reasons, including market conditions, our ability to generate positive data from our clinical studies, and the need for our stockholders to approve an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of shares of common stock that we are authorized to issue.\nThe aforementioned factors, which are largely outside of our control, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date of filing of this Annual Report. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts or the classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern within one year after the date of filing of this annual report. If we are forced to scale down, restructure, limit or cease operations, our stockholders could lose all of their investment in our Company.\nRisks Related to Our Information Technology Systems and Cyber-Security\nOur business depends upon our ability to keep pace with the latest technological changes, and our failure to do so could make us less competitive in our industry.\nThe market for our products and services is characterized by rapid change and technological change, frequent new product innovations, changes in customer requirements and expectations, and evolving industry standards. Products using new technologies or emerging industry standards could make our products and services less attractive. Failure to respond in a timely and cost-effective way to these technological developments may result in serious harm to our business and operating results. As a result, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop and market product and service offerings that respond in a timely manner to the technological advances available to our customers, evolving industry standards, and changing preferences.\nDefects or disruptions in our technology or services could diminish demand for our products and services and subject us to liability.\nBecause our technology, products, and services are complex and use or incorporate a variety of computer hardware, software, and databases, both developed in-house and acquired from third-party vendors, our technology, products, and services may have errors or defects. Errors and defects could result in unanticipated downtime or failure and could cause financial loss and harm to our reputation and our business. We have from time to time found defects and errors in our technology, products, and services, and defects and errors in our technology, products, or services may be detected in the future. In addition, our customers may use our technology, products, and services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption for other customers. As we acquire companies, we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies, products, and services, and maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our technology, products, and services. Since our customers use our technology, products, and services for important aspects of their businesses and for financial transactions, any errors, defects, or disruptions in such technology, products, and services or other performance problems with our technology, products, and services could subject our customers to financial loss and hurt our reputation. As we deploy more product lines and provide a wider array of services, such risks will exponentially increase.\nOur internally developed platform for Timios' business functions on software that is highly technical and complex and may now or in the future contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code may only be discovered after the code has been deployed. Any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities discovered in our code after deployment, inability to identify the cause or causes of performance problems within an acceptable period of time, or difficulty maintaining and improving the performance of our platform, particularly during peak usage times, could result in damage to our reputation or brand, loss of revenues, or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe expect to continue to make significant investments to maintain and improve the availability of our existing software platform and new platforms as needed, and to enable rapid releases of new features and products. To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed, and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business, and operating results may be harmed.\nWe have previously experienced, and may in the future experience, service disruptions, outages, and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, third-party service providers, human or software errors, and capacity constraints. If our application is unavailable when customers attempt to access it or it does not load as quickly as they expect, customers may seek other services.\nMalicious cyber-attacks and other adverse events affecting our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation, and cause losses or regulatory penalties.\nDeveloping and maintaining our operational systems and infrastructure are challenging, particularly as a result of us and our clients entering into new businesses, jurisdictions, and regulatory regimes, rapidly evolving legal and regulatory requirements, and technological shifts. Our financial, accounting, data processing, or other operating and compliance systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, including malicious cyber-attack or other adverse events, which may adversely affect our ability to process these transactions or provide services or products.\nIn addition, our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures, such as software programs, firewalls, and similar technology, to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our and our customers\u2019 information, and endeavor to\nmodify these protective measures as circumstances warrant, the nature of cyber threats continues to evolve. As a result, our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss, or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account takeovers, unavailability or disruption of service, computer viruses, acts of vandalism, or other malicious code, ransomware, hacking, phishing, and other cyber-attacks and other adverse events that could have an adverse security impact. Despite the defensive measures we have taken, these threats may come from external forces, such as governments, nation-state actors, organized crime, hackers, and other third parties, including outsource or infrastructure-support providers and application developers, or may originate internally from within us. Given the high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and rectified.\nWe also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination, or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities, including vendors, customers, counterparties, exchanges, clearing agents, clearinghouses, or other financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source of a cyber-attack on our breach of our operational systems, network, data, or infrastructure.\nThere have been an increasing number of ransomware, hacking, phishing, and other cyber-attacks in recent years in various industries, including ours, and cyber-security risk management has been the subject of increasing focus by our regulators. Like other companies, we have on occasion experienced, and may continue to experience, threats to our systems, including viruses, phishing, and other cyber-attacks. The number and complexity of these threats continue to increase over time. The techniques used in these attacks are increasingly sophisticated, change frequently, and are often not recognized until launched. If one or more cyber-attacks occur, it could potentially jeopardize the confidential, proprietary, and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, as well as our customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 operations, which could result in reputational damage, financial losses, customer dissatisfaction and/or regulatory penalties, which may not in all cases by covered by insurance. If an actual, threatened, or perceived cyber-attack or breach of our security occurs, our clients could lose confidence in our platforms and solutions, security measures, and reliability, which would materially harm our ability to retain existing clients and gain new clients. As a result of any such attack or breach, we may be required to expend significant resources to repair system, network, or infrastructure damage and to protect against the threat of future cyber-attacks or security breaches. We could also face litigation or other claims from impacted individuals as well as substantial regulatory sanctions or fines. Our Timios business previously experienced such cyber-attacks and may face other security incidents of varying degrees from time to time. We incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating such incidents.\nThe extent of a particular cyber-attack and the steps that we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the attack is known. While such an investigation is ongoing, we may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyber-attack, and any resulting damage may continue to spread. Furthermore, it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the harm caused by the cyber-attack, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated. Any or all of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber-attack.\nOur regulators in recent years have increased their examination and enforcement focus on all matters of our businesses, especially matters relating to cyber-security threats, including the assessment of firms\u2019 vulnerability to cyber-attacks. In particular, regulatory concerns have been raised about firms establishing effective cyber-security governance and risk management policies, practices, and procedures that enable the identification of risks, testing and monitoring of the effectiveness of such procedures and adaptation to address any weaknesses; protecting firm networks and information; data loss prevention, identifying and addressing the risk associated with remote access to client information and fund transfer requests; identifying and addressing risks associated with customers business partners, counterparties, vendors, and other third parties, including exchanges and clearing organizations; preventing and detecting unauthorized access or activities; adopting effective mitigation and business continuity plans to timely and effectively address the impact of cyber-security breaches; and establishing protocols for reporting cyber-security incidents. As we enter new jurisdictions or different product area verticals, we may be subject to new areas of risk or to cyber-attacks in areas in which we have less familiarity and tools. A technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting requirements. The SEC has issued guidance stating that, as a public company, we are expected to have controls and procedures that relate to cybersecurity disclosure, and are required to disclose information relating to certain cyber-attacks or other information security breaches in disclosures required to be made under the federal securities laws. While any insurance that we may have that covers a specific cyber-security incident may help to prevent our realizing a significant loss from the incident, it would not protect us from the effects of adverse regulatory actions that may result from the incident or a finding that we had inadequate cyber-security controls, including the reputational harm that could result from such regulatory actions.\nWe may face particular privacy, data security, and data protection risks.\nLegislators and/or regulators in countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, information security, and data protection laws. In particular, the European Union\u2019s GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018, imposes additional obligations and risk upon our business and which increases substantially the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance. The GDPR and other similar laws and regulations, including the CCPA and other similar state laws recently or soon to be enacted, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices. Furthermore, the CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020, and many of its requirements have not yet been interpreted by courts, and best practices are still being developed by the industry, all of which increase the risk of compliance failure and related adverse impacts.\nRisks Related to the Internal Controls and Compliance with Applicable Securities Laws.\nWe have restated our consolidated financial statements for several prior periods, which has affected and may continue to affect investor confidence, our stock price, our ability to raise capital in the future, and our reputation with our customers, which may result in stockholder litigation and may reduce customer confidence in our ability to complete new opportunities.\nThe Company filed amended Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2021, June 30, 2021 and September 30,2021 to restate the unaudited quarterly financial data for said periods. The restatement of our prior consolidated financial statements primarily reflects the correction of certain errors, which resulted from an incorrect application of U.S. GAAP, as described in more detail in the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q/A for the periods ended March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021 filed with the SEC on November 22, 2021. Such restatement may have the effect of eroding investor confidence in the Company and our financial reporting and accounting practices and processes and may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock, may result in stockholder litigation, may make it more difficult for us to raise capital on acceptable terms, if at all, and may negatively impact our reputation with our customers and cause customers to place new orders with other companies.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which, did and could continue to, if not remediated, adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner.\nWe have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2021, due to the existence of material weaknesses in such controls. We have also concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2021, due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, all as described in Part II, Item 9A of this Annual Report. Although we have initiated remediation measures to address the identified weaknesses, we cannot provide assurance that our remediation efforts will be adequate to allow us to conclude that such controls will be effective in the future. Moreover, we project that the aforesaid material weakness may exist over years before being remediated. We also cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not arise or be identified in the future.\nWe intend to continue our remediation activities and to continue to improve our overall control environment and our operational and financial systems and infrastructure, as well as to continue to train, retain and manage our personnel who are essential to effective internal control. In doing so, we will continue to incur expenses and expend management\u2019s time on compliance-related issues. However, we cannot ensure that the steps that we have taken or will take will successfully remediate the errors. If we are unable to successfully complete our remediation efforts or favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, our operating results, financial position, ability to accurately report our financial results and timely file our SEC reports, and our stock price could be adversely affected.\nMoreover, because of the inherent limitations of any control system, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis, or at all. If we are unable to provide reliable and timely financial reports in the future, our business and reputation may be further harmed. Restated financial statements and failures in internal control may also cause us to fail to meet reporting obligations, negatively affect investor and customer confidence in our management and the accuracy of our financial statements and disclosures, result in events of default under our banking agreements, or result in adverse publicity and concerns from investors and customers, any of which could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock, subject us to regulatory investigations and penalties or additional stockholder litigation, and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nWe may have inadvertently violated Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, codified as Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act in connection with a certain one-time advance we made to our director\u037e as a result, we may be subject to civil and criminal sanctions which, if imposed, could have a material adverse effect upon us.\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, we paid the personal private jet expense in the amount of approximately $60,000 for one of our directors due to a personal emergency reported by the director and no availability of commercial flights at the time. Subsequently, we concluded that such expense, being inconsistent with our customary directors\u2019 reimbursement practice, had to be repaid by the director. Accordingly, such repayment was completed by means of an offset against the compensation owed to the director, to which the director did not object. Hence, the aforementioned arrangement may be interpreted as a \u201cpersonal loan\u201d to our director, although the intent of the Company and the director was to avoid granting a perquisite inconsistent with the Company\u2019s practice.\nSection 13(k) of the Exchange Act provides that it is unlawful for a company, which has a class of securities registered under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, to directly or indirectly, including through any subsidiary, extend or maintain credit in the form of a personal loan to or for any director or executive officer of the company. Issuers violating Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act may be subject to civil sanctions, including injunctive remedies and monetary penalties, as well as criminal sanctions. The imposition of any of such sanctions on us may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe have not concluded that the advance made to our director under the above-described arrangement was a \u201cpersonal loan\u201d within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act or that any violations of the Exchange Act have occurred relating to such matter. Although we submitted a form to the SEC Staff on a no-name basis to inquire whether the aforementioned arrangement with our director should be prohibited by Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act, we have not received interpretive guidance from the SEC Staff. Further, we have not received any notice that the matters discussed herein are under investigation by any governmental authority or that any proceeding relating to such matters has been initiated by any person.\nBased on our current strategies, we need to raise additional capital to execute on those strategies, and such capital may not be available to us or may only be available on unfavorable terms due to the fact that the Company lost its S-3 eligibility.\nTo allow us to timely respond to opportunities to raise capital, we may need to file various registration statements and not rely on exemptions from registration. Use of a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which would be the optimal form of the registration statement under most circumstances, requires, among other things, that an issuer has timely filed all of its reports under the Exchange Act for at least twelve months, subject only to exceptions for certain Form 8-K filings. We had untimely filed our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2021. In addition, this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the first and second fiscal quarter of the year 2022 are not filed. If we timely file all reports required under the Exchange Act in the future, we will regain eligibility for use of Form S-3 not earlier than August 9, 2023. While the Company continues to have access to capital markets, our ineligibility to use Form S-3 means that it may be more difficult for us to effect public offering transactions and our range of available financing alternatives could be narrowed.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Securities\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation, as amended, and bylaws, as amended, or Nevada law might discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of us or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation, as amended, authorize our Board to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by our Board without further action by our stockholders. These terms may include preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion rights, redemption rights, and sinking fund provisions. The issuance of any preferred stock could diminish the rights of holders of our common stock, and therefore could reduce the value of such common stock. In addition, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with, or sell assets to, a third party. The ability of our Board to issue preferred stock could make it more difficult, delay, discourage, prevent, or make it costlier to acquire or effect a change-in-control, which in turn could prevent our stockholders from recognizing a gain in the event that a favorable offer is extended and could materially and negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nFurthermore, Section 78.438 of the Nevada Revised Statutes prohibits a publicly-held Nevada corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder (generally defined as a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 10% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in\nwhich the person became an interested stockholder) unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. The existence of the foregoing provisions and other potential anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our Company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nFor the foreseeable future, we intend to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock or Series A preferred stock. Accordingly, investors must be prepared to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation to earn an investment return, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our Board deems relevant. In addition, our ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on our ability to declare dividends and profits in our subsidiaries domiciled outside of the United States. Rules in other jurisdictions may greatly restrict and limit the ability of our subsidiaries to declare dividends to us which, in addition to restricting our cash flow, limits our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nWe previously received notices of failure to satisfy continued listing rules from the Nasdaq which may ultimately result in delisting of our common stock.\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. If we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, our common stock may be delisted.\nOn May 17, 2022, we received a notice (the \u201cPeriodic Filings Notice\u201d) from Nasdaq stating that because of the Company\u2019s failure to file its quarterly report timely, the Company was no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules, we submitted a plan to regain compliance and on or about May 17, 2022, Nasdaq has granted the Company\u2019s request for the extension, subject to certain conditions.\nOn May 20, 2022, the Company received a deficiency notice (the \u201cBid Price Notice\u201d) from Nasdaq indicating that the bid price for the Company\u2019s common stock for the preceding 30 consecutive business days had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share required for continued listing under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The Company has been granted a 180 calendar day grace period, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. The continued listing standard will be met if the Company evidences a closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days during the 180 calendar day grace period. In order for Nasdaq to consider granting the Company additional time, the Company would be required, among other things, to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares as well as all other standards for initial listing on Nasdaq, with the exception of the minimum bid price requirement.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company cures the Periodic Filing Notice and the Bid Price Notice. Delisting could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital through the public or private sale of equity securities, would significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities, and would negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. Delisting could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest, and fewer business development opportunities.\nFinancial Market and Economic Risks\nA disruption in our funding sources and access to the capital markets would have an adverse effect on our liquidity.\nLiquidity risk is the risk arising from our ability to meet obligations in a timely manner when they come due. Our liquidity strategy is to maintain the capacity to fund assets and repay liabilities in a timely and cost-effective manner even in adverse market conditions. A disruption in our funding sources may adversely affect our ability to meet our obligations as they become due. An inability to meet obligations in a timely manner would have a negative impact on our ability to refinance maturing debt and fund new asset growth and would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We currently do not have adequate cash to meet our short or long-term anticipated needs. In the event additional capital is raised, it may have a dilutive effect on our existing stockholders.\nRisks Related to our International Operations including Operations in the PRC\nRisks Related to all of our International Operations\nOur international operations expose us to a number of risks.\nOur international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand our operations internationally. In certain international market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and platforms, and promote our brand internationally.\nOur international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022local economic and political conditions, including sanctions and other regulatory actions that prohibit sales to, or purchases from, countries and legal entities that are within the scope of the sanction. Government regulations, both federal and municipal, that may restrict the available market for our products and services through the requirement for a minimum value of local produced content, or restrict the availability of subsidies for products that do not meet designated value for local produced content, e.g., the Buy America program;\n\u2022uncertain economic, legal, and political conditions in China, Europe and other regions where we do business, including, for example, changes in China-Taiwan relations, the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related sanctions and other penalties imposed on Russia by the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and other countries as well as retaliatory actions of Russia against the companies that comply with the aforementioned sanctions;\n\u2022government regulation and restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and customs duties and tariffs), nationalization, and restrictions on foreign ownership;\n\u2022restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, including uncertainty as a result of less Internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights;\n\u2022limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;\n\u2022limited technology infrastructure;\n\u2022environmental and health and safety liabilities and expenditures relating to the disposal and remediation of hazardous substances into the air, water, and ground;\n\u2022shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;\n\u2022increased risk over the ability to collect accounts receivable and other amounts owed to the Company due to the limited credit checking information available in some of the countries we operate in and possible difficulties to pursue legal action to collect amounts owed to us;\n\u2022laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, privacy, network security, encryption, payments, and restrictions on pricing or discounts; and\n\u2022geopolitical events and instability, including international conflicts, war and terrorism.\nWe may face challenges in expanding our international and cross-border businesses and operations.\nAs we expand our international and cross-border businesses into an increasing number of international markets, we will face risks associated with expanding into markets in which we have limited or no experience and in which we may be less well-known. We may be unable to attract a sufficient number of customers and other participants, fail to anticipate competitive conditions, or face difficulties in operating effectively in these new markets. The expansion of our international and cross-border businesses will also expose us to risks inherent in operating businesses globally, including:\n\u2022inability to recruit international and local talent and challenges in replicating or adapting our Company policies and procedures to different local and regional operating environments;\n\u2022lack of acceptance of our product and service offerings;\n\u2022challenges and increased expenses associated with staffing and managing international and cross-border operations and managing an organization spread over multiple jurisdictions;\n\u2022trade barriers, such as import and export restrictions, customs duties and other taxes, competition law regimes and other trade restrictions, as well as other protectionist policies;\n\u2022differing and potentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022increased and conflicting regulatory compliance requirements;\n\u2022challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences;\n\u2022increased costs to protect the security and stability of our information technology systems, intellectual property, and personal data, including compliance costs related to data localization laws;\n\u2022availability and reliability of international and cross-border payment systems and logistics infrastructure;\n\u2022exchange rate fluctuations; and\n\u2022political instability and general economic or political conditions in particular countries or regions.\nRisks Related to Doing Business in the PRC\nU.S. financial regulatory and law enforcement agencies, including without limitation the SEC, U.S. Department of Justice, and U.S. national securities exchanges have limited ability, and in fact may have no ability, to conduct investigations within the PRC concerning our Company, our PRC-based officers, directors, market research services or other professional services or experts.\nA material part of our assets and our current operations are conducted in the PRC, and some professional service providers are nationals and residents of the PRC. U.S. financial regulatory and law enforcement agencies, including without limitation the SEC, U.S. Department of Justice, and U.S. national securities exchanges have limited ability, and in fact may have no ability, to conduct investigations within the PRC concerning our Company, and the PRC may have limited or no agreements in place to facilitate cooperation with the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement for investigations within its jurisdiction.\nAdverse changes in political, economic, and other policies of the Chinese government could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of the PRC, which could materially and adversely affect the growth of our business and our competitive position.\nOur business operations have a material dependency on the PRC for both revenues generated with the PRC and as a source of finished products and components for our global operations. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects are affected significantly by economic, political, and legal developments in the PRC. The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including:\n\u2022the degree of government involvement;\n\u2022the level of development;\n\u2022the growth rate;\n\u2022the control of foreign exchange;\n\u2022the allocation of resources;\n\u2022an evolving and rapidly changing regulatory system; and\n\u2022a lack of sufficient transparency in the regulatory process.\nWhile the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth in the past 30 years, growth has been uneven, both geographically and across various sectors of the economy. The Chinese economy has also experienced certain adverse effects\ndue to the global financial crisis. In addition, the growth rate of the PRC\u2019s gross domestic product has materially slowed in recent years, according to the National Bureau of Statistics of China. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may also have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments, foreign currency exchange restrictions, or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to us.\nThe continued control of these assets and other aspects of the national economy by the Chinese government could materially and adversely affect our business. The Chinese government also exercises significant control over Chinese economic growth through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy, and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.\nAny adverse change in the economic conditions or government policies in the PRC could have a material adverse effect on overall economic growth, which in turn could lead to a reduction in demand for our products and consequently have a material adverse effect on our businesses.\nSeveral PRC regulatory authorities, such as the CAC and the MOFCOM, oversee different aspects of our operations, and we are required to obtain governmental approvals, licenses, permits, and registrations in connection with our operations. For example, certain filings must be made by automobile dealers in China through an information system used for purposes of the national automobile circulation, which is operated by relevant commerce departments, within 90 days after receiving a business license. Furthermore, if our subsidiaries in China were to engage in any activities that could be deemed as providing blockchain information services, we would need to complete certain filing procedures with the CAC and obtain relevant filing numbers. In addition, the PRC government may enact new laws and regulations that require additional licenses, permits, approvals and/or registrations for the operation of any of our existing or future business. As a result, we cannot assure you that we have all the permits, licenses, registrations, approvals and/or business license items covering the sufficient scope of business required for our business, or that we will be able to obtain, maintain or renew any permits, licenses, registrations, approvals and/or business license items covering the sufficient scope of our business in a timely manner or at all.\nUncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could limit the legal protections available to you and to us, which could cause material adverse effects to our business operations.\nWe conduct part of our business through our subsidiaries in the PRC. Our subsidiaries are generally subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in the PRC and, in particular, laws applicable to FIEs. The PRC legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. Since 1979, a series of new PRC laws and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in the PRC. However, there could be a change of law and it is uncertain whether business industries in which our China subsidiaries operate will be subject to the foreign investment restrictions or prohibitions.\nSince the PRC legal system continues to evolve rapidly, the interpretations of many laws, regulations, and rules are not always uniform, and enforcement of these laws, regulations, and rules involve uncertainties, which may limit legal protections available to you and to us. In addition, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules, some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all, and which may have a retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until after the occurrence of the violation.\nIn addition, any litigation in the PRC may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management\u2019s attention. It could be difficult for investors to affect service of process in the United States or to enforce a judgment obtained in the United States against our Chinese operations and entities.\nYou may have difficulty enforcing judgments against us.\nA significant part of our operations is outside of the United States including the operations in PRC. As a result, it may be difficult for you to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons. It may also be difficult for you to enforce in U.S. courts judgments on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us and our officers and directors, that are not residents in the United States and the substantial majority of whose assets are located outside of the United States. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the PRC would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts. Courts in the PRC may recognize and enforce foreign judgments in accordance with the requirements of the PRC Civil Procedures Law based on treaties between the PRC and the country where the judgment is made or on reciprocity between jurisdictions. The PRC does not have any treaties or other arrangements that provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments with the United States. In addition, according to the PRC Civil Procedures Law, courts in the\nPRC will not enforce a foreign judgment against us or our directors and officers if they decide that the judgment violates basic principles of PRC law or national sovereignty, security, or the public interest.\nOur results could be adversely affected by the trade tensions between the United States and the PRC.\nWith the increasing interconnectedness of global economic and financial systems and our business related to the PRC, trade tensions between the United States and the PRC can have an immediate and material adverse impact on our business. Changes to trade policies, treaties, and tariffs in the jurisdictions in which we operate, or the perception that these changes could occur, could adversely affect our international and cross-border operations, our financial condition, and results of operations. For example, the U.S. administration has advocated greater restrictions on trade generally and significant increases on tariffs on goods imported into the United States, particularly from the PRC. Such trade restrictions or tariffs could cause U.S. companies to respond by minimizing their use of Chinese suppliers, thereby moving the supply chain away from China and limiting our competitive advantage in developing our logistics management and financing business. Further, the U.S. or the PRC could impose additional sanctions that could restrict us from doing business directly or indirectly in either country. Such actions could have material adverse impact on our profitability and operations. Government regulations, both federal and municipal, that may restrict the available market for our products and services through the requirement for a minimum value of locally produced content, or restrict the availability of subsidies for products that do not meet designated value for locally produced content, e.g., the Buy America program.\nRestrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to use cash generated from sales in the PRC to fund our business activities outside of the PRC.\nFor our sales in the PRC, At present, a substantial part of our sales are settled in RMB, and any future restrictions on currency exchanges may limit our ability to use revenue generated in RMB to fund any future business activities outside the PRC or to make dividends or other payments in the U.S. dollars. Although the Chinese government introduced regulations in 1996 to allow greater convertibility of the RMB for current account transactions, significant restrictions still remain, including primarily the restriction that FIEs may only buy, sell, or remit foreign currencies after providing valid commercial documents, at those banks in the PRC authorized to conduct foreign exchange business. In addition, foreign exchange transactions under the capital account remain subject to limitations and require approvals from, or registration with, SAFE PRC and other relevant PRC governmental authorities and companies are required to open and maintain separate foreign exchange accounts for capital account items. This could affect our ability to obtain foreign currency through debt or equity financing for our subsidiaries. Recent volatility in the RMB foreign exchange rate as well as capital flight out of the PRC may lead to further foreign exchange restrictions and policies or practices which adversely affect our operations and ability to convert RMB. We cannot be certain that the Chinese regulatory authorities will not impose more stringent restrictions on the convertibility of the RMB.\nRestrictions under PRC law on our PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make dividends and other distributions could materially and adversely affect our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could benefit our business, pay dividends to you, and otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nAt present, part of our sales is earned by our PRC operating entities. However, PRC regulations restrict the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to make dividends and other payments to their offshore parent companies. PRC legal restrictions permit payments of dividends by our PRC subsidiaries only out of their accumulated after-tax profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Our PRC subsidiaries are also required under PRC laws and regulations to allocate at least 10% of their annual after-tax profits determined in accordance with PRC GAAP to a statutory general reserve fund until the amounts in said fund reach 50% of their registered capital. Allocations to these statutory reserve funds can only be used for specific purposes and are not transferable to us in the form of loans, advances, or cash dividends. Any limitations on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to transfer funds to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends and otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Chinese anti-corruption laws, and any determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to the FCPA and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers as defined by the statute, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations and agreements with third parties and make most of our sales in the PRC. The PRC also strictly prohibits bribery of government officials. Our activities in the PRC create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by the employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors of our Company, which may not always be subject to our control. It is our policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices by our employees. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and the employees, consultants, sales agents, or\ndistributors of our company may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA or Chinese anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. In addition, the U.S. government may seek to hold our Company liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.\nOur operations in foreign countries are subject to risks that could adversely impact our financial results, such as economic or political volatility, foreign legal and regulatory requirements, international trade factors (export controls, trade sanctions, duties, tariff barriers, and other restrictions), protection of our proprietary technology in certain countries, potentially burdensome taxes, crime, employee turnover, staffing, managing personnel in diverse culture, labor instability, transportation delays, and foreign currency fluctuations.\nIf we become directly subject to the recent scrutiny, criticism, and negative publicity involving U.S.-listed Chinese companies, we may have to expend significant resources to investigate and resolve the matter which could harm our business operations, stock price, and reputation and could result in a loss of your investment in our stock, especially if such matter cannot be addressed and resolved favorably.\nOver the past several years, U.S. public companies that have substantially all of their operations in the PRC, particularly companies like ours which have completed so-called reverse merger transactions, have been the subject of intense scrutiny, criticism, and negative publicity by investors, financial commentators, and regulatory agencies, such as the SEC. Much of the scrutiny, criticism, and negative publicity is in connection with financial and accounting irregularities and mistakes, a lack of effective internal controls over financial accounting, inadequate corporate governance policies, or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result of the scrutiny, criticism, and negative publicity, the publicly traded stock of many U.S.-listed Chinese companies has sharply decreased in value and, in some cases, has become virtually worthless. Many of these companies are now subject to shareholder lawsuits and SEC enforcement actions and are conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations. It is not clear what effect this sector-wide scrutiny, criticism, and negative publicity will have on our Company, our business, and our stock price. If we become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or not, we will have to expend significant resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend our Company. This situation will be costly and time-consuming and distract our management from growing our Company.\nThe disclosures in our reports and other filings with the SEC and our other public announcements are not subject to the scrutiny of any regulatory bodies in the PRC. Accordingly, our public disclosure should be reviewed in light of the fact that no governmental agency that is located in the PRC, where part of our operations and business are located, has conducted any due diligence on our operations or reviewed or cleared any of our disclosure.\nWe are regulated by the SEC and our reports and other filings with the SEC are subject to SEC review in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. A material portion of our operations is located in the PRC. Since such operations and business take place outside of the United States, it may be more difficult for the staff of the SEC to overcome the geographic and cultural obstacles that are present when reviewing our disclosure. Furthermore, our SEC reports and other disclosure and public announcements are not subject to the review or scrutiny of any PRC regulatory authority. For example, the disclosure in our SEC reports and other filings is not subject to the review of the CSRC. Accordingly, you should review our SEC reports, filings, and our other public announcements with the understanding that no local regulator has done any due diligence on our Company and with the understanding that none of our SEC reports, other filings, or any of our other public announcements has been reviewed or otherwise been scrutinized by any local regulator.\nThe unavailability, reduction, or elimination of government and economic incentives or government policies that are favorable for new energy vehicles could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business has benefited from the PRC government subsidies, economic incentives, and government policies that support the growth of new EVs. For example, each qualified purchaser of our new energy vehicles enjoys subsidies from China\u2019s central government and certain local governments. Furthermore, in certain cities, quotas that limit the purchase of ICE vehicles do not apply to EVs, thereby incentivizing customers to purchase EVs. In April 2020, the MOF, together with several other PRC government departments, issued the Announcement on Exemption of Vehicle Purchase Tax, and the 2020 Financial Subsidies Circular, which extended certain subsidies and tax exemptions on EV purchases to the end of 2022. On December 31, 2021, the above mentioned authorities promulgated the 2022 Financial Subsidies Circular, which became effective on January 1, 2022.\nThese policies are subject to certain limits as well as changes that are beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that future changes, if any, would be favorable to our business. For instance, according to the 2020 Financial Subsidies Circular, in principle, the subsidies for new energy vehicles purchases from 2020 to 2022 will generally be lowered by 10%, 20%, and 30%, respectively, based on the level of the previous year with limited exceptions in the area of public transport, and the total number of new energy vehicles in China that will be entitled to such subsidies should be no more than two million each year. The 2022 Financial Subsidies Circular specifies that the subsidy standard of 2022 will be reduced by 30% compared to the subsidy standard of the previous year, and the financial subsidy policies applicable to new energy vehicles will be expired on December 31, 2022.\nAny reduction or elimination of government subsidies and economic incentives because of policy changes, fiscal tightening, or other factors may result in the diminished competitiveness of the EV industry generally or our Ideanomics China business unit in particular. In addition, as we seek to increase our revenues from vehicle sales, we may also experience an increase in accounts receivable relating to government subsidies. Any uncertainty or delay in collection of the government subsidies may also have an adverse impact on our financial condition. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe might be subject to the National Security Law in the future, in light of the PRC government\u2019s current and rapidly changing policies regarding PRC and Hong Kong businesses operations.\nOn June 30, 2020, the PRC government\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress Standing Committee passed the National Security Law for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The National Security Law criminalizes, and otherwise gives the PRC government broad powers to find unlawful, a broad variety of political crimes, including separatism and collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security in relation to Hong Kong. Under the National Security Law, the PRC government can, at its own discretion or the Hong Kong government\u2019s discretion, exercise jurisdiction over alleged violations of the law and prosecute and adjudicate cases in mainland China. The law can apply to alleged violations committed by anyone, anywhere in the world, including in the United States.\nIn light of the PRC government\u2019s current and rapidly changing policies regarding PRC and Hong Kong businesses operations, Ideanomics\u2019 business operations could be subject to the National Security Law in the future, if the PRC or Hong Kong government desires this outcome.\nIncreases in labor costs and enforcement of stricter labor laws and regulations in the PRC may adversely affect our business and our profitability.\nChina\u2019s overall economy and the average wage in China have increased in recent years and are expected to continue to grow. The average wage level for our employees has also increased in recent years. We expect that our labor costs, including wages and employee benefits, will increase. Unless we are able to pass on these increased labor costs to those who pay for our services, our profitability and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, we have been subject to stricter regulatory requirements in terms of entering into labor contracts with our employees, the utilization of labor dispatching, applying for foreigner work permits, labor protection and labor condition requirements, and the payment of various statutory employee benefits, including pensions, housing fund contributions, medical insurance, work-related injury insurance, unemployment insurance, and maternity insurance to designated government agencies for the benefit of our employees. Pursuant to the Labor Contract Law and its implementation rules, employers are also now generally subject to stricter requirements in terms of signing labor contracts, minimum wages, paying remuneration, determining the term of employee\u2019s probation, and unilaterally terminating labor contracts. In the event that we decide to terminate some of our employees or otherwise change our employment or labor practices, the Labor Contract Law and its implementation rules may limit our ability to effect those changes in a desirable or cost-effective manner, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAs the interpretation and implementation of labor-related laws and regulations are still evolving, our employment practices may violate labor-related laws and regulations in China, which may subject us to labor disputes or government investigations. We cannot assure you that we have complied or will be able to comply with all labor-related laws and regulations including those relating to obligations to make social insurance payments and contribute to the housing provident funds. If we are deemed to have violated relevant labor laws and regulations, we could be required to provide additional compensation to our employees, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nAlthough our audited financial statements are prepared by auditors that are currently subject to inspections by the PCAOB, there is no guarantee that future audit reports will be prepared by auditors that are subject to inspections by the PCAOB\nand, as such, future investors may be deprived of such inspections, which could result in limitations or restrictions to our access of the U.S. capital markets. Furthermore, trading in our securities may be prohibited under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act or the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act if the SEC subsequently determines our audit work is performed by auditors that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely, and as a result, U.S. national securities exchanges, such as the Nasdaq, may determine to delist our securities.\nAs an auditor of companies that are registered with the SEC and publicly traded in the United States and a firm registered with the PCAOB, our auditor is required under the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB to assess their compliance with the laws of the United States and professional standards. Although we have substantial operations within China, a jurisdiction where the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the Chinese government authorities, our auditor is currently inspected fully by the PCAOB.\nInspections of other auditors conducted by the PCAOB outside China have at times identified deficiencies in those auditors\u2019 audit procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. The lack of PCAOB inspections of audit work undertaken in China prevents the PCAOB from regularly evaluating auditors\u2019 audits and their quality control procedures. As a result, to the extent that any component of our auditor\u2019s work papers is or becomes located in China, such work papers will not be subject to inspection by the PCAOB. As a result, investors would be deprived of such PCAOB inspections, which could result in limitations or restrictions to our access to the U.S. capital markets.\nAs part of a continued regulatory focus in the United States on access to audit and other information currently protected by national law, in particular, China\u2019s, in June 2019, a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced bills in both houses of the U.S. Congress which, if passed, would require the SEC to maintain a list of issuers for which PCAOB is not able to inspect or investigate the audit work performed by a foreign public accounting firm completely. The proposed EQUITABLE Act prescribes increased disclosure requirements for these issuers and, beginning in 2025, the delisting from U.S. national securities exchanges such as the Nasdaq of issuers included on the SEC\u2019s list for three consecutive years. It is unclear if this proposed legislation will be enacted. On May 20, 2020, the U.S. Senate passed the HFCA Act, which includes requirements for the SEC to identify issuers whose audit work is performed by auditors that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a restriction imposed by a non-U.S. authority in the auditor\u2019s local jurisdiction. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the HFCA Act on December 2, 2020, and the HFCA Act was signed into law on December 18, 2020. Furthermore, on June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the AHFCA Act, which, if enacted, would amend the HFCA Act and require the SEC to prohibit an issuer\u2019s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of three. On September 22, 2021, the PCAOB adopted a final rule implementing the HFCA Act, which provides a framework for the PCAOB to use when determining, as contemplated under the HFCA Act, whether the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms located in a foreign jurisdiction because of a position taken by one or more authorities in that jurisdiction. The SEC adopted rules to implement the AHFCA Act and, pursuant to the AHFCA Act, the PCAOB has issued its report notifying the SEC of its determination that it is unable to inspect or investigate completely accounting firms headquartered in mainland China or Hong Kong.\nUnder the HFCA Act, our securities may be prohibited from trading on the Nasdaq or other U.S. stock exchanges if our auditor is not inspected by the PCAOB for three consecutive years, and this ultimately could result in our shares of common stock being delisted. While we understand that there has been dialogue among the CSRC, the SEC, and the PCAOB regarding the inspection of PCAOB-registered accounting firms in China, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the requirements imposed by U.S. regulators. Delisting of our common stock would force holders of our shares of common stock to sell their shares. The market price of our shares of common stock could be adversely affected as a result of anticipated negative impacts of these executive or legislative actions upon, as well as negative investor sentiment towards, companies with operations in China that are listed in the United States, regardless of whether these executive or legislative actions are implemented and regardless of our actual operating performance.\nUncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could adversely affect our liquidity.\nThe PRC legal system is based on statutes. Prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. Since 1979, PRC legislation and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, China has not developed a fully integrated legal system, and recently enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in China. Because these laws and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited volume of published decisions and their nonbinding nature, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve uncertainties. In addition, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules (some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all) that may have a retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation. In\naddition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.\nPRC regulation of loans and direct investment by offshore holding companies to PRC entities may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds of this offering to make loans or additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.\nGovernmental control of currency conversion may limit the Company\u2019s ability to utilize its cash balance effectively and affect the results of operations of our PRC subsidiaries.\nThe PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the Renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. Ideanomics receives a substantial amount of their revenues in Renminbi or, alternatively, to finance their PRC subsidiaries in Renminbi. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments, and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval of SAFE PRC by complying with certain procedural requirements. Specifically, under the existing exchange restrictions, without prior approval of SAFE PRC, cash generated from the operations of its PRC subsidiaries in China may be used to pay dividends to its company. However, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where Renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, Ideanomics will need to obtain SAFE PRC approval to use the cash generated from the operations of their PRC subsidiaries to pay off their respective debt in a currency other than Renminbi owed to entities outside China, or to make other capital expenditure payments outside China in a currency other than Renminbi. The PRC government may at its discretion restrict access to foreign currencies for current account transactions in the future. If the foreign exchange control system prevents Ideanomics from obtaining such approval or otherwise hinders efficient financial management of the PRC subsidiaries, it may substantially curtail our operations and cause the value of our securities significantly decline or become worthless.\nThe Chinese government may intervene or influence the operations of Ideanomics\u2019 business or the business of the combined company in the territory of PRC at any time, which could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our securities.\nMore than twenty percent (20%) of our revenues result from our operations in the PRC. The Chinese government may intervene or influence the operations of Ideanomics\u2019 business or the business of the combined company in the territory of PRC at any time, which could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our securities. Also, recent statements by the Chinese government have indicated an intent to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or over foreign investment in China-based and Hong Kong-based issuers. Any such action could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless.\nRisks Related to Anticipated Acquisition of VIA\nOur planned acquisition of VIA in accordance with the terms and conditions of the pertinent merger agreement as well as the merger agreement itself presents considerable uncertainties and risks including:\n\u2022our ability to obtain stockholder approval for the issuance of shares of common stock under the merger agreement and related proposals necessary to effect the merger;\n\u2022our ability to have the Registration Statement declared effective;\n\u2022the ability of the combined company to successfully maintain a Nasdaq Capital Market listing;\n\u2022the ability of the combined company to successfully access the capital markets and operate profitably;\n\u2022conditions to the closing of the merger may not be satisfied or the arrangement may involve unexpected costs, liabilities, or delays;\n\u2022the occurrence of any other risks to the consummation of the merger, including the risk that the merger will not be consummated within the expected time period or any event, change, or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement;\n\u2022risks that the anticipated merger disrupts our current plans and operations or that our business or stock price may suffer as a result of uncertainty surrounding the merger agreement and the Registration Statement; and\n\u2022we and/or the combined company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, or competitive factors.\nFor additional information on the risks associated with our proposed acquisition with VIA please review the risks beginning on page 23 of the Registration Statement which risks are incorporated by reference herein and included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report.", "PERMNO": 13412, "SIC": 6200, "TIC": "IDEX"}
