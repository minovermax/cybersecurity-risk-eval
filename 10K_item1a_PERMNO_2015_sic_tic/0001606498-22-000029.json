{"cik": "1606498", "company": "AVANOS MEDICAL, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-23", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business faces many risks and uncertainties. Any of the risks discussed below, as well as factors described in other places in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or in our other filings with the SEC, could materially adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, these items could cause our future results to differ from our recent results, from our anticipated future results and from those in any of our forward-looking statements. These risks are not the only ones we face. Other risks that we do not presently know about or that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact our business operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant volatility in the global financial markets, caused disruption in global supply and distribution channels, dramatically changed the way companies do business and may adversely impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWhile we are closely monitoring the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, we currently cannot quantify the impact it will have on our future results of operations. The ongoing impact of the pandemic depends on a number\nof factors which are uncertain and unpredictable, including the severity, extent and duration of the pandemic and the potential severe adverse financial impact the pandemic could have on our customers. Our future results of operations and cash flows may suffer material adverse effects from delays in payments on outstanding accounts receivable, potential manufacturing, distribution and supply chain disruptions and uncertain demand, and the effects of any actions we may take to address the financial and operational challenges our customers may face. Other pandemic-related risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022postponement or cancellation of elective medical procedures and uncertainty as to whether or when they will resume;\n\u2022potential temporary or prolonged office, production facility or distribution center closures;\n\u2022the health of our employees and our ability to meet our staffing needs;\n\u2022potential new or continued governmental actions that may limit our employees\u2019 ability to work;\n\u2022civil unrest relating to government, corporate and societal responses to the pandemic;\n\u2022volatility in economic conditions and the financial markets;\n\u2022risks associated with vaccine distribution; and\n\u2022other unanticipated effects that remain unknown.\nIf we experience any one of these risks or uncertainties, it may have a material adverse impact to our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The duration of any such impacts cannot be predicted because of the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, our business could be severely impacted by widespread regional, national or global health epidemics unrelated to COVID-19 in the future.\nWe face strong competition. Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur industry is highly competitive. We compete with many domestic and foreign companies ranging from small start-up enterprises that might sell only a single or limited number of competitive products or compete only in a specific market segment, to companies that are larger and more established than us, have a broad range of competitive products, participate in numerous markets and have access to significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do. We are also subject to potential competition from new technologies or new market entrants. Competitive factors include price, alternative clinical practices, innovation, quality and reputation. Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may not be successful in developing, acquiring or marketing competitive products and technologies.\nOur industry is characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological advances. The future success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to design, acquire and manufacture new competitive products and enhance existing products. Accordingly, we commit substantial time, funds and other resources to new product development, including research and development, acquisitions, licenses, clinical trials and physician education. We make these substantial expenditures without any assurance that our products will obtain regulatory clearance or reimbursement approval, acquire adequate intellectual property protection or receive market acceptance. Development by our competitors of improved products, technologies or enhancements may make our products, or those we develop, license or acquire in the future, obsolete or less competitive, which could negatively impact our net sales. Our failure to successfully develop, acquire or market competitive new products or enhance existing products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe cannot guarantee that any of our strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances will be successful.\nWe intend to supplement our growth through strategic acquisitions of, investments in and alliances with new medical technologies. The success of any acquisition, investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to identify and then properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate any business we may acquire into our existing business. These types of transactions may require more resources and investments than originally anticipated, may divert management\u2019s attention from our existing business, may result in exposure to unexpected liabilities of the acquired business, and may not result in the expected benefits, savings or synergies. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and successfully make strategic acquisitions of, investments in and alliances with new medical technologies or that any past or future acquisition, investment or alliance will be cost-effective, profitable or successful.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain key employees necessary to be competitive.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to attract and retain executives and other key employees, including people in technical, marketing, sales, and research and development positions. Competition for experienced employees, particularly for persons with specialized skills, can be intense. Our ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors, including compensation and benefits, work location and work environment. If we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nBreaches of our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. Our information technology systems may fail to perform as anticipated, and we may encounter difficulties in implementing new systems, adapting these systems to changing technologies or expanding them to meet the future needs and growth of our business. In addition, our information technology systems may be subjected to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunication failures, usage errors by our employees, security breaches, computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts and cyber- or phishing-attacks. We also store certain information with third parties that could be subject to these types of attacks. These attacks could result in our intellectual property and other confidential information, including personal health information, being lost or stolen, disruption of our operations, loss of reputation and other negative consequences, such as increased costs for security measures or remediation costs and diversion of management attention. While we will continue to implement additional protective measures to reduce the risk of and detect future cyber incidents, cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent, and the techniques used in such attacks change rapidly. There can be no assurances that our protective measures will prevent future attacks that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights or may infringe the intellectual property rights of others.\nWe rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property assets in the operation of our business. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient. We cannot be sure that pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or that patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid or prevent competitors from introducing similar competing technologies. Our ability to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside of the United States in which we operate, which could make it easier for our competitors to develop or distribute similar or superior competing technologies in those jurisdictions. In addition, our competitive position may be adversely affected by expirations of our significant patents, which would allow competitors to freely use our technology to compete with us.\nWe operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation and competitors may claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights. Resolution of patent litigation or other intellectual property claims is inherently unpredictable, typically time consuming and costly and can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of the affected products or require us to make significant royalty payments in order to continue selling the affected products. Any one of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. At any given time we are involved as either a plaintiff or a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. We can expect to face additional claims of patent infringement in the future.\nOur customers depend on third-party coverage and reimbursements. The failure of healthcare programs to provide coverage and reimbursement, or reductions in levels of reimbursement, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe ability of our customers to obtain coverage and reimbursements for products they purchase from us is important to our business. Demand for many of our existing and new medical products is, and will continue to be, affected by the extent to which government healthcare programs and private health insurers reimburse our customers for patients\u2019 medical expenses in the countries where we do business. Any reduction in the amount of reimbursements received by our customers could harm our business by reducing their selection of our products and the prices they are willing to pay.\nIn addition, as a result of their purchasing power, third-party payors are implementing cost-cutting measures such as seeking discounts, price reductions or other incentives from medical products suppliers and imposing limitations on coverage and reimbursements for medical technologies and procedures. These trends could compel us to reduce prices for our existing products and potential new products and could cause a decrease in the size of the market or a potential increase in competition that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAn inability to obtain key components, raw materials or manufactured products from third parties may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend on the availability of various components, raw materials and manufactured products supplied by others for our operations. If the capabilities of our suppliers and third-party manufacturers are limited or stopped, due to quality, regulatory or other reasons, including natural disasters, pandemics or other health emergencies (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), political instability, government actions, prolonged power or equipment failures or labor dispute, it could negatively impact our ability to manufacture or deliver our products and could expose us to regulatory actions. Further, for quality assurance or cost effectiveness, we purchase from sole suppliers certain components and raw materials. Although there are other sources in the market place for these items, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials due to regulations and requirements of the FDA and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products. The loss of any sole supplier or any sustained supply interruption that affects our ability to manufacture or deliver our\nproducts in a timely or cost effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAn interruption in our ability to manufacture products may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMany of our key products are manufactured at single locations, with limited alternate facilities. If one or more of these facilities experience damage, or if these manufacturing capabilities are otherwise limited or stopped due to quality, regulatory or other reasons, including natural disasters, pandemics or other health emergencies (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), political instability, government actions, prolonged power or equipment failures or labor dispute, it may not be possible to timely manufacture the relevant products at previous levels or at all. A reduction or interruption in any of these manufacturing processes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAn interruption in distribution or transportation may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on various transportation channels for global distribution of our products through shipping ports located throughout the world. Labor unrest, political instability, the outbreak of pandemics or other health emergencies (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), trade restrictions, transport capacity and costs, port security, weather conditions, natural disasters or other events could slow port activities and could adversely affect our business by interrupting product shipments and may increase our transportation costs if we are forced to use more expensive shipping alternatives.\nThe adoption and interpretation of tax laws may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe laws and rules and related interpretations dealing with income taxation are frequently reviewed and amended by governmental bodies, officials and regulatory agencies in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business. The governmental bodies may include the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Treasury Department, the U.S. Congress, taxing authorities in countries outside the U.S., and various state, provincial, local or municipal regulatory agencies. Our provision for income taxes and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of income and expenses in countries with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws, regulations or administrative interpretations thereof. For example, the U.S. federal government could make changes to existing U.S. tax laws, including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 or the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act of 2020, which could include an increase in the corporate tax rate and the tax rate on foreign earnings. It cannot be predicted whether, when, in what form, or with what effective dates, tax laws, regulations and rulings may be enacted, promulgated, issued or amended that could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe face significant uncertainty in the healthcare industry due to government healthcare reform in the United States and elsewhere.\nThe U.S. Congress, regulatory agencies and certain state legislatures, as well as international legislators and regulators, periodically review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methods with an objective of ultimately reducing healthcare costs and expanding access. We cannot predict with certainty what healthcare initiatives, if any, will be implemented by states or foreign governments or what ultimate effect healthcare reform or any future legislation or regulation may have on our customers\u2019 purchasing decisions regarding our products. However, the implementation of new legislation and regulation may lower reimbursements for our products, reduce medical procedure volumes and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation, which may require us to incur significant expenses to ensure compliance.\nMany of our products are subject to extensive regulation in the United States by the FDA and other regulatory authorities and by comparable government agencies in other countries concerning the development, design, approval, manufacture, labeling, importing and exporting and sale and marketing of many of our products. Furthermore, our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and other federal, state and foreign government authorities, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, which requires periodic audits, design controls, quality control testing and documentation procedures, as well as complaint evaluations and investigation. Regulations regarding the development, manufacture and sale of medical products are evolving and subject to future change. We cannot predict what impact those regulatory changes may have on our business. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could lead to manufacturing shutdowns, product shortages, delays in product manufacturing, product seizures, recalls, operating restrictions, withdrawal or suspension of required licenses, and prohibitions against exporting of products to, or importing products from, countries outside the United States and may require significant resources to resolve. Any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations that could result in significant liability, require us to change our business practices or restrict our operations in the future.\nWe are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act and anti-kickback and false claims laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. These laws and regulations are wide ranging and subject to changing interpretation and application, which could restrict our sales or marketing practices. Furthermore, since many of our customers rely on reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental programs to cover a substantial portion of their expenditures, our exclusion from such programs as a result of a violation of these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe must obtain clearance or approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities prior to introducing a new product or a modification to an existing product. The regulatory clearance process may result in substantial costs, delays and limitations on the types and uses of products we can bring to market, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn the United States, before we can market a new product, or market a new use of, or claim for, or significant modification to, an existing product, we generally must first receive clearance or approval from the FDA and certain other regulatory authorities. Most major markets for medical devices outside the United States also require clearance, approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed. The process of obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming, involve rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing, require changes in products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of products. There can be no assurance that these clearances and approvals will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, once a medical device has been cleared or approved, a new clearance or approval may be required before the medical device may be modified, its labeling changed or marketed for a different use. Medical devices are cleared or approved for one or more specific intended uses and promoting a device for an off-label use could result in government enforcement action. Furthermore, a product approval or clearance can be withdrawn or limited due to unforeseen problems with the medical device or issues relating to its application. The regulatory clearance and approval process may result in, among other things, delayed, if at all, realization of product net sales, substantial additional costs and limitations on the types of products we may bring to market or their indicated uses, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may incur product liability losses, litigation liability, product recalls, safety alerts or regulatory action associated with our products which can be costly and disruptive to our business.\nThe risk of product liability claims is inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical products of the type we produce and sell. A number of factors could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient with respect to the products that we manufacture or sell, including the physician\u2019s skill, technique and experience in performing the relevant surgical procedure, component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or information.\nIn addition to product liability claims and litigation, an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient associated with our products could lead to a recall of, or issuance of a safety alert relating to, our products, or suspension or delay of regulatory product approvals or clearances, product seizures or detentions, governmental investigations, civil or criminal sanctions or injunctions to halt manufacturing and distribution of our products. Any one of these could result in significant costs and negative publicity resulting in reduced market acceptance and demand for our products and harm our reputation. In addition, a recall or injunction affecting our products could temporarily shut down production lines or place products on a shipping hold.\nAll of the foregoing types of legal proceedings and regulatory actions are inherently unpredictable and, regardless of the outcome, could disrupt our business, result in substantial costs or the diversion of management attention and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nEconomic conditions have affected and may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nDisruptions in the financial markets and other macro-economic challenges affecting the economy and the economic outlook of the United States, Europe, Japan, China and other parts of the world may have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Economic conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending have caused and may continue to cause our customers to reduce, modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products, and we have observed certain hospitals delaying and prioritizing purchasing decisions, which has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition, as a result of economic conditions, our customers inside and outside the United States, including foreign governmental entities or other entities that rely on government healthcare systems or government funding, may be unable to pay their obligations on a timely basis or to make payment in full. If our customers\u2019 cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorate or fail to improve, or if our customers are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of accounts receivable owed to us. These conditions also may have an adverse\neffect on certain of our suppliers who may reduce output or change terms of sales, which could cause a disruption in our ability to produce our products. Any inability of current and/or potential customers to pay us for our products or any demands by our suppliers for different payment terms may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nDue to our international operations, we transact business in many foreign currencies and are subject to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including the Mexican peso, Japanese yen, Australian dollar and the Euro. Our financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars with international transactions being translated into U.S. dollars. If the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of other countries where we sell our products, our U.S. dollar reported net sales and income will decrease. Additionally, we incur significant costs in foreign currencies and a fluctuation in those currencies\u2019 value can negatively impact manufacturing and selling costs. While we have in the past engaged, and may in the future engage, in various hedging transactions in attempts to minimize the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that these hedging transactions will be effective. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur regularly and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to price fluctuations of key commodities, which may negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe rely on product inputs in the manufacture of our products. Prices of oil and gas affect our distribution and transportation costs. Prices of these commodities are volatile and have fluctuated significantly in recent years, which has contributed to, and in the future may continue to contribute to, fluctuations in our results of operations. Our ability to hedge commodity price volatility is limited. Furthermore, due to competitive dynamics, the cost containment efforts of our customers and third-party payors, and contractual limitations, particularly with respect to products we sell under group purchasing agreements, which generally set pricing for a three-year term, we may be unable to pass along commodity-driven cost increases through higher prices. If we cannot fully offset cost increases through other cost reductions, or recover these costs through price increases or surcharges, we could experience lower margins and profitability which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nCost-containment efforts of our customers, healthcare purchasing groups, third-party payors and governmental organizations could adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nMany of our customers are members of GPOs, or integrated delivery networks (\u201cIDNs\u201d). GPOs and IDNs negotiate pricing arrangements with healthcare product manufacturers and distributors and offer the negotiated prices to affiliated hospitals and other members. Although we are the sole contracted supplier to certain GPOs for certain product categories, members of the GPO are generally free to purchase from other suppliers, and such contract positions can offer no assurance that sales volumes of those products will be maintained. In addition, initiatives sponsored by government agencies and other third-party payors to limit healthcare costs, including price regulation and competitive bidding for the sale of our products, are ongoing in markets where we sell our products. Pricing pressure has also increased in our markets due to consolidation among healthcare providers, trends toward managed care, governments becoming payors of healthcare expenses and regulation relating to reimbursements. The increasing leverage of organized buying groups and consolidated customers and pricing pressure from third-party payors may reduce market prices for our products, thereby reducing our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to political, economic and regulatory risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.\nMost of our manufacturing facilities are outside the United States in Mexico. We also may use contract manufacturers outside the United States from time to time and may source many of our raw materials and components from foreign suppliers. We distribute and sell our products in over 90 countries. In 2021, approximately 25% of our net sales were generated outside of North America and we expect this percentage will grow over time. Our operations outside of the United States are subject to risks that are inherent in conducting business internationally, including compliance with both United States and foreign laws and regulations that apply to our international operations. These laws and regulations include robust data privacy requirements, labor relations laws that may impede employer flexibility, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import, customs and trade restrictions, export requirements, economic sanction laws, environmental, health and safety laws, anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions. Given the high level of complexity of these laws, there is a risk that some provisions may be violated inadvertently or through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise. In addition, these laws are subject to changes, which may require additional resources or make it more difficult for us to comply with these laws. Violations of the laws and regulations governing our international operations could result in fines or criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to manufacture or distribute our products in one or more countries and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business,\nresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and prevent or mitigate these risks and manage difficulties as they arise.\nWe may be subject to trade protection measures that are being contemplated by the United States Government and other governments around the world, as well as potential disruptions in trade agreements, such as the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU. These measures and disruptions may result in new or higher tariffs, import-export restrictions and taxes. Changes in, or revised interpretations of import-export laws or international trade agreements, along with new or increased tariffs, trade restrictions or taxation on income earned or goods manufactured outside the United States may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition to the foregoing, engaging in international business inherently involves a number of other difficulties and risks, including:\n\u2022different local medical practices, product preferences and product requirements,\n\u2022price and currency controls and exchange rate fluctuations,\n\u2022cost and availability of international shipping channels,\n\u2022longer payment cycles in certain countries other than the United States,\n\u2022minimal or diminished protection of intellectual property in certain countries,\n\u2022uncertainties regarding judicial systems, including difficulties in enforcing agreements through certain non-U.S. legal systems,\n\u2022political instability and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts, expropriation of assets, economic instability and the impact on interest rates, inflation and the credit worthiness of our customers, and\n\u2022difficulties and costs of staffing and managing non-U.S. operations.\nThese risks and difficulties, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may need additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs or to make acquisitions and such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nWe intend to continue our research and development activities and make acquisitions. Accordingly, we may need to seek additional debt or equity financing. We may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our expansion, successfully develop or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Avanos Common Stock\nWe cannot guarantee that our stock price will not decline or fluctuate significantly.\nThe price at which Avanos common stock trades has and may continue to fluctuate significantly. The market price, or fluctuations in price, for Avanos common stock may be negatively influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022actual or unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results,\n\u2022our failure to achieve the quarterly financial results expected by the securities analysts who cover our stock,\n\u2022the outcome of litigation and enforcement actions,\n\u2022developments generally affecting the healthcare industry,\n\u2022changes in market valuations of comparable companies,\n\u2022the amount of our indebtedness,\n\u2022general economic, industry and market conditions,\n\u2022the depth and liquidity of the market for Avanos common stock,\n\u2022price fluctuations in key commodities,\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors regarding performance, strategy, significant acquisitions, divestitures, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments,\n\u2022fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates,\n\u2022our dividend policy, and\n\u2022perceptions of or speculations by the press or investment community.\nThese and other factors may lower the market price of Avanos common stock, regardless of our actual financial condition or operating performance.\nWe have no present intention to pay dividends on Avanos common stock.\nWe have no present intention to pay dividends on Avanos common stock. Any determination to pay dividends to holders of Avanos common stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, projections, liquidity, earnings, legal requirements, restrictions in our debt agreements and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant.\nThe percentage of ownership of existing stockholders in Avanos may be diluted in the future.\nIn the future, a stockholder\u2019s percentage ownership in Avanos may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including equity awards that we may grant to our directors, officers and employees. In addition, our compensation committee has, and we anticipate that they will continue in the future to, grant stock options or other equity based awards to our employees. These awards will have a dilutive effect on existing stockholders and on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of shares of Avanos common stock.\nIn addition, our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of Avanos stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over Avanos common stock with respect to dividends and distributions, as our Board of Directors generally may determine. If our Board of Directors were to approve the issuance of preferred stock in the future, the terms of one or more classes or series of such preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of Avanos common stock. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to Avanos preferred stock could affect the residual value of Avanos common stock.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation may make it difficult for stockholders to initiate litigation against us in a favorable forum for disputes with us or our directors or officers.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or if that court does not have jurisdiction, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware) as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors or officers.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and of Delaware law may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our Board of Directors and may discourage hostile takeover attempts which some of our stockholders may consider to be beneficial.\nCertain provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and those contained in Delaware law may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our Board of Directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of us and our stockholders. These provisions include, among other things, the following:\n\u2022the division of our Board of Directors into three classes, each with three-year staggered terms, although shareholders voted in 2020 to declassify our Board, and it will be fully declassified in 2023,\n\u2022the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms, including preferences and voting rights, of those shares without stockholder approval,\n\u2022the inability of our stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders,\n\u2022stockholder action may be taken only at a special or regular meeting of stockholders,\n\u2022advance notice procedures for nominating candidates to our Board of Directors or presenting matters at stockholder meetings,\n\u2022stockholder removal of directors only for cause and only by a supermajority vote,\n\u2022the ability of our Board of Directors, and not our stockholders, to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors, and\n\u2022supermajority voting requirements to amend our by-laws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and to engage in certain types of business combinations.\nWhile these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of our company to negotiate with our Board of Directors, they could enable the Board of Directors to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some, or a majority, of the stockholders might believe to be in their best interests and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. We are also subject to Delaware laws that could have similar effects. One of these laws prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with a significant stockholder unless specific conditions are met.", "PERMNO": 14941, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "AVNS"}
