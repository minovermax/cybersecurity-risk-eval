{"cik": "33619", "company": "ESTERLINE TECHNOLOGIES CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-11-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to the Merger\nThe proposed Merger is subject to conditions, some or all of which may not be satisfied or completed within the expected timeframe, if at all. Failure to complete the proposed Merger could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock.\nThe completion of the Merger is subject to a number of conditions, including, among other things, receipt of the approval of the shareholders and of certain regulatory and foreign investment approvals. A governmental entity or a regulatory body may prohibit, delay or refuse to grant approval for the consummation of the Merger and may require conditions, limitations or restrictions in connection with such approvals in excess of the thresholds and limitations that TransDigm agreed to in the Merger Agreement. There can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the Merger will be satisfied or waived within the expected timeframe, or that the Merger will be completed. Failure to complete the Merger could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock in a number of ways, including:\n\u2022\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated and our Board of Directors seeks another business combination, our shareholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to enter into a transaction on terms equivalent to or more attractive than the terms that TransDigm has agreed to in the Merger Agreement;\n\u2022\nThe merger agreement may be terminated in certain circumstances that require us to pay TransDigm a termination fee of $128,855,000;\n\u2022\nThe time and resources, financial and other, committed by our management to matters relating to the Merger that could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities;\n\u2022\nWe may experience negative reactions from the financial markets or from our key business relationships, including our customers, suppliers, or employees; and\n\u2022\nWe will be required to pay certain costs relating to the Merger, whether or not the Merger is completed.\nThe announcement and pendency of the proposed Merger could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe announcement and pendency of the proposed Merger could disrupt our business and create uncertainty about it, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, regardless of whether the Merger is completed. These risks to our business, all of which could be exacerbated by a delay in the consummation of the Merger, include, among other things:\n\u2022\nThe fact that the Merger Agreement contains restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completing the Merger which could delay or prevent us from undertaking business opportunities that may arise or taking other actions with respect to its operations that we might believe were otherwise appropriate or desirable;\n\u2022\nThe time and effort of management required to consummate the merger, which could disrupt our business operations and may divert employees\u2019 attention away from our day-to-day operations;\n\u2022\nPotential uncertainty in the marketplace, which could lead current and prospective customers to purchase from other vendors or delay purchasing from us;\n\u2022\nOur current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles following the consummation of the proposed Merger, which may impair our ability to attract and retain key personnel;\n\u2022\nDifficulties maintaining relationships or contractual arrangements with customers, providers, suppliers, joint venture partners and regulators;\n\u2022\nThe fact that the Merger Agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for us to be acquired by any party other than TransDigm, and restricts us from soliciting other acquisition proposals during the pendency of the merger; and\n\u2022\nPotential future stockholder litigation relating to the merger could prevent or delay the merger, and the related costs, including, but not limited to, costs associated with the indemnification of directors and officers.\nOur important business relationships may be disrupted due to uncertainties associated with the proposed Merger, which could adversely affect our business.\nSome of the parties with which we do or desire to do business with may be uncertain about continuing or completing a business relationship with us as a result of the proposed Merger. For example, customers, partners, resellers, vendors, suppliers, joint\nventure partners and others may attempt to negotiate changes in their existing business relationships with us on terms that are less favorable to us, or may not enter into business relationships with us, or they may consider canceling or not renewing a business relationship or contract with us, or they may enter into alternative business relationships with other parties. Some of our customers, partners, resellers, vendors, suppliers, joint venture partners and others may have rights to terminate contracts that are triggered upon completion of the proposed Merger, and may exercise their rights and remedies that may exist under current agreements. These disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Any delay in completion of the Merger, or termination of the Merger Agreement, could exacerbate these risks and adverse effects.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Our Industry\nWe identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting at our Sensors & Systems power systems business unit which could, if not remediated, adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in applicable rules under the Exchange Act. In Part II, Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Form 10-K, our management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nThe assessment was based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. We have developed a remediation plan designed to address the material weaknesses, but our remediation efforts are not complete and are ongoing. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses, or if additional material weaknesses in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, it may materially adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner. If we are unable to report our results in a timely and accurate manner, we may not be able to comply with the applicable covenants in our financing arrangements, and may be required to seek additional waivers or repay amounts under these financing arrangements earlier than anticipated, which could adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition.\nAlthough we review and evaluate internal control systems to allow management to report on the sufficiency of our internal controls, we cannot assure you that we will not discover additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. The next time we evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, if we identify one or more new material weaknesses or are unable to timely remediate our existing weaknesses, we may be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nThe loss of a significant customer or defense program could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nSome of our operations are dependent on a relatively small number of customers and aerospace and defense programs, which change from time to time. Significant customers in fiscal 2018 included The Boeing Company, Flame, General Electric, Hawker Beechcraft, Honeywell, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Rolls-Royce, the DoD, and UTC Aerospace Systems. There can be no assurance that our current significant customers will continue to buy our products at current levels. The loss of a significant customer or the cancellation of orders related to a sole-source defense program could have a material adverse effect on our operating results if we were unable to replace the related sales.\nOur revenues and operating results are subject to fluctuations that may cause our operating results to decline.\nOur business is susceptible to seasonality, economic cycles and changes to business conditions, and as a result, our operating results have fluctuated widely in the past and are likely to continue to do so. Our revenue tends to fluctuate based on a number of market factors, including domestic and foreign economic conditions and developments affecting the specific industries and customers we serve. For example, it is possible that a global recession could occur and result in a more severe downturn in commercial aviation and defense. In addition, our operating and financial results are impacted by acquisitions, divestitures or adverse business developments. Our ability to effectively manage our portfolio of businesses and our business operations as well as respond to business changes will have an impact on our financial and operating results.\nIt is also possible that in the future our operating results in a particular quarter or quarters will not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, causing the market price of our common stock or senior notes to decline. We believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance and should not be relied upon to predict our future performance.\nWe may be unable to realize expected benefits from our business integration efforts and our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected.\nIn 2014 we began to consolidate certain facilities to create greater cost efficiencies through shared services in sales, general administration and support functions across our segments. In fiscal 2018 we continued to focus on achieving direct and indirect overhead reductions, improving our operational efficiencies at our facilities and developing shared services. These integration activities are intended to generate operating expense savings through direct and indirect overhead expense reductions as well as other savings and realizing these savings may be difficult. If we do not successfully manage our continuing integration activities, or any other similar activities that we may undertake in the future, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. Risks associated with these actions include inability to complete or delay in the planned transfer of business activities to other locations due to dependency on third-party agreements or certification of projects affected by the transfer, unanticipated costs in implementing the initiatives, delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, adverse effects on employee morale, creation of customer or supplier uncertainty that may impact our business, and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees. If any of these risks are realized, our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions may be impaired or our business may otherwise be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nWe are subject to numerous regulatory requirements for the export and sale of our products and services worldwide that could adversely affect our business.\nWe are also subject to a variety of U.S. and international export control laws and regulations such as the EAR and ITAR, which generally restrict the export of defense products, technology, technical data and defense services. Our trade activities are also subject to international sanctions that significantly restrict or prohibit the sale of certain goods and services in specified countries, including Russia, in which our customers operate or support programs. Our failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in penalties, loss, or suspension of contracts or other consequences. In addition, we may need to hold shipments or expend significant resources to re-work, re-design or re-certify our products to achieve compliance with applicable export control regulations. If we are required to take any of these measures, we may lose revenue opportunities, expend significant resources and/or be exposed to late-delivery penalties or other claims from our customers. Any of these could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. In September 2017, the Consent Agreement with the DTCC arising from our earlier handling of ITAR-controlled transactions, including the substance of prior voluntary disclosures and other aspects of ITAR compliance errors was closed.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials and non-governmental commercial parties for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. In particular, we may be held liable for actions taken by our strategic or local partners even though our partners are not subject to these laws. Any determination that we have violated the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act or similar laws could result in sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nOur financial performance may be adversely affected by information system business disruptions or failures.\nOur business may be impacted by information technology attacks or system failures. Cybersecurity attacks, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. We have experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past and may experience them in the future, potentially with more frequency. In addition, we have numerous, unique communications, data management and operations support systems across our enterprise that require expertise and significant resources to maintain and upgrade. We have taken measures to mitigate potential risks to our information technology and systems and are implementing plans to modernize and upgrade our systems, in part to comply with U.S. government contracting requirements and with the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation. However, our plans to upgrade our systems will take time to deploy across our enterprise and the timing, nature and scope of system disruptions and failures are unpredictable. As a result, we may experience production downtimes, operational delays or other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers. Our ability to collect and report financial information from our businesses may be impacted. The compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, or other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks could occur. We may also experience financial losses from remedial actions, including significant expenditures to restore or replace systems, loss of business or potential liability under contracts or pursuant to regulations that require us to maintain confidential and other data securely, and/or damage to our reputation. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nOur future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairment charges.\nWe are required to test both acquired goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach, rather than amortizing them over time. We have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value.\nAs we have grown through acquisitions, we have accumulated $1.0 billion of goodwill, $40.4 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets, and $265.7 million of definite-lived intangible assets, out of total assets of $3.0 billion at September 28, 2018. As a result, the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken.\nWe performed our annual impairment review for fiscal 2018 as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter, and our review indicated that no impairment of goodwill or other indefinite-lived assets exists at any of our reporting units.\nReductions in defense spending could adversely affect our business.\nApproximately 30% of our business is dependent upon defense spending. The defense industry is dependent upon the level of equipment expenditures by the armed forces of countries around the world, and especially those of the United States, which represent a significant portion of worldwide defense expenditures. Reductions in defense spending in 2019 and beyond are possible, which could have significant future consequences to our business, including termination or disruption of programs and personnel reductions that could impact our manufacturing operations and engineering capabilities.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities and a higher effective tax rate.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate is influenced by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, modification on tax policy, interpretation of existing tax laws, and our ability to sustain our reporting positions on examination. Any adverse changes in those factors could have a negative effect on our effective tax rate and financial results.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings.\nThe SEC recognized that a company\u2019s review of certain income tax effects of the Act may be incomplete at the time financial statements are issued. Accordingly, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, which provides that if a company does not have the necessary information available for certain effects of the Act, the Company may record provisional numbers and adjust those amounts during the measurement period not to extend beyond one year.\nAs of the date of this filing, we had not completed the accounting for the tax effects of the Act; however, in certain cases, as described below, we made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. In other cases, we were not able to make a reasonable estimate and continued to account for those items based on our existing accounting under ASC 740, Income Taxes, and the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to enactment. For the items for which we were able to determine a reasonable estimate, we estimated a provisional amount of $49.9 million. In all cases, we will continue to make and refine the calculations as additional analysis is completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. In addition, the estimates may also be affected by further rules and interpretations of the Act.\nIn addition, foreign governments have introduced proposals for changes in tax legislation, or have adopted tax laws in response to the guidelines provided by the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development to address base erosion and profit shifting. These changes will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact our effective tax rate.\nOur operations depend on our production facilities throughout the world. These production facilities are subject to physical and other risks that could disrupt production.\nOur production facilities could be damaged or disrupted by a natural disaster, war, political unrest, terrorist activity or a pandemic. In addition, our facilities are subject to local labor conditions that may lead to labor strikes, work stoppages or high levels of employee turnover that could also disrupt our business operations. Several of our production facilities are located in California, and thus are in areas with above average seismic activity and may also be at risk of damage in wildfires. Although we have obtained property damage and business interruption insurance for our production facilities, a major catastrophe such as an earthquake or other natural disaster at any of our sites, or significant labor strikes, work stoppage, political unrest, war or terrorist activities in any of the areas where we conduct operations, could result in a prolonged interruption of our business. Any disruption\nresulting from these events could cause significant delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers. We cannot assure you that we will have insurance to adequately compensate us for any of these events.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively.\nOur products and services are affected by varying degrees of competition. We compete with other companies and divisions and units of larger companies in most markets we serve, many of which have greater sales volumes or financial, technological or marketing resources than we do. Our principal competitors include: Astronautics, BAE, Bose, Eaton, ECE, Elbit, EMS, GE Aerospace, Honeywell, IAI, L-3, Otto Controls, RAFI, SELEX, Telephonics, Thales, Ultra Electronics, United Technologies Corporation, and Universal Avionics Systems Corporation in our Avionics & Controls segment; Ametek, Amphenol, Astronics, Honeywell, Kulite, Meggitt, Safran, TE Connectivity and United Technologies Corporation in our Sensors & Systems segment; and Chemring, Doncasters, Hi-Temp, J&M, JPR Hutchinson, Kmass, Meggitt (including Dunlop Standard Aerospace Group), Rheinmetall, Trelleborg, ULVA, UMPCO, and UTC Aerospace Systems in our Advanced Materials segment. The principal competitive factors in the commercial markets in which we participate are product performance, on-time delivery performance, quality, service and price. Maintaining product performance requires expenditures in research and development that lead to product improvement and new product introduction. Companies with more substantial financial resources may have a better ability to make such expenditures. The business model for some of our businesses is based upon access to the aftermarket and its premium pricing over OEM pricing. The strategic goal of our major OEM customers is to increase their access to the aftermarket from their supplier base, which would correspondingly decrease our sales to aftermarket customers. We cannot assure that we will be able to continue to successfully compete in our markets, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe amount of debt we have outstanding, as well as any debt we may incur in the future, could have an adverse effect on our operational and financial flexibility.\nAs of September 28, 2018, we had approximately $654.9 million of long-term debt outstanding, including a credit facility and $17.5 million in current maturities of long-term debt. The credit facility is secured by substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets.\nOur level of debt could have significant consequences to our business, including the following:\n\u2022\nDepending on interest rates and debt maturities, a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be dedicated to paying principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for our acquisition strategy, capital expenditures or other purposes, including repurchases of outstanding shares of common stock, depending on market conditions, share price and other factors;\n\u2022\nA significant amount of debt could make us more vulnerable to changes in economic conditions or increases in prevailing interest rates;\n\u2022\nOur ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions, capital expenditures or for other purposes could be impaired;\n\u2022\nThe increase in the amount of debt we have outstanding increases the risk of non-compliance with some of the covenants in our debt agreements which require us to maintain specified financial ratios; and\n\u2022\nWe may be more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may result in a competitive disadvantage.\nPolitical and economic changes in foreign countries and markets, including foreign currency fluctuations, may have a material effect on our operating results.\nForeign sales originating from non-U.S. locations were approximately 51% of our total sales in fiscal 2018, and we have manufacturing facilities in a number of foreign countries. A substantial portion of our Avionics & Controls operations is based in Belgium, Canada and the U.K., and a substantial portion of our Sensors & Systems operations is based in France and the U.K. We also have manufacturing operations in China, the Dominican Republic, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, and Morocco. Doing business in foreign countries is subject to numerous risks, including political and economic instability, restrictive trade policies of foreign governments, changes in the local labor-relations climate, economic conditions in local markets, health concerns, inconsistent product regulations or unexpected changes in regulatory and other legal requirements by foreign agencies or governments, the imposition of product tariffs and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of international and U.S. export laws and differing regulatory requirements. U.S. international trade policy is uncertain under the new administration, including, for example, the government\u2019s decision to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which could cause an increase in customs duties that in turn could adversely affect intercompany transactions among Esterline\u2019s operating subsidiaries in Canada, Mexico and the U.S., and increase transaction costs with third-party suppliers and customers. Further, the U.K. voter approval of an exit from the EU, known as \u201cBrexit,\u201d caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations and may create further global economic uncertainty that may adversely impact the economies of the U.K., the EU and other nations in which we conduct business. To the extent that foreign sales are transacted in a foreign currency, we are subject to the risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations. In addition, we have substantial assets denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound, Canadian dollar and euro, that are not offset by liabilities\ndenominated in those foreign currencies. These net foreign currency investments are subject to material changes in the event of fluctuations in foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar.\nA global recession may adversely affect our business operations and results, capital, and cost of capital.\nIn the event of a global recession, our customers may choose to delay or postpone purchases from us until the economy and their businesses strengthen. Decisions by current or future customers to forgo or defer purchases and/or our customers\u2019 inability to pay for our products may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. A recession could also adversely affect our future cost of debt and equity. Any inability to obtain adequate financing from debt and equity sources could force us to self-fund strategic initiatives or even forgo some opportunities, potentially harming our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nA downturn in the aircraft market could adversely affect our business.\nThe aerospace industry is cyclical in nature and affected by periodic downturns that are beyond our control. The principal customers for manufacturers of commercial aircraft are the commercial and regional airlines, which can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including a recession, increasing fuel and labor costs, intense price competition, outbreak of infectious disease and terrorist attacks, as well as economic cycles, all of which can be unpredictable and are outside our control. Any decrease in demand resulting from a downturn in the market could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur backlog is subject to modification or termination, which may reduce our sales in future periods.\nWe currently have a backlog of orders based on our contracts with customers. Under many of our contracts, our customers may unilaterally modify or terminate their orders at any time. In addition, the maximum contract value specified under a government contract awarded to us is not necessarily indicative of the sales that we will realize under that contract. For example, we are a sole-source prime contractor for many different military programs with the U.S. DoD. We depend heavily on the government contracts underlying these programs. Over its lifetime, a program may be implemented by the award of many different individual contracts and subcontracts. The funding of government programs is subject to congressional appropriation.\nChanges in defense procurement models may make it more difficult for us to successfully bid on projects as a prime contractor and limit sole-source opportunities available to us.\nIn recent years the trend in combat system design and development appears to be evolving toward the technological integration of various battlefield components, including combat vehicles, command and control network communications, advanced technology artillery systems and robotics. If the U.S. military procurement approach continues to require this kind of overall battlefield combat system integration, we expect to be subject to increased competition from aerospace and defense companies which have significantly greater resources than we do.\nWe may lose money or generate less than expected profits on our contracts, including our fixed-price contracts.\nOur customers set demanding specifications for product performance, reliability and cost. Some of our government contracts and subcontracts provide for a predetermined, fixed price for the products we make regardless of the costs we incur. Therefore, we must absorb cost overruns, notwithstanding the difficulty of estimating all of the costs we will incur in performing these contracts and in projecting the ultimate level of sales that we may achieve. Our failure to accurately scope the statement of work, anticipate technical problems, estimate costs accurately, integrate technical processes effectively, reduce dependency on sole-source or poor-performing suppliers, control costs or otherwise meet contractual obligations such as timely delivery and meeting quality specifications during performance of a contract may reduce the profitability or cause a loss on the contract. While we believe that we have recorded adequate provisions in our financial statements for losses on our fixed-price and other contracts as required under GAAP, we cannot assure that our contract loss provisions will be adequate to cover all actual future losses. Therefore, we may incur losses on contracts that we had expected to be profitable, or such contracts may be less profitable than expected.\nOur business is subject to government contracting regulations, and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our operating results and prospects.\nWe estimate that approximately 21% of our sales in fiscal 2018 were attributable to contracts in which we were either the prime contractor to, or a subcontractor to a prime contractor to, the U.S. government. As a contractor and subcontractor to the U.S. government, we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, security, administration and performance of federal government contracts that affect how we do business with our customers and may impose added costs to our business. For example, these regulations and laws include provisions that contracts we have been awarded are subject to:\n\u2022\nProtest or challenge by unsuccessful bidders;\n\u2022\nUnilateral termination, reduction or modification in the event of changes in government requirements; and\n\u2022\nSignificant data security requirements for our information systems.\nThe accuracy and appropriateness of certain costs and expenses used to substantiate our direct and indirect costs for the U.S. government under both cost-plus and fixed-price contracts are subject to extensive regulation and audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency, an arm of the U.S. DoD. Responding to governmental audits, inquiries or investigations may involve significant expense and divert management attention. Our failure to comply with these or other government procurement laws and regulations could result in contract termination, suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government, loss of opportunities to participate in future government programs, civil fines and damages, and criminal prosecution and penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nA significant portion of our business depends on U.S. government contracts, which are often subject to competitive bidding, and a failure to compete effectively or accurately anticipate the success of future projects could adversely affect our business.\nWe obtain many of our U.S. government contracts through a competitive bidding process that subjects us to risks associated with:\n\u2022\nThe frequent need to bid on programs in advance of the completion of their design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and/or cost overruns;\n\u2022\nThe substantial time and effort, including design, development and marketing activities, required to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us; and\n\u2022\nThe design complexity and rapid rate of technological advancement of defense-related products.\nIn addition, in order to win the award of developmental programs, we must be able to align our research and development and product offerings with the government\u2019s changing concepts of national defense and defense systems. The government\u2019s termination of, or failure to fully fund, one or more of the contracts for our programs would have a negative impact on our operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, we serve as a subcontractor on several military programs that, in large part, involve the same risks as prime contracts.\nOverall, we rely on key contracts with U.S. government entities for a significant portion of our sales and business. A substantial reduction in these contracts would materially adversely affect our operating results and financial position.\nThe market for our products may be affected by our ability to adapt to technological change.\nThe rapid change of technology is a key feature of all of the markets in which our businesses operate. To succeed in the future, we will need to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market, and support new products and enhancements to our existing products in a timely and cost-effective manner. Historically, our technology has been developed through internal research and development expenditures, as well as customer-sponsored research and development programs. There is no guarantee that we will continue to maintain, or benefit from, comparable levels of research and development in the future. In addition, our competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than those we develop or that render our technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive. Furthermore, our products could become unmarketable if new industry standards emerge. We cannot assure that our existing products will not require significant modifications in the future to remain competitive or that new products we introduce will be accepted by our customers, nor can we assure that we will successfully identify new opportunities, continue to have the needed financial resources to develop new products in a timely or cost-effective manner, or execute on a research and development program effectively to yield an expected return or any return on investment.\nThe airline industry is heavily regulated and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements, our results of operations could suffer.\nGovernmental agencies throughout the world, including the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components, including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products, as well as regulations regarding the repair and overhaul of aircraft engines. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries. We include, with the replacement parts that we sell to our customers, documentation certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. In order to sell our products, we and the products we manufacture, must also be certified by our individual OEM customers. If any of the material authorizations or approvals qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended, then the sale of the subject product would be prohibited by law, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations, which are usually more stringent than existing regulations. If these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted, we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe depend on the continued contributions of our executive officers and other key management, each of whom would be difficult to replace.\nOur future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior management and our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified management personnel. We face competition for management from other companies and organizations. Therefore, we may not be able to retain our existing management personnel or fill new management positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover at our existing compensation levels. Although we have entered into change of control agreements with members of senior management, we do not have employment contracts with our key executives, nor have we purchased \u201ckey-person\u201d insurance on the lives of any of our key officers or management personnel to reduce the impact to our company that the loss of any of them would cause. Specifically, the loss of any of our executive officers would disrupt our operations and divert the time and attention of our remaining officers, and failure to attract and retain highly qualified management personnel would damage our business prospects. In addition, our current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles following the announcement of the proposed Merger, which may impair our ability to attract and retain key personnel prior to the consummation of the proposed Merger.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, the value of our products could be diminished.\nOur success is dependent in part on obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our proprietary rights and our ability to avoid infringing on the proprietary rights of others. While we take precautionary steps to protect our technological advantages and intellectual property and rely in part on patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws, we cannot assure that the precautionary steps we have taken will completely protect our intellectual property rights. Because patent applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy until either the patent application is published or a patent is issued, we may not be aware of third-party patents, patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our products that may block our use of our intellectual property or may be used in third-party products that compete with our products and processes. In the event a competitor successfully challenges our products, processes, patents or licenses or claims that we have infringed upon their intellectual property, we could incur substantial litigation costs defending against such claims, be required to pay royalties, license fees or other damages or be barred from using the intellectual property at issue, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIn addition to our patent rights, we also rely on unpatented technology, trade secrets and confidential information. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques or otherwise gain access to or disclose our technology. We may not be able to protect our rights in unpatented technology, trade secrets and confidential information effectively. We require each of our employees and consultants to execute a confidentiality agreement at the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us. However, these agreements may not provide effective protection of our information or, in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure, they may not provide adequate remedies.\nFuture asbestos claims could harm our business.\nWe are subject to potential liabilities relating to certain products we manufactured containing asbestos. We had insurance coverage for asbestos exposures in products prior to November 1, 2003. Since November 1, 2003, insurance coverage for asbestos claims has been unavailable. Our policy coverage for exposures prior to November 1, 2003, declines ratably, by formula, as the number of years increases since coverage expired. Accordingly, we continue to have partial insurance coverage for exposure to asbestos contained in our products prior to November 1, 2003. To date, asbestos claims have not been material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position.\nAs a result of the termination of the NASA Space Shuttle program, manufacturing of rocket engine insulation material containing asbestos ceased in July 2010. In December 2011, we dismantled our facility used to manufacture the asbestos-based insulation for the Space Shuttle program. We have an agreement for indemnification for certain losses we may incur as a result of asbestos claims relating to a product we previously manufactured, but we cannot assure that this indemnification agreement will fully protect us from losses arising from asbestos claims.\nTo the extent we are not insured or indemnified for losses from asbestos claims relating to our products, asbestos claims could adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations may subject us to significant liability.\nOur business and our facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and ordinances governing, among other things, the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and certain waste products. Among these environmental laws are rules by which a current or previous owner or operator of land may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous materials at such property. In addition, these laws typically impose liability regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of any hazardous materials.\nPersons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment site, regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by them.\nBecause we own and operate, and previously owned and operated, a number of facilities that use, manufacture, store, handle or arrange for the disposal of various hazardous materials, we may incur costs for investigation, removal and remediation, as well as capital costs, associated with compliance with environmental laws. At the time of our asset acquisition of the Electronic Warfare Passive Expendables Division of BAE Systems North America (BAE), certain environmental remedial activities were required under a Part B Permit issued to the infrared decoy flare facility by the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The Part B Permit was transferred to our subsidiary, Armtec Defense Products Co., along with the remedial obligations. Under the terms of the asset purchase agreement, BAE agreed to perform and pay for these remedial obligations at the infrared decoy flare facility up to a maximum amount of $25.0 million. BAE is currently conducting monitoring activities as required under the asset purchase agreement.\nAlthough environmental costs have not been material in the past, we cannot assure that these matters, or any similar liabilities that arise in the future, will not exceed our resources, nor can we completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials.\nAn accident at our operations could harm our business.\nWe are subject to potential liabilities in the event of an accident at our facilities, including due to spills or other releases of hazardous substances that are handled in our operating processes or explosion events at our combustible ordnance and flare countermeasure operations. Products in our ordnance and flare operations are highly flammable during certain phases of the manufacturing process. Accordingly, our facilities are designed to isolate these operations from direct contact with employees. Our overall safety infrastructure is compliant with regulatory guidelines. In addition, we utilize hazard detection and intervention systems across our operations. Our employees receive safety training and participate in internal safety demonstrations, and key employee safety statistics are measured and reported as part of the Esterline Operating System. We continuously track safety effectiveness in relation to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, OSHA, and the HSE in the U.K. to help ensure performance is within industry standards. In addition, we perform on-going process safety hazard analyses, which are conducted by trained safety teams to identify risk areas that arise. We monitor progress through review of safety action reports that are produced as part of our operations. Although we believe our safety programs are robust and our compliance with our programs is high, it is possible for an accident to occur. We have had incidents in the past, including accidents at our Arkansas plant in 2014 and 2016 and an accident at our Wallop plant in 2016 and a release of hazardous substances at our Valencia, California, plant in 2018. The accidents in 2016 resulted in three serious injuries and the closure of our Arkansas plant for approximately four months and the accident in 2018 resulted in employees seeking medical treatment and a suspension of activities at the plant during remediation. We are insured in excess of our deductible on losses from property, loss of business, and for personal liability claims from an accident; however, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Significant losses not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with the alleged or actual harm caused by our products.\nWe face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in harm to others or to property. For example, our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that has been designed, manufactured or serviced by us. We may incur significant liability if product liability lawsuits against us are successful. While we believe our current general liability and product liability insurance is adequate to protect us from future product liability claims, we cannot assure that coverage will be adequate to cover all claims that may arise. Additionally, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Significant losses not covered by insurance or for which third-party indemnification is not available could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nImplementing our acquisition strategy involves risks, and our failure to successfully implement this strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOne of our key strategies is to grow our business by selectively pursuing acquisitions. Since 1996 we have completed over 30 acquisitions, and we are continuing to actively pursue additional acquisition opportunities, some of which may be material to our business and financial performance. Although we have been successful with this strategy in the past, we may not be able to grow our business in the future through acquisitions for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nEncountering difficulties identifying and executing acquisitions;\n\u2022\nIncreased competition for targets, which may increase acquisition costs;\n\u2022\nConsolidation in our industry reducing the number of acquisition targets;\n\u2022\nCompetition laws and regulations preventing us from making certain acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nAcquisition financing not being available on acceptable terms or at all.\nIn addition, there are potential risks associated with growing our business through acquisitions, including the failure to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits of an acquisition. For example, with any past or future acquisition, there is the possibility that:\n\u2022\nThe business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture;\n\u2022\nTechnological and product synergies, economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected;\n\u2022\nManagement may be distracted from overseeing existing operations by the need to integrate acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nWe may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities;\n\u2022\nUnforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating operations and systems;\n\u2022\nWe may fail to retain and assimilate employees of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nWe may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases; and\n\u2022\nProblems may arise in entering new markets in which we may have little or no experience and managing the resulting portfolio changes.\nFailure to continue implementing our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 50788, "SIC": 3812, "TIC": "ESL"}
