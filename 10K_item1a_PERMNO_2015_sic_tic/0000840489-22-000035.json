{"cik": "840489", "company": "FirstCash Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nImportant risk factors that could materially affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods are described below. These factors are not intended to be an all-encompassing list of risks and uncertainties and are not the only risks and uncertainties facing the Company. Additional risks not currently known to the Company or that it currently deems to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.\nRisk Factor Summary\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Strategy, Business and Operations\n\u2022The Company faces significant competition from banks, credit unions, internet-based lenders, point-of-sale consumer finance companies, other short-term consumer lenders, governmental entities and other organizations offering similar financial services and retail products to those offered by the Company.\n\u2022A decrease in demand for the Company\u2019s products and services and the failure of the Company to adapt to such decreases could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\n\u2022The Company\u2019s future success is largely dependent upon the ability of its management team to successfully execute its business strategy and drive organic growth.\n\u2022The inability to successfully identify attractive acquisition targets, realize administrative and operational synergies and integrate completed acquisitions could adversely affect results.\n\u2022The Company depends on its senior management and hiring, training and retaining an adequate number of qualified employees to run its businesses.\n\u2022Security breaches, cyber attacks or fraudulent activity could result in damage to the Company\u2019s operations or lead to reputational damage and expose the Company to significant liabilities.\n\u2022The Company\u2019s businesses are typically subject to seasonality, which causes the Company\u2019s revenues and operating cash flows to fluctuate.\n\u2022The Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates in Latin American markets.\n\u2022Changes impacting international trade and corporate tax and other related regulatory provisions may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Regulatory, Legislative and Legal Environment\n\u2022The Company is the subject of a lawsuit initiated by the CFPB alleging violations of the MLA and the Company\u2019s predecessor company\u2019s consent order with the CFPB.\n\u2022The Company\u2019s products and services are subject to extensive regulation and supervision under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations in both the U.S. and Latin America and consumer finance companies that serve credit-constrained consumers, like the Company, face increasing regulatory scrutiny under the current presidential administration and regulatory environment.\n\u2022The adoption of new laws or regulations or adverse changes in, or the interpretation or enforcement of, existing laws or regulations affecting the Company\u2019s products and services could adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.\n\u2022If AFF\u2019s originating bank partner model is successfully challenged or deemed impermissible, it could be found to be in violation of licensing, interest rate limit, lending or brokering laws and face penalties, fines, litigation or regulatory enforcement.\n\u2022Media reports, statements made by regulators and elected officials and public perception in general of pawnshops, LTO and retail finance products for credit-constrained consumers as being predatory or abusive could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s businesses.\n\u2022Current and future litigation or regulatory proceedings, both in the U.S. and Latin America, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022The sale and pawning of firearms, ammunition and certain related accessories is subject to current and potential regulation.\nRisks Related to the AFF Acquisition and Business\n\u2022The Company may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the AFF Acquisition, or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. The Company may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating the AFF business.\n\u2022The AFF business is dependent on merchant partners for its transaction volume and its growth is primarily driven by its ability to attract additional merchants and retain and grow its relationships with its existing merchant partners.\n\u2022The AFF business derives a significant portion of its revenue from several top merchant partners. The loss of business or platform support from one or more of these top merchant partners could have a material adverse effect on the AFF business.\n\u2022The AFF business relies extensively on its proprietary decisioning platform and if such platform is not effective, it could have a material impact on the AFF business and its financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022If the AFF business is unable to collect on its leases, RISAs and bank loans, the performance of its lease and loan portfolio would be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Tax and Financial Matters\n\u2022The Company\u2019s existing and future levels of indebtedness and any potential earnout payments payable in connection with the AFF Acquisition could adversely affect its financial health, its ability to obtain financing in the future, its ability to react to changes in its business and its ability to fulfill its obligations under such indebtedness.\n\u2022Declines in commodity market prices of gold, other precious metals and diamonds could negatively affect the Company\u2019s profits.\n\u2022Unexpected changes in both domestic and foreign tax laws and policies could negatively impact the Company\u2019s operating results.\nRisks Related to Economic and Market Environment\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and may materially and adversely impact in future periods, the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\n\u2022A sustained deterioration of economic conditions or an economic crisis and government actions taken to limit the impact of such an economic crisis could reduce demand or profitability for the Company\u2019s products and services which would result in reduced earnings.\n\u2022The price of the Company\u2019s common stock has fluctuated substantially over the past several months and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future.\nStrategic and Business Risks\nIncreased competition from other pawnshops, point-of-sale consumer finance companies, other short-term consumer lenders, governmental entities and other organizations offering similar financial services and retail products offered by the Company could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s principal competitors are other pawnshops, branch-based consumer loan or finance companies, internet-based lenders, LTO stores, point-of-sale, LTO and consumer finance providers, banks, credit unions and various other types of consumer finance companies that serve the Company\u2019s primarily credit-constrained customer base. In addition, banks and consumer finance companies are developing retail POS payment products and services designed to compete for the credit-constrained customer, many of which have greater financial resources and brand recognition than the Company. Significant increases in the number and size of competitors for the Company\u2019s business could result in a decrease in the number of the Company\u2019s pawn transactions or in AFF\u2019s transaction volumes, resulting in lower levels of revenue and earnings.\nFurthermore, the Company\u2019s retail pawn operations have many competitors, such as retailers of new and pre-owned merchandise, other pawnshops, thrift shops, online retailers of new and pre-owned merchandise, online classified advertising sites, social media platforms and online auction sites. Many consumers view these competitors as a safer, more price competitive or convenient option for acquiring similar products to what the Company sells. AFF also competes with many of these retailers for consumers desiring to purchase lower cost merchandise for cash or on credit.\nIn Mexico, the Company\u2019s pawn stores also compete directly with government sponsored or affiliated non-profit foundations operating pawn stores. The Mexican government could take regulatory or administrative actions that would harm the Company\u2019s ability to compete profitably in the Mexico market.\nIncreased competition or aggressive marketing and pricing practices by these competitors could result in decreased revenue, margins and inventory turnover rates in the Company\u2019s retail operations.\nA decrease in demand for the Company\u2019s products and services and the failure of the Company to adapt to such decreases could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nAlthough the Company actively manages its product and service offerings to ensure that such offerings meet the needs and preferences of its customer base and merchant partners, in the case of the AFF business, the demand for a particular product or service may decrease due to a variety of factors, including many that the Company may not be able to control, anticipate or respond to in a timely manner, such as the availability and pricing of competing products or technology, changes in customers\u2019 financial conditions as a result of changes in unemployment levels, declines in consumer spending habits related to general economic conditions, inflation, public health and safety issues, fuel prices, interest rates, government sponsored economic stimulus programs, social welfare or benefit programs, real or perceived loss of consumer confidence or regulatory restrictions that increase or reduce customer access to particular products. The AFF business also competes in an industry that is subject to significant technological change and disruption and AFF\u2019s ability to meet the needs of both merchants and consumers is dependent on its ability to adequately adapt and respond to these changes.\nThe Company\u2019s retail sales depend in large part on sufficient inventory levels driven primarily by forfeited collateral on pawn loans. If demand for pawn loans decreases, inventory levels typically decline, which can have a material adverse impact on retail sales.\nShould the Company fail to adapt to a significant change in its customers\u2019 demand for, or regular access to, its products, the Company\u2019s revenue could decrease significantly. Even if the Company makes adaptations, its customers or merchants may resist or may reject products or services whose adaptations make them less attractive or less available. In any event, the effect of any product or service change on the results of the Company\u2019s business may not be fully ascertainable until the change has been in effect for some time.\nThe Company\u2019s organic growth is subject to external factors and other circumstances over which it has limited control or that are beyond its control. These factors and circumstances could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to grow.\nThe success of the Company\u2019s organic expansion strategy is subject to numerous external factors, including regulatory restrictions, general economic conditions and acceptance of the Company\u2019s products. With respect to the Company\u2019s pawn business, organic growth is largely driven by the ability to increase the productivity of its existing stores and successfully open new stores, which new store openings are impacted by the availability of sites with favorable customer demographics, limited competition from other pawn stores, community acceptance, suitable lease terms, its ability to attract, train and retain qualified associates and management personnel, the ability to obtain required government permits and licenses and the ability to complete construction and obtain utilities in a timely manner. With respect to the AFF business, organic growth is largely driven by the ability of AFF to expand its network of merchant partners, increase utilization of its products at its merchant partners and improve its technology to support increased growth, meet the needs of its merchants and consumers and make effective approval decisions with respect to its products. Some of these factors are beyond the Company\u2019s control. The failure to execute the Company\u2019s organic expansion strategy would adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to expand its business and could materially adversely affect its business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe inability to successfully identify attractive acquisition targets, realize administrative and operational synergies and integrate completed acquisitions could adversely affect results.\nThe Company has historically grown, in large part, through strategic acquisitions, and the Company\u2019s strategy is to continue to pursue attractive acquisition opportunities if and when they become available. The success of an acquisition is subject to numerous internal and external factors, such as competition rules, the ability to consolidate information technology and accounting functions, the management of additional sales, administrative, operations and management personnel, overall management of a larger organization, competitive market forces, and general economic and regulatory factors. It is possible that the integration process could result in unrealized administrative and operational synergies, the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing businesses, tax costs or inefficiencies, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, information technology systems, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with customers, employees, or other third-parties or the Company\u2019s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions and could harm its financial performance. Furthermore, future acquisitions may be in jurisdictions in which the Company does not currently operate or in lines of business that are new to the Company, which could make the successful consummation and integration of any such acquisitions more difficult. Attractive acquisition targets may also become increasingly scarce in future periods or in jurisdictions the Company would like to expand its operations in. Failure to successfully integrate an acquisition\ncould have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, and failure to successfully identify attractive acquisition targets and complete such acquisitions on favorable terms could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s growth. Additionally, any acquisition has the risk that the Company may not realize a return on the acquisition or the Company\u2019s investment.\nThe Company\u2019s future success is largely dependent upon the ability of its management team to successfully execute its business strategy.\nThe Company\u2019s future success, including its ability to achieve its growth and profitability goals, is dependent on the ability of its management team to execute on its long-term business strategy, which requires them to, among other things: (1) pursue organic growth by opening new pawn stores and expanding AFF\u2019s network of merchant partners, (2) identify attractive acquisition opportunities, close on such acquisitions on favorable terms and successfully integrate acquired businesses, (3) encourage and improve customer traffic at its pawn stores and the utilization of AFF\u2019s products with its existing merchant partners, (4) improve the customer experience at its pawn stores and for AFF\u2019s merchant partners and customers, (5) enhance productivity of its pawn stores, including through investments in technology, (6) control expenses in line with their current projections, (7) keep pace with technological change and improve the Company\u2019s proprietary pawn point-of-sale and loan management system and AFF\u2019s proprietary lease and loan management system and decisioning platform, and (8) effectively maintain its compliance programs and respond to regulatory developments and changes that impact its business. Failure of management to execute its business strategy could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, growth prospects, financial condition or results of operations. Further, if the Company\u2019s growth is not effectively managed, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be negatively affected, and the Company may not be able to continue to implement its business strategy and successfully conduct its operations.\nOperational Risks\nThe Company depends on its senior management and may not be able to retain those employees or recruit additional qualified personnel.\nThe Company depends on its senior management to execute its business strategy and oversee its operations. The Company\u2019s senior management team has significant pawn industry experience in both Latin America and the United States as well as public company experience, which the Company believes is unique in the pawn industry. Furthermore, the addition of AFF\u2019s senior management team following the AFF Acquisition, provides the Company with significant experience with retail POS payment solutions for credit-constrained customers. The loss of services of any of the members of the Company\u2019s senior management could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business until a suitable replacement can be found, if at all. There may be a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and the Company cannot ensure that it would be able to identify or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms. Furthermore, a significant increase in the costs to retain any members of the Company\u2019s senior management could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and operations.\nThe Company depends on hiring, training and retaining an adequate number of qualified employees to run its businesses.\nThe Company\u2019s pawn business relies heavily on retail employees who work on an hourly basis and AFF relies heavily on sales, information technology, data science and customer service employees. The Company must attract, train, and retain a large number of employees, while at the same time controlling labor costs. In particular, the Company\u2019s in-store positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training, retention and other costs and impair the overall customer service and efficiencies at the Company\u2019s pawn stores. There has also been an increase in labor shortages and competition for employees, especially with respect to the Company\u2019s hourly in-store employees, including from retailers and the restaurant industries. The Company also faces meaningful competition for AFF\u2019s salesforce, information technology, call center and data science teams. The lack of availability of adequate employees or the Company\u2019s inability to attract and retain qualified employees, or an increase in wages and benefits to current employees could adversely affect its business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nFurthermore, federal, state or local legislated increases in the minimum wage, as well as increases in additional labor cost components such as employee benefit costs, workers\u2019 compensation insurance rates, compliance costs, fines and, in Mexico, costs associated with labor agreements, unions and profit sharing requirements, would increase the Company\u2019s labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on the uninterrupted operation of the Company\u2019s facilities, systems and business functions, including its information technology and other business systems, and reliance on other companies to provide key components of its business systems.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends highly upon its ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, necessary business functions such as operating, managing and securing its retail locations, technical support centers, security monitoring, treasury and accounting functions and other administrative support functions. Additionally, the Company\u2019s storefront operations depend on the efficiency and reliability of the Company\u2019s proprietary pawn point-of-sale and loan management system and AFF depends on its systems to process its transaction volume and effectively decision and service its customers. Furthermore, third-parties provide a number of key components necessary to the Company\u2019s business functions and systems. Any problems caused by these third-parties could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise conduct its business. A shut-down of or inability to access these systems due to a power outage, a cyber-security breach or attack, a breakdown or failure of one or more of its information technology, telecommunications or other systems, or sustained or repeated disruptions of such systems could significantly impair its ability to perform such functions on a timely basis and could result in a deterioration of the Company\u2019s ability to perform its day-to-day operations, provide customer service or perform other necessary business functions.\nSecurity breaches, cyber attacks or fraudulent activity could result in damage to the Company\u2019s operations or lead to reputational damage and expose the Company to significant liabilities.\nAn important component of the Company\u2019s business involves collection, storage, use, disclosure, processing, transfer and other handling of a wide variety of sensitive, regulated and/or confidential information, including personally identifiable information, for various purposes in its business. The Company has historically maintained minimal personal information with respect to its pawn transactions (primarily name, address and date of birth). However, AFF obtains additional personal information, including social security numbers, dates of birth, bank account and payment card information and data from consumer reporting agencies (including credit report information), increasing the potential risk of unauthorized access to such confidential information. The Company is under constant threat of loss due to the velocity and sophistication of security breaches and cyber attacks. These security incidents and cyber attacks may be in the form of computer hacking, acts of vandalism or theft, malware, computer viruses or other malicious codes, phishing, employee error or malfeasance, catastrophes or unforeseen events or other cyber-attacks. A security breach of the Company\u2019s computer systems, or those of the Company\u2019s third-party service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks, could cause loss of Company assets, interrupt or damage its operations or harm its reputation. In addition, the Company could be subject to liability if confidential customer or employee information is misappropriated from its computer systems. Any compromise of security, including security breaches perpetrated on persons with whom the Company has commercial relationships, that results in the unauthorized access to or use of personal information or the unauthorized access to or use of confidential employee, customer, supplier or Company information, could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, and a loss of confidence of the Company\u2019s customers, vendors and others, which could harm its business and operations. Any compromise of security could deter people from entering into transactions that involve transmitting confidential information to the Company\u2019s systems and could harm relationships with the Company\u2019s suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. Actual or anticipated cyber attacks may cause the Company to incur substantial costs, including costs to prevent future attacks and investigate actual attacks, deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees and engage third-party experts and consultants. Despite the Company\u2019s implementation of significant security measures, including the use of encryption and authentication technology to provide security and authentication to effective secure transmission of confidential information, these systems may still be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third-parties or similar disruptive problems. The Company may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber attacks. Moreover, the Company may be unable to anticipate cyber attacks, react in a timely manner, or implement adequate preventative or remedial measures. Although the Company monitors its systems in order to detect security breaches or instances of unauthorized access to confidential information, there is no guarantee that its monitoring efforts will be effective. While the Company has not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches to date, the Company and AFF have been the subject of attempted hacking and cyber attacks and there can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer significant losses or reputational harm in the future.\nAdditionally, the regulatory environment related to information security and data collection, retention, use and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to the Company\u2019s business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs, such as increased investment in technology or investigative expenses, the costs of compliance with privacy laws, and fines, penalties and costs incurred to prevent or remediate information security or cyber breaches. Furthermore, federal and state regulators and many federal and state laws and regulations require notice of any data security breaches that involve personal information. These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach are\ncostly to implement and often lead to widespread negative publicity, which may cause consumers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s data security measures. Any security breach suffered by the Company or its vendors, any unauthorized, accidental, or unlawful access or loss of data, or the perception that any such event has occurred, could result in a disruption to the Company\u2019s operations, litigation, an obligation to notify regulators and affected individuals, the triggering of indemnification and other contractual obligations, regulatory investigations, government fines and penalties, reputational damage, and loss of customers and ecosystem partners, and its business could be materially and adversely affected.\nLastly, the Company\u2019s cyber and other insurance policies carry retention and coverage limits which may not be adequate to reimburse for losses caused by security breaches, and the Company may not be able to collect fully, if at all, under these insurance policies.\nBecause the Company maintains a significant supply of cash, loan collateral and inventories in its pawn stores and certain processing centers, the Company may be subject to employee and third-party robberies, riots, looting, burglaries and thefts. The Company also may be subject to liability as a result of crimes at its pawn stores.\nThe Company\u2019s business requires it to maintain a significant supply of cash, loan collateral and inventories, including gold and other precious metals, in most of its pawn stores and certain corporate locations. As a result, the Company is subject to the risk of employee and third-party robberies, riots, looting, burglaries and thefts. Although the Company has implemented various programs in an effort to reduce these risks and utilizes various security measures at its facilities, there can be no assurance that robberies, riots, looting, burglaries and thefts will not occur. Robberies, riots, looting, burglaries and thefts could lead to losses and shortages and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. The Company maintains a program of insurance coverage for various types of property, casualty and other risks. However, the insurance program generally has large deductibles and may not be adequate to cover all such losses. The Company could also experience liability or adverse publicity arising from such crimes. Any such event may have a material and adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the Company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights, its ability to compete could be negatively impacted.\nThe success of the Company\u2019s business depends to a certain extent upon the value associated with its intellectual property rights, including its proprietary, internally developed point-of-sale and loan management system that is in use in its pawn stores and its proprietary decisioning technology that is used by the AFF business. The Company relies on a combination of trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary software, website domain names and other rights, including confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual property. While the Company intends to vigorously protect its trademarks and proprietary systems against infringement, it may not be successful. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. The costs required to protect the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights and trademarks could be substantial.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses are typically subject to seasonality, which causes the Company\u2019s revenues and operating cash flows to fluctuate and may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to borrow on its unsecured credit facilities, service its debt obligations and fund its operations.\nThe Company\u2019s U.S. pawn business typically experiences reduced demand in the first and second quarters as a result of its customers\u2019 receipt of federal tax refund checks typically in February of each year while demand typically increases during the third and fourth quarters. The AFF business experiences significantly higher originations in the fourth quarter associated with holiday shopping, which also generally positively impacts retail sales in the Company\u2019s pawn stores in the fourth quarter, and reduced demand in the first and second quarters as retail expenditures are generally lower in these quarters. Typically, the Company\u2019s pawn business experiences seasonal growth of service fees in the third and fourth quarter of each year due to loan balance growth. Service fees generally decline in the first and second quarter of each year due to the typical repayment of pawn loans associated with statutory bonuses received by customers in the fourth quarter in Mexico and with tax refund proceeds typically received by customers in the first quarter in the U.S.\nThis seasonality requires the Company to manage its cash flows over the course of the year. If a governmental authority were to pursue economic stimulus actions or issue additional tax refunds, tax credits or other statutory payments at other times during the year, such actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition during these periods. If the Company\u2019s revenues were to fall substantially below what it would normally expect during certain periods, the Company\u2019s annual financial results, its ability to borrow on its unsecured credit facilities, and its ability to service its debt obligations or fund its operations, including originations for the AFF business, could be adversely affected.\nThe failure or inability of third-parties who provide products, services or support to the Company to maintain their products, services or support could disrupt Company operations or result in a loss of revenue.\nThe Company\u2019s operations and cash management are dependent upon the Company\u2019s ability to maintain retail banking services, treasury management services and borrowing relationships with commercial banks. Actions by federal regulators in the U.S. and other Latin American countries where the Company operates have caused many commercial banks, including certain banks used by the Company, to cease offering such services to the Company and other businesses in the pawn, LTO and consumer finance industries. The Company also relies significantly on outside vendors to provide services related to financial transaction processing (including credit and debit card processors), utilities, store security, armored transport, precious metal smelting, data and voice networks and other information technology products and services. The failure or inability of any of these third-party financial institutions or vendors to provide such services could limit the Company\u2019s ability to grow its business and could increase the Company\u2019s costs of doing business, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations if the Company is unable to timely replace them with comparable service providers at a comparable cost.\nRegulators and payment processors are scrutinizing certain consumer finance companies\u2019 access to the Automated Clearing House (\u201cACH\u201d) system to disburse and collect proceeds and repayments for consumer finance products, and any interruption or limitation on the Company\u2019s ability to access this critical system would materially adversely affect its business.\nIt has been reported that actions, referred to as Operation Choke Point, by the U.S. Department of Justice (the \u201cJustice Department\u201d) the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the \u201cFDIC\u201d) and certain state regulators appear to be intended to discourage banks and ACH payment processors from providing access to the ACH system for certain lenders that they believe are operating illegally, cutting off their access to the ACH system to either debit or credit customer accounts (or both).\nIn the past, this heightened regulatory scrutiny by the Justice Department, the FDIC and other regulators has caused some banks and ACH payment processors to cease doing business with consumer finance companies who are operating legally, without regard to whether those companies are complying with applicable laws, simply to avoid the risk of heightened scrutiny or even litigation. These actions have reduced the number of banks and payment processors who provide ACH payment processing services and could conceivably make it increasingly difficult to find banking partners and payment processors in the future and/or lead to significantly increased costs for these services. Furthermore, the Company also relies on credit card companies and payment processors for a significant portion of its retail sales as well as payments on its pawn loans, LTO, RISA and bank loan products. These companies may decide to cease doing business with the Company due to regulatory or reputational concerns. If the Company is unable to maintain access to needed services on favorable terms, the Company would have to materially alter, or possibly discontinue, some or all of its business if alternative processors are not available.\nRegulatory, Legislative and Legal Risks\nThe Company is the subject of a lawsuit initiated by the CFPB alleging violations of the MLA and the Company\u2019s predecessor company\u2019s 2013 CFPB consent order and a purported securities class action.\nOn November 12, 2021, the CFPB initiated a civil action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas against FirstCash, Inc. and Cash America West, Inc., two of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries, alleging violations of the MLA. The CFPB also alleges that FirstCash, Inc. violated a 2013 CFPB order against its predecessor company that, among other things, required the predecessor company to cease and desist from further MLA violations. The CFPB is seeking an injunction, redress for affected borrowers and a civil money penalty. While the Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations in the case, it cannot predict or determine the timing or final outcome of this matter, or the effect that any adverse determinations from the lawsuit may have on the Company. An unfavorable determination in the lawsuit could result in the payment of substantial monetary damages, which could have a material effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition. The Company may also be required to modify its business practices in the event of an unfavorable determination in the lawsuit, which could impact demand for its products and customer satisfaction. Further, the legal costs associated with the lawsuit, which may not be covered by insurance, and the amount of time required to be spent by management and the Board of Directors on this matter, even if the Company is ultimately successful, could have a material effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, due to the impact of the announcement of the CFPB\u2019s action on the Company\u2019s stock price, the Company has become subject to a purported securities class action related to the CFPB\u2019s lawsuit and may become subject to further related litigation. An unfavorable result in these matters could also have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are subject to extensive regulation and supervision under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations in both the U.S. and Latin America. If changes in regulations affecting the Company\u2019s pawn business or the AFF business create increased restrictions, or have the effect of prohibiting pawn loans or POS payment products in the jurisdictions where the Company currently operates, such regulations could materially impair or reduce the Company\u2019s business and limit its expansion into new markets.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are subject to extensive regulation and supervision under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations in both the U.S. and Latin America. Federal and state regulatory authorities are increasingly focused on consumer finance and retail POS payment products for credit-constrained consumers such as those offered by the Company. The Company faces the risk that restrictions or limitations on pawn loans and retail POS payment products resulting from the enactment, change, interpretation or enforcement of laws and regulations in the U.S. or Latin America could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s business activities. In addition, certain consumer advocacy groups, federal, state and local legislators and governmental agencies have also asserted that rules, laws and regulations should be tightened so as to severely limit, if not eliminate, the availability of pawn transactions, POS payment products and buy/sell agreements to consumers. Moreover, the Company expects the current presidential administration to devote substantial attention to consumer protection matters, including more aggressive enforcement actions, and, as a result, businesses transacting with credit-constrained consumers could be held to higher standards of monitoring, disclosure and reporting, regardless of whether new laws or regulations governing the Company\u2019s industry are adopted. It is difficult to assess the likelihood of the enactment of any unfavorable federal or state legislation or local ordinances, and there can be no assurance that additional legislative, administrative or regulatory initiatives will not be enacted that would severely restrict, prohibit, or eliminate the Company\u2019s ability to offer certain products and services.\nIn particular, with respect to the Company\u2019s pawn business, restrictions and regulations such as licensing requirements for pawn stores and their employees, customer identification requirements, suspicious activity reporting, disclosure requirements and limits on interest rates, loan service fees, or other fees have been and continue to be proposed. Adoption of such federal, state or local regulation or legislation in the U.S. and Latin America could restrict, or even eliminate, the availability of pawn transactions and buy/sell agreements at some or all of the Company\u2019s locations, which would adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, certain aspects of the AFF business, such as the content of its advertising and other disclosures to customers about transactions, its collection practices, the manner in which AFF contacts its customers, the decisioning process regarding whether to enter into a transaction with a potential customer, its credit reporting practices and the manner in which it processes and stores certain customer, employee and other information are subject to federal and state laws and regulatory oversight. These applicable state and federal privacy laws will require AFF to design, implement and maintain different types of privacy- and access-related compliance controls and programs simultaneously in multiple states, thereby further increasing the complexity and cost of compliance.\nMoreover, certain states limit the total amount or rate of finance charge that AFF may charge a customer in order for the customer to achieve ownership of the leased merchandise at the end of the lease term. Additional states may elect to implement similar limits or states with existing limits may elect to further lower the total cost that AFF may charge a customer to achieve ownership of the leased merchandise at the end of the lease term, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operation and financial condition.\nThe complexity of the political and regulatory environment in which the Company operates and the related cost of compliance are both increasing due to the changing political landscape, additional legal and regulatory requirements, the Company\u2019s ongoing expansion into new markets and the fact that foreign laws occasionally are vague or conflict with domestic laws. In addition to potential damage to the Company\u2019s reputation and brand, failure to comply with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations such as those outlined elsewhere in these risk factors may result in the Company being subject to claims, lawsuits, fines and adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe FTC and the CFPB have regulatory, supervisory and enforcement powers over providers of consumer financial products and services in the U.S., and each could exercise its enforcement powers in ways that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results.\nThe FTC is charged with preventing unfair or deceptive acts or practices and false or misleading advertisements, and the CFPB is charged with preventing unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices. To this end, the FTC and CFPB have been exercising their supervisory and investigative powers over certain non-bank providers of consumer financial products and services. In particular, both the FTC and CFPB have the authority to issue civil investigative demands and pursue administrative proceedings or litigation for actual or perceived violations of some federal consumer laws. In these proceedings, the FTC can seek consent orders, confidential memorandums of understandings, cease and desist orders (which can include orders for redisclosure, restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as affirmative or injunctive relief) and monetary penalties. The CFPB\u2019s examination authority permits its examiners to inspect the books and records of providers of short-term, small dollar loans and ask questions about their business practices. As a result of these examinations of non-bank providers of consumer credit, the Company could be subject to specific enforcement action, including monetary penalties, which could adversely affect the Company.\nAlso, where a company is alleged to have violated Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act or CFPB regulations implemented under Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state attorneys general and certain state regulators to bring civil actions to remedy alleged violations of law. If the CFPB or one or more state attorneys general or state regulators believe that the Company has violated any of the applicable laws or regulations or any consent orders or confidential memorandums of understanding against or with the Company, they could exercise their enforcement powers in ways that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results. Furthermore, under the current presidential administration, the CFPB has been more aggressive in their exercise of the enforcement powers making it more likely, as evidenced by the CFPB\u2019s action against the Company related to alleged violations of the MLA, that future enforcement actions will be brought against consumer finance companies providing services and products to credit-constrained customers.\nSee \u201cItem 1. Business-Government Regulation\u201d for a further discussion of the regulatory authority of the CFPB.\nThe FDIC has issued examination guidance affecting AFF\u2019s unaffiliated third-party lender and these or subsequent new rules and regulations could have a significant impact on AFF\u2019s products originated by the Bank.\nThe installment loans are originated by the Bank using technology and marketing services provided by AFF. The Bank is supervised and examined by both the state of Utah, which charters the Bank, and the FDIC. If the FDIC or the Utah Department of Financial Institutions considers any aspect of the products originated by the Bank to be inconsistent with its guidance, the Bank may be required to alter or discontinue the product.\nOn July 29, 2016, the board of directors of the FDIC released examination guidance relating to third-party lending, which, if finalized, would apply to all FDIC-supervised institutions that engage in third-party lending programs, including certain bank products. The proposed guidance elaborates on previously-issued agency guidance on managing third-party risks and specifically addresses third-party lending arrangements where an FDIC-supervised institution relies on a third party to perform a significant aspect of the lending process. The types of relationships that would be covered by the guidance include (but are not limited to) relationships for originating loans on behalf of, through or jointly with third-parties, or using platforms developed by third parties. If adopted as proposed, the guidance would result in increased supervisory attention of institutions that engage in significant lending activities through third-parties, including at least one examination every 12 months, as well as supervisory expectations for a third-party lending risk management program and third-party lending policies that contain certain minimum requirements, such as self-imposed limits as a percentage of total capital for each third-party lending relationship and for the overall loan program, relative to origination volumes, credit exposures (including pipeline risk), growth, loan types, and acceptable credit quality. While the guidance has never formally been adopted, it is the Company\u2019s understanding that the FDIC has relied upon it in its examination of third-party lending arrangements.\nIf AFF\u2019s originating bank partner model is successfully challenged or deemed impermissible, it could be found to be in violation of licensing, interest rate limit, lending or brokering laws and face penalties, fines, litigation or regulatory enforcement.\nLoans originated through the Bank\u2019s program would have accounted for 5% of the Company\u2019s total revenues during 2021 on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the AFF Acquisition as if it had closed on January 1, 2021. AFF relies on its originating bank partner model to comply with various federal, state and other laws. If the legal structure underlying AFF\u2019s relationship with the Bank was successfully challenged, it may be found to be in violation of state licensing requirements and state laws regulating interest rates. For example, AFF is currently responding to a subpoena from the New Jersey Attorney General related to its partner bank\u2019s loan product, and in the state of New Mexico there is pending legislation which would effectively prohibit AFF\u2019s use of the bank partner model in that state. Such bank loan products in New Jersey and New Mexico would have accounted for less than 1% of the Company\u2019s total revenues during 2021 on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the AFF Acquisition as if it had closed on January 1, 2021. In the event of such a challenge or if its arrangements with the Bank were to end for any reason, AFF would need to find and rely on an alternative bank relationship, rely on existing state licenses, obtain new state licenses, pursue a federal bank charter, offer consumer loans and/or be subject to the interest rate limitations of certain states.\nAFF could be subject to litigation, whether private or governmental, or administrative action regarding the above claims. The potential consequences of an adverse determination could include the inability to collect loans at the interest rates contracted for, licensing violations, the loans being found to be unenforceable or void, or the reduction of interest or principal, or other penalties or damages. Third-party purchasers of loans facilitated through AFF\u2019s platform also may be subject to scrutiny or similar litigation, whether based upon the inability to rely upon the \u201cvalid when made\u201d doctrine or because a party other than the Bank is deemed the true lender.\nThe adoption of new laws or regulations or adverse changes in, or the interpretation or enforcement of, existing laws or regulations affecting the Company\u2019s products and services could adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.\nGovernments, including agencies at the national, state and local levels, may seek to enforce or impose new laws, regulatory restrictions, licensing requirements or taxes that affect the Company\u2019s products or services it offers, the terms on which it may offer them, and the disclosure, compliance and reporting obligations it must fulfill in connection with its business. They may also interpret or enforce existing requirements in new ways that could restrict the Company\u2019s ability to continue its current methods of operation or to expand operations, impose significant additional compliance costs, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, these measures could even directly prohibit some or all of the Company\u2019s current business activities in certain jurisdictions, or render them unprofitable and/or impractical to continue.\nMedia reports, statements made by regulators and elected officials and public perception in general of pawnshops, LTO and retail finance products for credit-constrained consumers as being predatory or abusive could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s businesses. In recent years, consumer advocacy groups and some media reports, in both the U.S. and Latin America, have advocated governmental action to prohibit or place severe restrictions on the Company\u2019s products and services.\nReports and statements made by consumer advocacy groups, members of the media, regulators and elected officials often focus on the annual or monthly cost to a consumer of pawn, LTO and certain retail finance transactions, which are higher than the interest typically charged by banks to consumers with better credit histories. These reports and statements typically characterize these products as predatory or abusive and often focus on alleged instances of pawn operators purchasing or accepting stolen property as pawn collateral. If the negative characterization of the Company\u2019s businesses becomes increasingly accepted by consumers, demand for its products could significantly decrease, which could materially affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, if the negative characterization of these types of transactions becomes increasingly accepted by legislators and regulators, the Company could become subject to more restrictive laws and regulations that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, any negative public perception of pawnshops generally would also likely have a material negative impact on the Company\u2019s retail operations, including reducing the number of consumers willing to shop at the Company\u2019s stores.\nJudicial or administrative decisions, CFPB rule-making, amendments to the Federal Arbitration Act (the \u201cFAA\u201d) or new legislation could render the arbitration agreements the Company uses illegal or unenforceable.\nThe Company includes dispute arbitration provisions for its employees and in its pawn, LTO and retail finance agreements. These provisions are designed to allow the Company to resolve any employee or customer disputes through individual arbitration rather than in court. The Company\u2019s arbitration provisions explicitly provide that all arbitrations will be conducted on an individual and not on a class or collective basis. Thus, the Company\u2019s arbitration agreements, if enforced, have the effect of mitigating class and collective action liability.\nHowever, a number of state and federal circuit courts and the National Labor Relations Board have concluded that arbitration agreements with consumer class action waivers are \u201cunconscionable\u201d and hence unenforceable, particularly where a small dollar amount is in controversy on an individual basis.\nTherefore, it is possible that the Company\u2019s consumer arbitration agreements will be rendered unenforceable. Additionally, Congress has considered legislation that would generally limit or prohibit mandatory dispute arbitration in certain consumer contracts, and it has adopted such prohibitions with respect to certain mortgage loans and certain consumer loans to active-duty members of the military and their dependents.\nAny judicial or administrative decision, federal legislation or agency rule that would impair the Company\u2019s ability to enter into and enforce consumer arbitration agreements with class action waivers, could significantly increase the Company\u2019s exposure to class action litigation as well as litigation in plaintiff friendly jurisdictions. Such litigation could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCurrent and future litigation or regulatory proceedings, both in the U.S. and Latin America, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company or its subsidiaries has been, is, or may become involved in lawsuits, regulatory or administrative proceedings, examinations, investigations, consent orders, memorandums of understanding, audits, other actions arising in the ordinary course of business, including those related to consumer financial protection, federal or state wage and hour laws, product liability, unclaimed property, employment, personal injury and other matters that could cause it to incur substantial expenditures and generate adverse publicity. In particular, the Company may be involved in lawsuits or regulatory actions related to consumer finance and protection, employment, marketing, unclaimed property, competition matters, and other matters, including class action lawsuits brought against it for alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, state wage and hour laws, state or federal advertising laws, consumer protection, lending and other laws. The consequences of defending proceedings or an adverse ruling in any current or future litigation, judicial or administrative proceeding, including consent orders or memorandums of understanding, could cause the Company to incur substantial legal fees, to have to refund fees and/or interest collected, refund the principal amount of advances, pay treble or other multiple damages, pay monetary penalties, fines, and/or modify or terminate the Company\u2019s operations in particular states or countries. Defense or filing of any lawsuit or administrative proceeding, even if successful, could require substantial time, resources, and attention of the Company\u2019s management and could require the expenditure of significant amounts for legal fees and other related costs. Settlement of lawsuits or administrative proceedings may also result in significant payments and modifications to the Company\u2019s operations. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, administrative proceedings and other claims, the Company cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such matters.\nAdverse court and administrative interpretations or enforcement of the various laws and regulations under which the Company operates could require the Company to alter the products that it offers or cease doing business in the jurisdiction where the court, state or federal agency interpretation and enforcement is applicable. The Company is also subject to regulatory proceedings, and the Company could suffer losses from interpretations and enforcement of state or federal laws in those regulatory proceedings, even if it is not a party to those proceedings. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition and could impair the Company\u2019s ability to continue current operations.\nThe sale and pawning of firearms, ammunition and certain related accessories is subject to current and potential regulation, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s reputation, business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause the Company accepts firearms as pawn collateral and buys and sells firearms, ammunition and certain related accessories in many U.S. locations, the Company is required to comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to the pawning, purchase, storage, transfer and sale of such products, and the Company is subject to reputational harm if a customer purchases or pawns a firearm that is later used in a deadly shooting.\nOver the past several years, the purchase, sale and ownership of firearms, ammunition and certain related accessories has been the subject of increased media scrutiny and federal, state and local regulation. If enacted, new laws and regulations could limit the types of licenses, firearms, ammunition and certain related accessories that the Company is permitted to purchase and sell and could impose new restrictions and requirements on the manner in which the Company pawns, offers, purchases and sells these products, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurthermore, the Company may incur losses and reputational damage due to lawsuits relating to its performance of background checks on firearms purchases as mandated by state and federal law, the selling of firearms or the improper use of firearms sold by the Company, including lawsuits by individuals, municipalities, state or federal agencies or other organizations attempting to recover damages or costs from firearms retailers relating to the sale or misuse of firearms. Furthermore, if any firearms sold by the Company are used in the commitment of any crimes or mass shootings, it could result in significant adverse media attention against the Company and have a material adverse impact on the reputation of the Company. Commencement of such lawsuits or any adverse media attention against the Company could have a material adverse effect on its business, reputation, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to the FCPA, anti-money laundering laws and other anti-corruption laws, and the Company\u2019s failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties that could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their agents or intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and/or other benefits. The Company is also subject to anti-money laundering laws in both the United States and Latin America and anti-terrorism financing laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act and the Patriot Act. Furthermore, AFF is required under its agreements with its originating bank partner to maintain an enterprise-wide program designed to enable it to comply with all applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act and the Patriot Act. Although the Company has policies and procedures designed to ensure that it, its employees, agents, and intermediaries comply with the FCPA, anti-money laundering laws and other similar laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect the Company against liability for actions taken by its employees, agents, and intermediaries with respect to its business or any businesses that it may acquire. In the event the Company believes, or has reason to believe, its employees, agents, or intermediaries have or may have violated applicable anti-corruption laws in the jurisdiction in which it operates, including the FCPA, the Company may be required to investigate or have a third-party investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management. The Company\u2019s continued operation and expansion outside the U.S., especially in Latin America, could increase the risk, perceived or otherwise, of such violations in the future.\nIf the Company is found to have violated the FCPA, anti-money laundering laws or other similar laws, the Company may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could have an adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition, and relationship with regulators and the Bank. Investigation of any potential or perceived violations of the FCPA, anti-money laundering laws or other similar laws by U.S. or foreign authorities could harm the Company\u2019s reputation and could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to maintain certain criteria required by state and local regulatory bodies could result in fines or the loss of the Company\u2019s licenses to conduct business.\nMost states and many local jurisdictions both in the U.S. and in Latin America in which the Company operates require registration and licenses of stores and employees to conduct the Company\u2019s business. These states or their respective regulatory bodies have established criteria the Company must meet in order to obtain, maintain, and renew those licenses. In addition, the AFF business is also subject to certain states\u2019 laws which regulate and require licensing, registration, notice filing or other approval by parties that engage in certain activity regarding consumer finance transactions, including facilitating and assisting\nsuch transactions in certain circumstances. Furthermore, certain states and localities have also adopted laws requiring licensing, registration, notice filing, or other approval for consumer debt collection or servicing, and/or purchasing or selling consumer loans. From time to time, the Company is subject to audits in various states to ensure it is meeting the applicable requirements to maintain the applicable licenses and registrations.\nFailure to meet the Company\u2019s legal compliance requirements could result in substantial fines and penalties, store closures, the temporary or permanent suspension of operations, the revocation of existing licenses and/or the denial of new and renewal licensing requests. The Company cannot guarantee future license applications or renewals will be granted. If the Company were to lose any of its licenses to conduct its business, it could result in the temporary or permanent closure of stores and/or cessation of AFF\u2019s consumer lending activities, any of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and cash flows.\nForeign Operations Risks\nThe Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates in Latin American markets.\nThe Company derives significant revenue, earnings and cash flow from operations in Latin America, where business operations are transacted in Mexican pesos, Guatemalan quetzales and Colombian pesos. The Company\u2019s exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements, as well as from transaction exposure associated with transactions and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the respective subsidiaries\u2019 functional currencies. While the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of the Company\u2019s Latin American subsidiaries are prepared using their respective functional currency and translated into U.S. dollars by applying appropriate exchange rates. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar relative to the Latin American currencies could cause significant fluctuations in the value of the Company\u2019s assets, liabilities, stockholders\u2019 equity and operating results. In addition, while expenses with respect to foreign operations are generally denominated in the same currency as corresponding sales, the Company has transaction exposure to the extent expenditures are incurred in currencies other than the respective subsidiaries\u2019 functional currencies. The costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions also may increase as a result of adverse currency rate fluctuations. In addition, changes in currency rates could negatively affect customer demand, especially in Latin America and in U.S. stores located near the Mexican border. For a detailed discussion of the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates, see \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d\nRisks and uncertainties related to the Company\u2019s foreign operations could negatively impact the Company\u2019s operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had 1,744 store locations in Latin America, including 1,656 in Mexico, 60 in Guatemala, 15 in Colombia and 13 in El Salvador, and the Company plans to open additional stores in Latin America in the future. In addition, AFF owns a customer service call center operating in Jamaica and utilizes third-party call center services located in the Dominican Republic and Mexico. Doing business in each of these countries involves increased risks related to geo-political events, political instability, corruption, economic volatility, property crime, drug cartel and gang-related violence, social and ethnic unrest including riots and looting, enforcement of property rights, governmental regulations, tax policies, banking policies or restrictions, foreign investment policies, public safety, health and security, anti-money laundering regulations, interest rate regulation and import/export regulations among others. As in many developing markets, there are also uncertainties as to how both local law and U.S. federal law is applied, including areas involving commercial transactions and foreign investment. As a result, actions or events could occur in these foreign countries that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, which could restrict or eliminate the Company\u2019s ability to operate some or all of its locations in these countries or significantly reduce customer traffic, product demand and the expected profitability of such operations.\nChanges impacting international trade and corporate tax and other related regulatory provisions may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of the foreign countries in which the Company operates impose costs on non-domestic companies through the use of local regulations, tariffs, labor controls and other federal or state requirements or legislation. As the Company derives significant revenue, earnings and cash flow from operations in Latin America, primarily in Mexico, there are some inherent risks regarding the overall stability of the trading relationship between Mexico and the U.S. and the burdens imposed thereon by any changes to (or the adoption of new) regulations, tariffs or other federal or state legislation. Specifically, the Company has significant exposure to fluctuations and devaluations of the Mexican peso and the health of the Mexican economy, which, in each case, may be negatively impacted by changes in U.S. trade treaties, including the United States-Mexico-Canada\nAgreement and corporate tax policy. In some cases, there have been negative reactions to the enacted and/or proposed policies as expressed in the media and by politicians in Mexico, which could potentially negatively impact U.S. companies operating in Mexico. In particular, there is continued uncertainty around Mexico\u2019s current federal administration and how the policies as applied by its administration, including conducting aggressive corporate tax and other regulatory audits, adverse government discretion, and support of increased employee minimum wages, profit sharing and benefit programs, may impact U.S. companies doing business in Mexico generally and pawn and consumer finance companies in particular. While the Company engages in limited cross-border transactions other than those involving scrap jewelry sales, any such changes in regulations, trade treaties, corporate tax policy, import taxes or adverse court or administrative interpretations of the foregoing could adversely and significantly affect the Mexican economy and ultimately the Mexican peso, which could adversely and significantly affect the Company\u2019s financial position and results of the Company\u2019s Latin America pawn operations.\nRisks Related to the AFF Acquisition\nThe Company may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the AFF Acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. The Company may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating the AFF business.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the AFF Acquisition depends, to a large extent, on its ability to integrate the AFF business, which is a complex, costly and time-consuming process, and for the AFF business to achieve its projected growth rates. AFF also represents a new line of business for the Company, which increases the complexity and challenges of the integration process as compared to the Company\u2019s pawn acquisitions. As a result of the AFF Acquisition, the Company must devote significant management attention and resources to integrate the business practices and operations of the Company and AFF. The integration process may disrupt the Company\u2019s business and, if implemented ineffectively, could restrict the realization of the full expected benefits. The failure to meet the challenges involved in the integration process and to realize the anticipated benefits of the AFF Acquisition could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the Company\u2019s operations and could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the integration of the AFF business may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customers and other business relationships, and diversion of management\u2019s attention. Additional integration challenges include:\n\u2022difficulties in integrating and managing a new line of business with different products, including those with credit risk, retail merchant partners and additional regulatory risks;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention to integration matters;\n\u2022difficulties in achieving anticipated synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from the AFF Acquisition;\n\u2022difficulties in the integration of operations and systems;\n\u2022difficulties in conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies, business cultures and compensation structures;\n\u2022difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company;\n\u2022challenges in keeping existing merchant partners and obtaining new merchant partners;\n\u2022challenges in retaining and assimilating key personnel;\n\u2022the impact of potential liabilities the Company may be inheriting from AFF;\n\u2022difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate culture and management philosophies; and\n\u2022a potential deterioration of the Company\u2019s credit ratings.\nMany of these factors are outside of the Company\u2019s control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations and result in the Company becoming subject to litigation. In addition, even if the AFF business is integrated successfully, the full anticipated benefits of the AFF Acquisition may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are anticipated. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process. All of these factors could cause reductions in the Company\u2019s earnings per share, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the AFF Acquisition and negatively impact the price of shares of its common stock. As a result, it cannot be assured that the AFF Acquisition will result in the realization of the full anticipated benefits.\nThe AFF Acquisition may not be accretive and may cause dilution of the Company\u2019s adjusted earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company anticipates that the AFF Acquisition will be accretive to stockholders on an adjusted earnings per share basis. This expectation is based on currently available net revenue and operating expense estimates, which may materially change. The Company could also encounter additional transaction and integration-related costs or other factors such as the failure to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the AFF Acquisition. All of these factors could cause dilution of the Company\u2019s adjusted earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the AFF Acquisition and cause a decrease in the market value of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nFailure to retain key employees could diminish the anticipated benefits of the AFF Acquisition.\nThe success of the AFF Acquisition will depend in large part upon the ability of the Company to retain personnel critical to the AFF business. Employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles or apprehension about joining a larger and public company. The corporate cultures may also differ, and some Company or AFF employees may choose not to remain with the Company. If the Company is unable to retain Company or AFF personnel that are critical to the Company\u2019s operations, the Company could experience disrupted operations, loss of customers, key information, expertise and know how, or unanticipated hiring and training costs, especially given that the Company\u2019s existing management team has limited experience operating a line of business similar to the AFF business. In addition, the loss of key personnel could diminish the anticipated benefits of the AFF Acquisition that are actually achieved by the Company.\nThe Company may be required to make earnout payments to the AFF sellers if certain conditions are met, including if the AFF business achieves earnout thresholds and if the Company\u2019s stock price does not reach certain levels and, as a result, the Company\u2019s financial position may be adversely impacted if it is required to make such payments.\nIn connection with the AFF Acquisition, the Company may be required to make earnout payments in the form of cash and/or shares of the Company\u2019s common stock to the sellers of the AFF business as described below:\n\u2022The sellers of the AFF business are entitled to receive up to an additional $300.0 million of consideration pursuant to an earnout if the AFF business achieves certain adjusted EBITDA targets following the closing of the AFF Acquisition (the \u201cEarnout Consideration\u201d). In particular, the earnout provides the seller parties the right to receive up to $250.0 million of additional consideration if the AFF business achieves certain adjusted EBITDA targets for the period consisting of the fourth quarter of 2021 through the end of 2022 and up to $50.0 million if the AFF business achieves certain adjusted EBITDA targets for the first half of 2023. The Earnout Consideration is payable in cash or, at the Company\u2019s discretion and subject to obtaining any required stockholder approvals under the NASDAQ rules for such issuance, in shares of the Company\u2019s common stock.\n\u2022The sellers of the AFF business are entitled to received up to $75.0 million of additional consideration in the event that the highest average stock price of the shares of the Company\u2019s common stock being issued to the seller parties pursuant to that certain Business Combination Agreement, by and among the Company, AFF and the other parties thereto, dated October 27, 2021 (the \u201cAcquisition Agreement\u201d), for any 10-day period from the date of that certain Amendment to the Acquisition Agreement, dated as of December 6, 2021 (the \u201cAmendment\u201d), through February 28, 2023 (the \u201cHighest Average Stock Price\u201d) is less than $86.25 (the \u201cReference Price\u201d). In the event that the Highest Average Stock Price is less than the Reference Price, then the AFF sellers shall be entitled to an amount equal to such difference multiplied by the number of shares issued to the AFF sellers as stock consideration (approximately 8.05 million shares), with such amount capped at $75.0 million.\n\u2022In addition, the Amendment provided for a fixed $25.0 million working capital payment payable at the end of 2022.\nIf any of these earnout thresholds or stock price conditions are met, the Company may not have sufficient cash reserves to pay the cash amount due to the AFF sellers. If the Company is able to pay these cash amounts, the payment may impede its ability to fund other aspects of its business, which would adversely affect its operating results and the price of its common stock and senior unsecured notes.\nAdditional Risks Related to the AFF Business\nIf AFF is unable to attract additional merchants and retain and grow its relationships with its existing merchant partners, its business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\nAFF\u2019s continued success is dependent on its ability to maintain and expand its merchant partner base and the volume of transactions from these merchants in order to grow revenue on its platform. Its ability to retain and grow its relationships with its merchant partners depends on the willingness of merchants to partner with AFF. The attractiveness of AFF\u2019s platform to merchants depends upon, among other things, the size of its consumer base, its brand and reputation, the amount of merchant premium, discounts or profit share paid or received by AFF, its ability to sustain its value proposition to merchants for customer acquisition by demonstrating higher conversion at checkout, the attractiveness to merchants of AFF\u2019s technology and data-driven platform, services and products offered by competitors, and its ability to perform under, and maintain, its merchant agreements. It\u2019s also important that AFF partner with merchants with growing sales across a diverse mix of retail channels to mitigate risk associated with changing consumer spending behavior, economic conditions and other factors that may affect a particular type of merchant or industry. Additionally, AFF\u2019s agreements with its merchant partners are generally terminable for convenience.\nIf AFF is not able to retain its existing merchant partners, attract additional merchants and expand revenue and volume of transactions from existing merchants, it will not be able to continue to grow its business and its business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\nAFF derives a significant portion of its revenue from several top merchant partners. The loss of business from one or more of these top merchant partners could have a material adverse effect on the AFF business.\nHistorically, AFF has relied on a limited number of merchant partners for a significant portion of its total revenues and transaction volume. On a pro forma basis after giving effect to the AFF Acquisition as if it had closed on January 1, 2021, AFF\u2019s top five merchant partners accounted for an aggregate of 16% of combined pro forma 2021 revenues and future revenues and transaction volume of AFF may be similarly concentrated. The loss of any of these top merchant partners or groups of merchant partners for any reason, or a change of relationship with any of AFF\u2019s key merchant partners could adversely affect the results of operations of the AFF business.\nAdditionally, mergers or consolidations among AFF\u2019s top merchant partners could reduce the number of merchant partners and could adversely affect AFF\u2019s revenues. In particular, if AFF\u2019s merchant partners are acquired by entities that are not also AFF\u2019s merchant partners, that do not use its solutions or that have more favorable contract terms with a competitor and choose to discontinue, reduce or change the terms of their use of AFF\u2019s solutions, the AFF business and its operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nAFF\u2019s transaction volume is dependent on the support of its platform by its merchant partners.\nAFF depends on its merchants to drive transaction volume by supporting its platform over alternative payment options for credit-constrained customers and prominently presenting AFF\u2019s platform as an attractive payment option for these customers. The degree to which these merchants successfully integrate the AFF platform into their website or in their store, such as by prominently featuring its platform on their websites or in their stores, has a material impact on AFF\u2019s transaction volume. The failure by AFF\u2019s merchants to effectively present, integrate, and support its platform would have a material and adverse effect on AFF\u2019s originations and, as a result, on its business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects.\nFurthermore, AFF relies on these merchants to comply with all applicable laws and regulations associated with the LTO, RISA and bank loan products offered by AFF. As part of this process, merchants are generally contractually required to comply with AFF\u2019s policies, procedures, marketing materials, and training materials. In the event that a merchant or merchant employee fails to adequately and correctly describe the terms and conditions of the lease, RISA or bank loan product, the merchant and/or AFF may be subject to consumer complaints and/or lawsuits.\nAFF\u2019s bank loan product is offered pursuant to its agreement with the Bank and such agreement is non-exclusive, short-term in duration and subject to termination by the Bank partner upon the occurrence of certain events. If that agreement is terminated and AFF is unable to either replace the commitments of the Bank or substitute its other products for the bank loan product, its business, results of operations, financial condition, and future prospects may be materially affected.\nAFF serves as a marketer, service provider and sub-servicer of loans originated by a Utah chartered state bank. Under this arrangement, AFF purchases a portion of the cash flows originated by the Bank and sub-services the loans thereafter. AFF does not originate or ultimately control the pricing or functionality of the loans. The Bank makes all key decisions regarding the marketing, underwriting, product features and pricing. AFF generates revenues through the loans and through marketing and sub-servicing fees paid by the Bank. If the Bank were to change its pricing, underwriting or marketing of the loans in a way that decreases revenues or increases losses, then the profitability of each loan could be reduced. Loans originated through the Bank\u2019s program represent a material amount of AFF\u2019s total origination volume. AFF\u2019s bank loan product relies on the Bank originating the loans that are facilitated through AFF\u2019s platform and complying with various federal, state and other laws. The loan program agreement has an initial term that expires during the third quarter of 2023, which automatically renews once for an additional three year term unless either party provides notice of non-renewal prior to the end of any such term. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain early termination events, either AFF or the Bank may terminate the loan program agreement immediately upon written notice to the other party. The Bank could decide not to work with AFF for any reason, could make working with AFF cost-prohibitive or could decide to enter into an exclusive or more favorable relationship with one or more of AFF\u2019s competitors. If the Bank were to suspend, limit or cease its operations, or if AFF\u2019s relationship with the Bank were to otherwise terminate for any reason (including, but not limited to, its failure to comply with regulatory actions), AFF would need to implement a substantially similar arrangement with another bank, obtain additional state licenses or curtail its offering of a direct to consumer loan product through its platform. If AFF needs to enter into alternative arrangements with a different bank to replace its existing arrangements, it may not be able to negotiate a comparable alternative arrangement in a timely manner or at all. If AFF is unable to enter into an alternative arrangement with different banks to fully replace or supplement its relationship with the Bank, AFF would potentially need to cease offering its bank loan product or other direct to consumer installment loans. In the event that AFF\u2019s relationship with the Bank were terminated and it is unable to substitute another one of its products at the merchants that utilize such bank loan products, its business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects may be materially affected.\nAFF\u2019s transaction volume is dependent on sales at its merchant partners and any decline in such sales or interruptions, inventory shortages and other factors affecting the supply chains of AFF\u2019s merchant partners could have a material and adverse effect on AFF\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and future prospects.\nAFF depends on sales at its merchant partners to drive its transaction volume. If AFF\u2019s merchant partners experience a general decline in sales it could negatively impact AFF\u2019s transaction volume. Any extended supply chain interruptions, inventory shortages or other operational disruptions affecting any of its merchant partners could have a material adverse impact on AFF\u2019s transaction volume and results of operations. AFF depends on its merchant partners\u2019 abilities to deliver products to customers at the right time and in the right quantities. Accordingly, it is important for these merchant partners to maintain optimal levels of inventory and respond rapidly to shifting demands. The disruption to, or inefficiency in, supply chain networks may have an adverse impact on AFF\u2019s operations in the near term, but if such interruptions were to continue, could potentially have a more material adverse impact on its results of operations, financial condition and future prospects.\nAFF\u2019s business relies extensively on its proprietary decisioning platform and if such platform is not effective it could have a material impact on AFF\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAFF\u2019s business is largely predicated on the effectiveness of its proprietary decisioning platform and model and AFF relies extensively on this platform for LTO, RISA and bank loan decisioning. AFF\u2019s platform relies heavily on AFF\u2019s modeling and analytics as well as information provided by applicants and third-party data providers and credit reporting agencies. To the extent that applicants provide inaccurate or unverifiable information or data from third-party providers is incomplete or inaccurate, then AFF\u2019s platform will not be able to perform effectively, which could result in wrong or sub-optimal decisions with respect to applicants. AFF\u2019s data providers could also stop providing data, provide untimely, incorrect or incomplete data, or increase the costs for their data for a variety of reasons, including security or regulatory concerns or for competitive reasons. If AFF were to lose access to this external data or if such access is restricted or becomes more expensive, it could have a material effect on AFF\u2019s business. Furthermore, the models underlying AFF\u2019s decisioning platform may prove in practice to be less predictive than AFF expects for a variety of reasons, including as a result of errors in constructing, interpreting or using the models or the use of inaccurate assumptions (including failures to update assumptions appropriately or in a timely manner). The potential errors or inaccuracies in AFF\u2019s decisioning platform and models may be material and effect a significant number of transactions, which could have a material and adverse effect on AFF\u2019s business.\nIf AFF is unable to collect on its leases, RISAs and bank loans, the performance of its lease and loan portfolio would be adversely affected.\nAFF\u2019s ability to collect scheduled payments under its leases, RISAs and bank loans is dependent on its customers\u2019 continuing financial stability, and consequently, collections can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, inflationary impacts and individual factors such as job loss, divorce, death, illness, personal bankruptcy and customer fraud. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and debtor relief laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on AFF\u2019s leases, RISAs and bank loans. Federal, state or other restrictions could impair the ability of AFF or the third-party collection services utilized by AFF to collect amounts owed and due on the leases and loans facilitated through its platform. Furthermore, AFF relies on its proprietary decisioning platform to decision its LTO, RISA and bank loan products and customizes this technology to individual merchants and merchandise categories. There is no guarantee that this technology or platform will be effective in making decisions that minimize credit losses. Furthermore, the platform relies on an experienced data science team. In the event the platform is not effective or cannot be supported at the required levels, AFF could experience increased credit losses.\nIf AFF is unable to fully collect on its leases, RISAs and bank loans, the performance of its lease and loan portfolio will be adversely affected, which could result in additional provisions for lease and loan losses and loss of revenue, cash flow and profitability.\nAccounting, Tax and Financial Risks\nThe Company\u2019s existing and future levels of indebtedness and any potential earnout payments payable in connection with the AFF Acquisition could adversely affect its financial health, its ability to obtain financing in the future, its ability to react to changes in its business and its ability to fulfill its obligations under such indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2021, including the Company's senior unsecured notes and the Company\u2019s unsecured credit facilities, the Company had outstanding principal indebtedness of $1,309.0 million and availability of $267.0 million under its unsecured credit facilities, subject to certain financial covenants. The Company's level of indebtedness and amounts owed pursuant to potential earnout payments resulting from the AFF Acquisition could:\n\u2022make it more difficult for it to satisfy its obligations with respect to the Company\u2019s senior unsecured notes and its other indebtedness, resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of such indebtedness;\n\u2022require it to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flows to fund originations in the AFF business, working capital, acquisitions, new store openings, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limit its ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, financing originations from the AFF business, acquisitions, new store openings, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limit its ability to refinance indebtedness or cause the associated costs of such refinancing to increase;\n\u2022restrict the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer assets to the Company, which could limit its ability to, among other things, make required payments on its debt;\n\u2022increase the Company\u2019s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including interest rate fluctuations (because a portion of its borrowings are at variable rates of interest); and\n\u2022place the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to other companies with proportionately less debt or comparable debt at more favorable interest rates who, as a result, may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns.\nAny of the foregoing impacts of the Company\u2019s level of indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, the Company has, in the past, accessed the debt capital markets to refinance existing debt obligations and to obtain capital to finance growth. However, the Company\u2019s future access to the debt capital markets could become restricted due to a variety of factors, including a deterioration of the Company\u2019s performance or financial condition, overall industry prospects or changes in debt capital markets or the economy generally. Inability to access the credit markets on acceptable terms, if at all, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and ability to fund future growth.\nAdditionally, the Company\u2019s debt instruments include certain affirmative and negative covenants that require the Company to comply with certain financial covenants and impose restrictions on the Company\u2019s financial and business operations, including limitations on liens, indebtedness, fundamental changes, asset dispositions, dividends and other similar restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, payments and modifications of certain existing debt, future negative pledges, and changes in the\nnature of the Company\u2019s business. A failure to comply with the covenants contained in the Company\u2019s debt instruments could result in an event of default or an acceleration of debt under its debt instruments. In addition, the Company\u2019s debt instruments contain cross-default provisions that could result in its debt being declared immediately due and payable under a number of debt instruments, even if the Company defaults on only one debt instrument. In such event, it is possible that the Company would not be able to satisfy its obligations under all of such accelerated indebtedness simultaneously.\nDetermining the AFF business\u2019 allowance for lease and loan losses requires many assumptions and complex analyses. If the estimates prove incorrect, the AFF business may incur net charge-offs in excess of its reserves, or may be required to increase its provision for lease and loan losses, either of which would adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to measure and report its financial position and results of operations is influenced by the need to estimate the impact or outcome of future events on the basis of information available at the time of the issuance of the financial statements. An accounting estimate is considered critical if it requires that management make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made. If actual results differ from the judgments and assumptions, then it may have an adverse impact on the results of operations and cash flows. Management has processes in place to monitor these judgments and assumptions, but these processes may not ensure that the judgments and assumptions are correct.\nThe Company maintains an allowance for lease and loan losses at a level sufficient to cover estimated lifetime losses expected to be incurred in the lease and loan portfolio. This estimate is highly dependent upon the reasonableness of its assumptions and the predictability of the relationships that drive the results of its valuation methodologies. The Company performs a quantitative analysis to compute historical losses to estimate the allowance for lease and loan losses. Lease and loan loss experience, first payment default histories, contractual delinquency of lease and loan receivables and management\u2019s judgement are factors used in assessing the overall adequacy of the allowance and the resulting provision for lease and loan losses. Changes in estimates and assumptions can significantly affect the allowance and provision for lease and loan losses. It is possible that the Company will experience lease and loan losses that are different from its current estimates. If the Company\u2019s estimates and assumptions prove incorrect and its allowance for lease and loan losses are insufficient, it may incur net charge-offs in excess of its reserves, or it could be required to increase its provision for lease and loan losses, either of which would adversely affect its results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to goodwill impairment risk.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company had $1,536.2 million of goodwill on its consolidated balance sheet, all of which represents assets capitalized in connection with the Company\u2019s acquisitions and business combinations. Accounting for goodwill requires significant management estimates and judgment. Management performs periodic reviews of the carrying value of goodwill to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that an impairment in value may have occurred. A variety of factors could cause the carrying value of goodwill to become impaired. A write-down of the carrying value of goodwill could result in a non-cash charge, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nDeclines in commodity market prices of gold, other precious metals and diamonds could negatively affect the Company\u2019s profits.\nThe Company\u2019s profitability could be adversely impacted by commodity market fluctuations. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 57% of the Company\u2019s pawn loans were collateralized with jewelry, which is primarily gold, and 49% of its inventories consisted of jewelry, which is also primarily gold. The Company sells significant quantities of gold, other precious metals and diamonds acquired through collateral forfeitures or direct purchases from customers. A significant and sustained decline in gold and/or other precious metal and diamond prices could result in decreased merchandise sales and related margins, decreased inventory valuations and sub-standard collateralization of outstanding pawn loans. In addition, a significant decline in market prices could result in a lower balance of pawn loans outstanding for the Company, as customers would receive lower loan amounts for individual pieces of jewelry or other gold items. For a detailed discussion of the impact of a decline in market prices on wholesale scrap jewelry sales, see \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d\nUnexpected changes in both domestic and foreign tax laws and policies could negatively impact the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s financial results may be negatively impacted by changes in domestic or foreign tax laws, administrative interpretations of such laws and enforcement of policies, including, but not limited to, an increase in statutory tax rates, changes in allowable expense deductions, or the imposition of new withholding requirements on repatriation of foreign earnings.\nThe application of indirect taxes, such as sales tax, is a complex and evolving issue, particularly with respect to the LTO industry generally and AFF\u2019s virtual and e-commerce LTO businesses more specifically. Failure to comply with such tax provisions or a successful assertion by a jurisdiction requiring AFF to collect taxes in a location or for transactions where AFF presently does not, could result in substantial tax liabilities, including for past sales and leases, as well as penalties and interest. In addition, if the tax authorities in jurisdictions where AFF is already subject to sales tax or other indirect tax obligations were to successfully challenge AFF\u2019s positions, AFF\u2019s tax liability could increase substantially.\nGeneral Economic and Market Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and will likely continue to adversely impact, the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to adversely affect consumer traffic and demand for pawn loans and AFF\u2019s retail finance products and has, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations. The extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact the Company\u2019s operations, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration and severity of the outbreak (including the possibility of further surges or variants of concern of the virus), the efficacy of the vaccination programs in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, supply chain disruptions, rising inflation and labor costs, its ability to maintain sufficient qualified personnel due to labor shortages, employee illness, quarantine, willingness to return to work, vaccine and/or testing mandates, face-coverings and other safety requirements, or travel and other restrictions, and the actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals to contain the impact of COVID-19, as well as further actions taken to limit the resulting economic impact. These factors may adversely impact consumer, business, and government spending as well as customer demand for pawn loans and the Company\u2019s retail finance products on an ongoing basis, each of which could adversely impact its business and operations.\nWhile the Company saw positive results in the second half of 2021 despite the challenges raised by the COVID-19 environment, there remains uncertainty regarding how COVID-19 and general economic conditions will impact the Company\u2019s business and operations in future periods. Nevertheless, COVID-19 continues to present a material uncertainty which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in the future.\nA sustained deterioration of economic conditions or an economic crisis and government actions taken to limit the impact of such an economic crisis could reduce demand or profitability for the Company\u2019s products and services which would result in reduced earnings.\nThe Company\u2019s business and financial results may be adversely impacted by sustained unfavorable economic conditions or unfavorable economic conditions associated with a global or regional economic crisis which, in either case, include unemployment, declining personal income and consumer sentiment, inflation, adverse changes in interest or tax rates, effects of government initiatives to manage economic conditions and increased volatility of commodity markets and foreign currency exchange rates. Specifically, a sustained or rapid deterioration in the economy, along with the potential enactment of government stimulus programs to attempt to limit such economic deterioration, could adversely impact the performance of the Company\u2019s pawn loan and AFF\u2019s lease and loan portfolio and consumer or market demand for discretionary consumer goods and services weakening demand for AFF\u2019s products and also demand for pre-owned merchandise or gold sold in the Company\u2019s pawnshops. A sustained deterioration in the economy could also reduce the demand and resale value of pre-owned merchandise and reduce the amount that the Company could effectively lend on an item of collateral. Such reductions could adversely affect pawn loan balances, pawn redemption rates, inventory balances, inventory mixes, sales volumes and gross profit margins.\nFurthermore, economic conditions and demand may also fluctuate by geographic region. The current geographic concentration of the Company\u2019s pawn stores and AFF\u2019s merchant partners creates exposure to local economies and politics, and regional downturns. As a result, the Company\u2019s business is currently more susceptible to regional conditions than the operations of more geographically diversified specialty finance companies, and the Company is vulnerable to economic downturns or changing political landscapes in those regions. Any unforeseen events or circumstances that negatively affect these areas could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and profitability.\nThe price of the Company\u2019s common stock has fluctuated substantially over the past several months and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price has been, and may continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations, and has decreased significantly in recent months from historical trading levels as a result of a variety of factors, including the announcement of the acquisition of AFF, the CFPB\u2019s action against the Company and other factors, some of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. The Company may fail to meet the expectations of its stockholders or securities analysts at some point in the future, and its stock price could decline further as a result. This volatility may prevent investors from being able to sell their common stock at or above the price they paid for their common stock.\nIn addition, the stock markets in general have experienced volatility recently that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. Due to the impact of the announcement of the CFPB\u2019s action on the Company\u2019s stock price, the Company has become subject to a purported securities class action related to the CFPB\u2019s lawsuit and may become subject to further litigation. An unfavorable result in these matters could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nInclement weather, natural disasters or health epidemics can adversely impact the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe occurrence of weather events and natural disasters such as rain, cold weather, snow, wind, storms, hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or health epidemics in the Company\u2019s markets could adversely affect consumer traffic, retail sales, pawn loan and pawn redemption activities and LTO, RISA and installment loan originations and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations. In addition, the Company may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by insurance. Losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and may increase the Company\u2019s expenses, which could harm the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nAdverse real estate market fluctuations and/or the inability to renew and extend store operating leases could affect the Company\u2019s profits.\nThe Company leases most of its pawn store locations. Many of the store leases, especially in Latin America, include annual rent escalations tied to the local consumer price index. A significant rise in real estate prices or real property taxes could also result in an increase in store lease costs as the Company opens new locations and renews leases for existing locations, thereby negatively impacting the Company\u2019s results of operations. The Company also owns certain developed and undeveloped real estate, which could be impacted by adverse market fluctuations. In addition, the inability of the Company to renew, extend or replace expiring store leases could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nA discussion of certain other market risks is covered in \u201cItem 7A.
