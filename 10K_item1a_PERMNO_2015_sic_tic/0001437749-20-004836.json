{"cik": "1158895", "company": "LEMAITRE VASCULAR INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following information about the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public filings in evaluating our business. The following important factors, among others, could cause our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or presented elsewhere by management from time to time. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not material may also significantly impair our business operations. Our business could be harmed by any of these risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and investors may lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf we do not comply with foreign regulatory requirements to market our products outside the United States, our business will be harmed.\nSales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary from country to country. These requirements and the amount of time required for approval may differ from our experiences with the FDA in the United States. In some cases, we rely on our international distributors to obtain premarket approvals, complete product registrations, comply with clinical trial requirements, and complete those steps that are customarily taken in the applicable jurisdictions to comply with governmental and quasi-governmental regulation. In the future, we expect to continue to rely on distributors in this manner in those countries where we continue to market and sell our products through them. Failure to satisfy these foreign regulations would impact our ability to sell our products in these countries and could cause our business to suffer. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain the required regulatory approvals in these countries.\nOur products are regulated in the European Union (EU) under the European Medical Devices Directive (93/42/EC as amended by 2007/47/EC) (MDD). In order to market our medical devices in the EU, we are required to obtain CE mark certifications, which denote conformity to the essential requirements of the MDD, and manufacturers of higher-risk devices generally must use a \u201cNotified Body\u201d-an appointed independent third party to assess conformity. We have received CE mark certifications to sell nearly all of our products, though currently there is a lapse in our CE mark certifications for some of our products due to one of our Notified Bodies abandoning all services related to the MDD. On June 13, 2019, the Notified Body that issued the majority of our CE mark certifications, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance or LRQA, notified its clients that it would cease providing all Notified Body services relating to the MDD to all clients, including us, as of September 12, 2019, which date was subsequently extended to September 30, 2019. As a result, all LRQA-issued CE mark certifications, unless earlier transferred to a new Notified Body, would lapse as of such date. Prior to receipt of such notice, we had begun transitioning our CE mark certifications to a new Notified Body, TUV SUD. However, TUV SUD was unable to complete all work necessary to reissue our CE mark certifications by September 30, 2019. Under the MDD, only product placed on the European market at our European subsidiary prior to September 30, 2019 is eligible for sale to EU countries. As a result, prior to September 30, 2019, we manufactured and shipped inventory in amounts that for most products we believe would be sufficient to supply our EU customers while we await reissuance of the CE mark certifications by TUV SUD. CE mark certifications were reissued in February 2020 for many of our products. For some products for which CE marks have not yet been reissued, we expect to continue selling product from our inventory reserves already placed on the market in the EU prior to September 30, 2019. However, we do not expect reissuance of our CE mark certifications 1) for XenoSure or AlboGraft until Q2 2020, 2) for Anastoclip AC closure systems, Anastoclip GC closure systems, Flexcel carotid shunts and LifeSpan ePTFE vascular grafts until Q4 2020 and 3) for AlboSure vascular patches until Q4 2021. We have started to experience backorders related to the inventory of such products held by our European subsidiary. If the reissuance of our CE marks for any of our products is materially delayed or withheld, our revenues could be further impacted due to our saleable inventory reserves becoming depleted and our business could be harmed.\nAdditionally, the CE mark for our Omniflow II graft will lapse due to the delays in the ability of our Notified Body for this product, TUV Rheinland, to review our manufacturing site change application from North Melbourne, Australia to Burlington, Massachusetts. This delay will also subject Omniflow II to an MDR application process earlier than we expected. This will result in a lapse in the CE mark certification for Omniflow II from June 2020 until we receive the CE mark certification of Omniflow II, which we expect to occur by Q3 2021. We expect that the inventory of the majority of such products held by our European subsidiary will only be sufficient to supply our customers until Q3 2021, based on historical sales, and as a result, we may go into backorder for such products until the CE mark is issued. If the CE mark certification for Omniflow II is materially delayed or withheld, our European revenues could be impacted due to our saleable inventory reserves becoming depleted and our business could be harmed.\nIn April 2017, the EU adopted new regulations for medical devices (MDR), which replace the MDD and apply after a three year transition period. Our products will be subject to the MDR, which require all of our products, regardless of classification, to obtain a new CE mark in accordance with the new, more stringent standards under the MDR. As a condition to CE mark approval, clinical evidence from clinical investigations will be required for Class III and implantable devices. As our Notified Bodies start to transition from MDD to MDR, they have begun to impose more rigorous requirements on us in order to obtain approval to renew the CE marks on certain of our products. For example, we have been informed by BSI, our Notified Body for the product lines manufactured in our Saint-Etienne, France facility, that they require more clinical data for three of the four product lines for the continuance of the CE mark certifications and the upcoming MDR certifications for such devices. If we fail to obtain sufficient clinical data for these products, our current CE marks may be suspended or not issued in a timely manner or at all, and future sales of those products could be adversely impacted. Additionally, if we fail to obtain new CE marks on these products or our other products under the MDR in a timely manner, or at all, future sales of our products in the EU could be adversely impacted.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain CE marks for our existing products, and obtaining CE marks may involve a significant amount of time and expense, stringent clinical and preclinical testing, or modification of our products and could result in limitations being placed on the use of our products in order to obtain approval. If we fail to obtain new CE marks on our products in a timely manner, or at all, future sales of our products could be adversely impacted.\nMaintaining a CE mark is contingent upon our continued compliance with applicable European medical device requirements, including limitations on advertising and promotion of medical devices and requirements governing the handling of adverse events. As illuminated above, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining the CE mark for any of our current products. In particular, adverse event reporting requirements in the EU mandate that we report incidents which led or could have led to death or serious deterioration in health. Under certain circumstances, we could be required to or could voluntarily initiate a recall or removal of our product from the market in order to address product deficiencies or malfunctions. Any recall of our products may harm our reputation with customers and divert managerial and financial resources.\nFailure to receive or maintain approval would prohibit us from selling these products in member countries of the EU, and would require significant delays in obtaining individual country approvals. If we do not receive or maintain these approvals, our business could be harmed.\nOur facilities are subject to periodic inspection by numerous regulatory authorities, including governmental agencies and Notified Bodies, and we must demonstrate compliance with their applicable medical devices regulations. Our most recent inspections were as follows:\nFacility\nAgency\nJurisdiction\nDate\nBurlington\nU.S. FDA\nUnited States\nAugust 2017\nVaughan\nHealth Canada\nCanada\nAugust 2017\nNorth Melbourne\nTherapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)\nAustralia\nSeptember 2017\nNorth Melbourne\nBrazil (ANVISA)\nBrazil\nOctober 2017\nFox River Grove\nAATB\nWorldwide\nJanuary 2018\nFox River Grove\nU.S. FDA\nUnited States\nJanuary 2018\nBurlington\nNotified Body (LRQA)\nEurope\nJanuary 2018\nNorth Melbourne\nNotified Body (TUV Rheinland)\nEurope\nJanuary 2018\nShanghai\nChina FDA (NMPA)\nChina\nAugust 2018\nBurlington\nNotified Body (LRQA)\nUnited States Medical\nDevice Single Audit Program\nOctober 2018\nBurlington\nNotified Body (LRQA)\nEurope\nNovember 2018\nNorth Melbourne\nNotified Body (TUV Rheinland)\nEurope\nNovember 2018\nNorth Melbourne\nTherapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)\nAustralia\nDecember 2018\nBurlington\nNotified Body (LRQA)\nEurope\nDecember 2018\nBurlington\nKorean FDA\nKorea\nJanuary 2019\nSaint-Etienne\nNotified Body (BSI)\nEurope\nJanuary 2019\nTokyo\nNotified Body (JET)\nJapan\nFebruary 2019\nBurlington\nTherapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)\nAustralia\nMarch 2019\nSaint-Etienne\nNotified Body (BSI)\nEurope\nMarch 2019\nBurlington\nNotified Body (LRQA)\nUnited States Medical Device Single Audit Program\nMarch 2019\nNorth Melbourne\nNotified Body (TUV Rheinland)\nEurope\nJune 2019\nSaint-Etienne\nNotified Body (BSI)\nEurope\nOctober 2019\nAny failure by us to comply with regulatory requirements in this regard may entail our taking corrective action, such as modification of our policies and procedures. In addition, we may be required to cease all or part of our operations for some period of time until we can demonstrate that appropriate steps have been taken. There can be no assurance that we will be found in compliance with such standards in future audits.\nWe also pursue registrations in other jurisdictions in which we sell our devices directly, such as Japan and China. In 2015, the China Food and Drug Administration (NMPA) significantly increased the application fees for product registrations and imposed additional requirements for obtaining product approval, which includes requirements for conducting clinical trials to support the registration application process on newly introduced products in China. As a result, we may not seek registration for certain products where the cost is not justified. Any delay in product registrations could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results.\nFluctuations in our quarterly and annual financial results have resulted and will continue to result from numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in demand for the products and services we sell;\n\u2022\nthe acceleration or deceleration of growth rates of our products, particularly in the case of biologic vascular patches whose growth rate has declined over recent periods;\n\u2022\nincreased product and price competition, due to market conditions, the regulatory landscape or other factors;\n\u2022\nchanges in the mix of products and services we sell;\n\u2022\nour pricing strategy with respect to different product lines and services;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us, such as acquisitions of businesses, products, or technologies;\n\u2022\neffects of domestic and foreign economic conditions and exchange rates on our industry and/or customers;\n\u2022\nthe divestiture or discontinuation of a product line or other revenue generating activity;\n\u2022\nthe relocation and integration of manufacturing or processing operations and other strategic restructuring;\n\u2022\nregulatory actions that may necessitate recalls of our products or warning letters that negatively affect the markets for our products;\n\u2022\nchanges to the regulatory status of our products, including suspension or cancellation of licenses or CE marking;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign political relations that add additional barriers to entry;\n\u2022\nour determination whether or not to continue the payment of quarterly cash dividends, and/or the amount and frequency at which to increase them;\n\u2022\ncosts incurred by us in connection with the termination of contractual and other relationships, including those of distributors or agents;\n\u2022\nour ability to collect outstanding accounts receivable in selected countries outside of the United States;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business;\n\u2022\nthe expiration, elimination or utilization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carry-forwards;\n\u2022\nmarket reception of our new or improved product and service offerings; and\n\u2022\nthe loss of any significant customer, especially in regard to any product or service that has a limited customer base.\nThese factors, some of which are not within our control, may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. If our quarterly operating results fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could drop suddenly and significantly. We believe the quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not always meaningful and should not be relied upon as the sole indicator of our future performance.\nIf we are unable to expand our product and service offerings, we may not achieve our growth objectives and our results of operations could suffer.\nThe treatment of peripheral vascular and cardiovascular disease includes both open vascular surgery and minimally invasive endovascular procedures, and many of our products are used primarily or exclusively in open surgery procedures. We market and sell our products primarily to vascular surgeons, and the majority of our marketing efforts and sales relate to products used in open vascular surgery rather than in endovascular procedures. We estimate that in 2019, over 90% of our net sales were from devices used primarily in open surgery.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors unless we can keep pace with existing or new products, services and technologies in the vascular device market and the minimally invasive endovascular procedure segment, in particular. Our success in developing and commercializing new products and new versions of our existing products and services is affected by our ability to:\n\u2022\nrecognize in a timely manner new market trends and customer needs;\n\u2022\nidentify products or services that address those trends or needs;\n\u2022\nobtain regulatory clearance or approval of new products and technologies;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully develop cost-effective manufacturing processes for such products;\n\u2022\ncommercially introduce such products, services and technologies; and\n\u2022\nachieve market acceptance.\nIf we are unable to expand our product or service offerings, we may not achieve our growth objectives and our results of operations as well as our stock price could suffer.\nWe may not maintain our recent levels of profitability.\nThere can be no assurance we will continue to achieve net sales growth and/or profit growth in the future. If, for example, we are unable to effectively manage our operating expenses due to, for example, additional CE mark expenses, or increased headcount, we may need to reduce our operating expenses through cost-cutting in order to maintain or improve operating profitability. Decreased investment levels may inhibit future growth in net sales and earnings.\nAdditionally, our ability to maintain and increase profitability will be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe level and timing of future sales, manufacturing costs and operating expenses;\n\u2022\nour ability to restrain or reduce operating expenses through cost-cutting measures;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our new products and services;\n\u2022\nthe productivity of our direct sales force and distributors;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully build direct sales organizations in new markets;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully acquire and develop competitive products;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses, products, services or technologies;\n\u2022\nthe impact on our business of competing products, technologies, and procedures;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for our products in new and existing markets;\n\u2022\nthe reimbursement rates for the medical procedures in which our products are used;\n\u2022\nthe cost of litigation, if any; and\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws.\nWe may acquire businesses and assets in the future. We may experience difficulties in completing the integration of these acquisitions into our business, or we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions.\nIn order to expand our product offerings, we have completed 23 acquisitions, and a key part of our strategy is to acquire additional businesses, products, or technologies in the future. Our growth strategy depends, in part, upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete, and integrate suitable acquisitions. If we are unable to complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms or at all, our growth objectives and sales could be negatively affected.\nEven if we complete acquisitions, we may experience:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating any acquired businesses, personnel, and products into our existing business;\n\u2022\ndifficulties or delays in integrating manufacturing operations into our existing business or successfully replicating manufacturing processes at new manufacturing facilities on a cost-effective basis;\n\u2022\ndegradation in our corporate gross margin due to lower margins associated with our acquired devices;\n\u2022\nthe sudden reduction in volume or loss of orders from a key customer, particularly where the acquired company had concentrated sales;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our management\u2019s time and attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nhigher costs of integration than we anticipated;\n\u2022\nunknown or unanticipated liabilities included as part of the acquisition;\n\u2022\ndisputes or litigation with former owners related to contingent payments, liabilities assumed or not assumed or other matters;\n\u2022\nchallenges in complying with new regulatory requirements to which we were not previously subject;\n\u2022\nincreased regulatory scrutiny;\n\u2022\nchallenges in maintaining or obtaining regulatory approvals for acquired products;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired business who are necessary to manage these acquisitions;\n\u2022\ndifficulties if the acquired company is remote or inconvenient to our Burlington, Massachusetts, headquarters, such as the operations we acquired in 2014 in North Melbourne, Australia and in 2018 in Saint-Etienne, France;\n\u2022\ndifficulties or delays in transitioning clinical studies or unfavorable results from such clinical studies;\n\u2022\nloss of key suppliers or issues with the ongoing supply of the acquired product from its former owners;\n\u2022\ncharges related to the acquisition of in-process research and development;\n\u2022\ndilution as a result of equity financing required to fund acquisition costs; or\n\u2022\ndebt, as a result of debt financing required to fund acquisitions, which would be senior to our common stock, would require interest payments to a lender, and could restrict our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nWe could also discover deficiencies withheld from us due to fraud or otherwise not uncovered in our due diligence prior to an acquisition, including but not limited to deficiencies in internal controls, data adequacy and integrity, product quality, and regulatory compliance, as well as undisclosed contractual or other liabilities and product liabilities, any of which could result in us becoming subject to penalties or other liabilities. Any of these difficulties could negatively impact our ability to realize the intended and anticipated benefits that we currently expect from our acquisitions or from acquisitions we complete in the future, and could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also acquired the processing, preservation and distribution operations of RestoreFlow allografts located in Fox Rover Grove, Illinois. See \u201cOur tissue processing and preservation services are subject to a variety of risks, including those related to the procurement of human tissue and regulatory requirements\u201d below for risks associated with our tissue processing and preservation services.\nFor any of these reasons or as a result of other factors, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions and our operating results may be harmed.\nOur call point focus on the vascular surgeon with a product portfolio largely used in open surgical procedures may be too narrow, which may adversely affect our future sales.\nThe treatment of peripheral vascular disease continues to shift from open vascular surgery to minimally invasive endovascular procedures. We market and sell our products primarily to vascular surgeons, and the majority of our marketing efforts and sales relate to products used in open vascular surgery rather than in endovascular procedures. We estimate that in 2019, over 90% of our net sales were from devices used in open vascular procedures.\nIn addition to performing traditional open surgical procedures, vascular surgeons in growing numbers also perform minimally invasive, image-guided interventional procedures for peripheral vascular disease. However, vascular surgeons may not adopt these procedures in the numbers we expect and instead these procedures may be largely performed by interventional cardiologists and interventional radiologists. Many of our competitors have focused their sales efforts on these interventionalists. If interventional cardiologists and interventional radiologists perform a greater percentage of these new procedures than we expect, our net sales may decline.\nMoreover, demographic trends and other factors, such as reimbursement rates, are also driving vascular surgeons in the United States and potentially in other markets to increasingly specialize in certain kinds of procedures, such as the creation and maintenance of dialysis access sites and endovascular therapies. Vascular surgeon training programs may focus on those therapies to the exclusion of open vascular procedures. If there is a decline in vascular surgeons training in open vascular procedures in favor of training in minimally invasive endovascular procedures, this could limit the number of vascular surgeons using our products due to lack skills in open vascular procedures. Further, even those physicians trained in open procedures may discontinue performing them if there is a lack of demand. If this trend continues, it could lead to the fragmentation of our customer base, which would reduce cross-selling opportunities and the efficiency of each sales call by our sales representatives, which in turn could negatively impact our business.\nCardioCel is sold to a different call point from that of most of our product lines, and we may not be successful in selling to that call point.\nHistorically, the majority of sales of CardioCel have been to pediatric cardiac surgeons, a call point that is different from our main call point focus. We market and sell our products primarily to vascular surgeons, and the majority of our marketing efforts and sales relate to products used in open vascular surgery. As a result, our sales representatives make sales calls predominantly to vascular surgeons and to a lesser extent, cardiac and neuro surgeons. Our success in selling CardioCel will depend, in part, on our sales representatives devoting a portion of their time to making sales calls to, and establishing relationships with, pediatric cardiac surgeons. If they do not undertake these activities or are unsuccessful in doing so, then this could lead to the loss of sales and customers of CardioCel, and our financial condition or results of operations could be harmed. Most of our product lines are used in vascular procedures and as a result, our sales representatives can cross-sell a significant portion of our product portfolio to vascular surgeons. Cross-selling opportunities to pediatric cardiac surgeons will be limited. Additionally, if our sales representatives spend less time focused on sales of our other product lines to vascular surgeons, the sales of those products could decrease, and our financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.\nOur tissue processing and preservation services are subject to a variety of risks, including those related to the procurement of human tissue and regulatory requirements.\nIn November 2016, we acquired the processing, preservation and distribution operations for the RestoreFlow allograft. Prior to the acquisition, we did not provide any human tissue services. Our ability to successfully provide such services may be affected by the following:\n\u2022\nmaintenance of quality standards and controls to mitigate the risk that processed tissue cannot be sterilized;\n\u2022\ncompliance with regulatory and legal requirements specific to human tissue, with which we were previously unfamiliar, or changes in those requirements;\n\u2022\nmaintenance of our AATB accreditation, FDA establishment registration and state licensures;\n\u2022\nthe degree to which our tissue procurement organizations are successful in procuring the gift of tissue donation;\n\u2022\nprocurement from tissue procurement organizations of adequate amounts of human tissue of a type and quality that meets our specifications, particularly as we may compete for these tissues with organizations who may have greater resources than us;\n\u2022\nprocessing human tissue in a cost effective manner;\n\u2022\ncontrolling turnover in a workforce skilled in tissue processing and cryopreservation and any subsequent delay necessary for the adequate training of new personnel; and\n\u2022\ncompliance of our tissue procurement organizations to current good tissue practices and our own procurement procedures.\nOur failure in any one or more of these areas could adversely impact our ability to provide processing, preservation and distribution services related to allografts and therefore our operations.\nOur dependence on sole- and limited-source suppliers could hinder our ability to deliver our products and services to our customers on a timely basis or at all and could harm our results of operations.\nWe rely on sole- and limited-source suppliers for some of our important product components and certain products. For example, our TRIVEX system and associated disposables, as well as components of our EndoRE remote endarterectomy product line, are manufactured for us by third-party suppliers. Additionally, we rely on a sole-source supplier for the ovine material used for our Omniflow II biosynthetic vascular graft.\nWith respect to our RestoreFlow allografts, we rely on tissue procurement organizations to provide donated tissue to us for processing and cryopreservation. While we have relationships with multiple tissue procurement organizations, we cannot be sure that the supply of suitable human tissue will be available to us at the levels we need, in which case our allografts revenues could be adversely affected.\nWhen we acquire a product line, we often enter into an agreement with the seller of the product line for a period of one to three years for the supply of the acquired product until we can transition manufacturing to our facilities. Those arrangements are always sole source supply arrangements with a supplier that has determined to divest the product it is manufacturing. As a result, the supplier may not allocate sufficient resources to the manufacture of our product in favor of dedicating resources to its remaining business. Additionally, there is significant risk if the supplier does not have the financial means to continue to supply product. For example, in the case of our acquisition of the CardioCel and VascuCel biologic patches, Admedus Ltd and its affiliates have agreed to continue to supply those products to us for up to three years. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Admedus Ltd reported revenue from continuing operations of AU$25.6 million and a loss before income tax from continuing operations of AU$24.7 million, and for the year ended December 31, 2019, Admedus Ltd reported revenue from continuing operations of AU$17.1 million and a loss before income tax from continuing operations of AU$6.2 million. If Admedus fails to meet its obligations under the supply agreement on a timely basis, or at all, then we may experience interruptions in our supply of the acquired products or we may not receive a future supply of the acquired products until we establish our own manufacturing. If we do not have sufficient supply of an acquired product, this could lead to loss of sales, customer dissatisfaction and damage to our reputation, and our financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.\nThere are relatively few, or in some cases no, alternative, validated sources of supply for these materials and products. We do not always have supply agreements in place with suppliers, instead placing orders on an as-needed basis. At any time, these suppliers could discontinue or become incapable of the manufacture or supply of these materials or products on acceptable terms or otherwise. We do not ordinarily carry a significant inventory of these materials and products. Identifying and qualifying additional or replacement suppliers, if required, may not be accomplished quickly or at all and could involve significant additional costs. Any supply interruption from our suppliers or failure to obtain replacement suppliers would interrupt our ability to manufacture our products and result in production delays and increased costs, and may limit our ability to deliver products to our customers. This could lead to loss of sales and customers, and our financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.\nAny disruption in our manufacturing facilities could harm our results of operations.\nOur principal worldwide executive, distribution, and manufacturing operations are located in five leased facilities located in Burlington, Massachusetts. We also have manufacturing sites in North Melbourne, Australia and Saint-Etienne, France and a tissue processing preservation and distribution facility in Fox River Grove, Illinois. These facilities and the equipment we use to manufacture our products would be difficult to replace and could require substantial lead-time to repair or replace in the event of a natural or man-made disaster. In such event, we could not shift production or processing to alternate manufacturing facilities, and we would be forced to rely on third-party manufacturers, if available at all. Although we carry insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from casualties, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses, including potential damage to our reputation, and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe depend on our senior management team and other key sales and technical personnel, and if we are unable to retain them or recruit additional qualified personnel we may not be able to manage our operations and meet our strategic objectives.\nWe depend on the continued services of our senior management team and other key sales and technical personnel, as well as our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel. Each of our key employees may terminate his or her employment with us at any time, and the loss of any of our senior management team or key employees could harm our business. Because we compete for such personnel with other companies, academic institutions, government entities, and other organizations, we may not be able to meet our future hiring needs or retain existing personnel on acceptable terms. Any loss or interruption of the services of our key personnel could also significantly reduce our ability to effectively manage our operations and meet our commercial or strategic objectives, because we cannot be sure that we would be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis when the need arises.\nCertain of our products contain materials derived from animal sources and may become subject to additional regulation.\nOur AlboGraft vascular graft, AlboSure vascular patch, Dialine II vascular graft, Wovex vascular graft, XenoSure biologic patch, ProCol vascular graft and CadioCel and VascuCel patch products contain bovine tissue or material derived from bovine sources, our Omniflow II Biosynthetic Vascular Graft contains ovine tissue, and our surgical glue contains porcine gelatin. Products that contain materials derived from animal sources, including food, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, are increasingly subject to scrutiny in the media and by regulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities are concerned about the potential for the transmission of disease from animals to humans via those materials. This public scrutiny has been particularly acute in Japan and Western Europe with respect to products derived from animal sources, because of concern that bovine materials infected with the agent that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy, otherwise known as BSE or mad cow disease, may, if ingested or implanted, cause a variant of the human Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, an ultimately fatal disease with no known cure. Cases of BSE in cattle discovered in Canada and the United States have increased awareness of the issue in North America. Certain regions or countries have issued regulations that require products to be processed from bovine tissue sourced from countries, like Australia or New Zealand, where no cases of BSE have occurred. Products that contain materials derived from animals, including our products, may become subject to additional regulation, or even be banned in certain countries, because of concern over the potential for the transmission of infectious agents. Significant new regulation, or a ban of our products, could impair our current business or our ability to expand our business, and in the case of a ban or suspension, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe face intense competition from other companies, technologies, and alternative medical procedures and we may not be able to compete effectively.\nThe segments in which we compete are highly competitive, subject to change, and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants. Although no one company competes against us in all of our product lines or services, a number of manufacturers of peripheral vascular devices have substantially greater capital resources, larger customer bases, broader product lines, larger sales forces, greater marketing and management resources, larger research and development staffs, and larger facilities than ours; have established reputations with our target customers; and have developed worldwide distribution channels that are more effective than ours. Our competitors could elect to devote additional resources to the segments in which we currently enjoy less competition. Also, although we currently have leading positions in the segments for some of our products, this is not true for all of our products. From time to time, we have experienced difficulties competing against large companies.\nRecent industry consolidation could make the competitive environment more difficult for smaller companies like ours. Our competitors may be companies who are larger than us and who have substantially greater financial, technological, research and development, regulatory, marketing, sales, and personnel resources than we do. Certain of these competitors are able to manufacture at lower costs and may therefore offer comparable products at lower prices. Certain of these competitors may also have greater experience in developing and further improving products, obtaining regulatory approvals, and manufacturing and marketing such products. Certain of these competitors may obtain patent protection or regulatory approval or clearance, or achieve product commercialization, before us, any of which could materially adversely affect us. Further, if the trend towards endovascular procedures versus open vascular procedures continues or accelerates, our competitors may be better poised to take advantage of that trend, since our main product lines are used primarily in open vascular procedures. Because of the size of the vascular disease market opportunity, competitors and potential competitors have dedicated significant resources to aggressively promote their products. Also, new product developments that could compete with us more effectively are likely because the vascular disease market is characterized by extensive research efforts and technological progress. Competitors may develop technologies and products that are safer, more effective, easier to use, less expensive, or more readily accepted than ours. Their products could make our technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive. Our competitors may also be able to achieve more efficient manufacturing and distribution operations than we can. In addition, many of our products face competition from alternative procedures that utilize a different kind of medical device that we do not currently sell. Increased competition could also result in price reductions and loss of market share, any of which could result in lower revenues and reduced gross profits.\nIf we are unable to increase our selling prices to customers, or if we are required to make price concessions, our rate of net sales growth could be reduced and our operating results could suffer.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, a material portion of our increases in net sales was driven by higher average selling prices to our hospital customers across several of our product lines, particularly with respect to sales of our LeMaitre Valvulotome and with respect to sales occurring in the United States. In the past, we have been able to rely upon our intellectual property position, our well-known brands, and our established reputation to implement price increases. We implemented a significant price increase in 2015 for our LeMaitre Valvulotome, and our ability to implement additional price increases with respect to that product in the future may be limited.\nAdditionally, we may become unable to implement further increases in the selling prices of our products:\n\u2022\nif healthcare spending is reduced, particularly in the United States, in response to government-enacted healthcare reform, general economic conditions, or the influence of accountable care organizations;\n\u2022\nif the reimbursement rates for the medical procedures in which our products are used are reduced or limited; or\n\u2022\nif competitors introduce lower-priced products of comparable safety and efficacy.\nWe also expect marketplace changes to increasingly place pressure on medical device pricing as hospitals join group purchasing organizations, integrated delivery networks, managed care organizations and other groups that seek to aggregate purchasing power and as hospitals are given financial incentives to improve quality and reduce costs. Due to pricing pressures, surgeons may even perform alternative procedures in which our products are unnecessary.\nIf we become unable to raise selling prices, or if we are required to make price concessions, it could reduce our rate of net sales growth and harm our operating results.\nThe risks inherent in operating internationally and the risks of selling and shipping our products and of purchasing our components and products internationally may adversely impact our net sales, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe derive a significant portion of our net sales from operations in markets outside of the United States. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 46% of our net sales were derived from operations outside of the United States. Our international sales operations expose us and our representatives, agents, and distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions. These risks include:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of additional U.S. and foreign governmental controls or regulations, including export licensing requirements, duties and tariffs, and other trade restrictions, whether due to, or in reaction to, changes in U.S. trade policy;\n\u2022\nthe risk of non-compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by our sales representatives or our distributors;\n\u2022\nchanging medical device regulations that may impede our ability to register our products in a jurisdiction;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of U.S. and/or international sanctions against a country, company, person, or entity with whom we do business that would restrict or prohibit continued business with the sanctioned country, company, person, or entity, whether due to, or in reaction to, changes in U.S. foreign policy;\n\u2022\na shortage of high-quality sales personnel and distributors;\n\u2022\nloss of any key personnel who possess proprietary knowledge, or who are otherwise important to our success in certain international markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in third-party reimbursement policies that may require some of the patients who receive our products to directly absorb medical costs or that may necessitate the reduction of the selling prices of our products;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives, and distributors;\n\u2022\nscrutiny of foreign tax authorities, which could result in significant fines, penalties, and additional taxes being imposed on us;\n\u2022\npricing pressure that we may experience internationally;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing or defending intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nexposure to different legal and political standards; and\n\u2022\npolitical, economic, and/or social instability.\nWe cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not harm our business. Any material decrease in our international sales would adversely impact our net sales, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOutbreaks of pandemic diseases, such as the novel coronavirus, Covid-19, could cause disruptions in our business.\nIn addition to the above risks related to our international operations, we also face risks related to disease outbreaks, such as the recent outbreak of Covid-19, first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. An outbreak of a contagious disease, particularly to extent it becomes pandemic, could significantly disrupt our business operations. The effects of such an outbreak include restrictions on our ability to travel to support our sites in Asia/Pacific Rim and other impacted territories or our customers located there, disruptions in our ability to distribute products, reduced sales of our products in territories where widespread quarantines due to the disease have been imposed, and/or temporary closures of our facilities in Asia/Pacific Rim and other impacted territories. In addition, a significant geographic spread of a pandemic such as Covid-19, an increase in the severity of the outbreak and/or a prolonged duration of the outbreak could adversely affect the global economy, which could result in reduced demand for our products. Any of these events could lead to a loss of sales and harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nLegal, political and economic uncertainty surrounding the exit of the U.K. from the EU may be a source of instability in international markets, create significant currency fluctuations, adversely affect our operations in the U.K. and pose additional risks to our business, revenue, financial condition, and results of operations..\nFollowing the result of a referendum in 2016, the U.K. left the EU on January 31, 2020. Pursuant to the formal withdrawal arrangements agreed between the U.K. and the EU, the U.K. will be subject to a transition period under December 31, 2020 (the Transition Period), during which EU rules will continue to apply. Negotiations between the U.K. and the EU are expected to continue in relation to the customs and trading relationship between the U.K. and the EU following the expiry of the Transition Period.\nThe uncertainty concerning the U.K\u2019s legal, political and economic relationship with the EU after the Transition Period may be a source of instability in the international markets, create significant currency fluctuations, and/or otherwise adversely affect trading agreements or similar cross-border co-operation arrangements (whether economic, tax, fiscal, legal, regulatory or otherwise).\nThese developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, have had, and may continue to have, a significant adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and could significantly reduce global market liquidity and limit the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. In particular, it could also lead to a period of considerable uncertainty in relation to the U.K. financial and banking markets, as well as on the regulatory process in Europe. Asset valuations, currency exchange rates and credit ratings may also be subject to increased market volatility.\nIf the U.K. and the EU are unable to negotiate acceptable trading and customs terms or if other EU Member States pursue withdrawal, barrier-free access between the U.K. and other EU Member States or among the European Economic Area overall could be diminished or eliminated. The long-term effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements (or lack thereof) between the U.K. and the EU and, in particular, any arrangements for the U.K. to retain access to EU markets after the Transition Period.\nSuch a withdrawal from the EU is unprecedented, and it is unclear how the U.K.\u2019s access to the European single market for goods, capital, services and labor within the EU, or single market, and the wider commercial, legal and regulatory environment, will impact our U.K. operations and customers. We currently ship products to the U.K. from our Sulzbach, Germany location. If Brexit results in greater restrictions on imports and exports between the U.K. and the EU, we may find it necessary to make operational changes to adapt to those restrictions. We may be unable to make such changes in a commercially reasonable or timely manner or at all. Additionally, this could result in higher costs of doing business in the U.K. and possibly the EU. We opened our Hereford, England office in October 2019 principally to help manage these issues.\nThe use or misuse of our products and tissues we distribute may result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business.\nIf our products or the tissue we process and preserve are defectively designed, manufactured, processed or labeled, contain defective components, or are misused, or if our products or the tissues we process and preserve are found to have caused or contributed to injuries or death, we may become subject to costly litigation by our customers or their patients. Although we offer training for physicians, we do not require that physicians be trained in the use of our products or the tissues we distribute, and physicians may use our products or the tissues we distribute incorrectly or in procedures not contemplated by us. We are from time to time involved in product liability claims. Product liability claims could divert management\u2019s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend, and result in sizable damage awards against us. Claims of this nature may also adversely affect our reputation, which could damage our position in the market and subject us to recalls.\nWe cannot assure you that our product liability insurance coverage will be sufficient to satisfy any claim made against us. Further, we may not be able to maintain the same level of coverage, and we may not be able to obtain adequate coverage at a reasonable cost and on reasonable terms, if at all. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing coverage in the future. Additionally, if any such product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or is in excess of our insurance coverage, our business could be harmed.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in litigation where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense.\nWe are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and litigation, including, but not limited to, actions relating to product liability, employment matters, intellectual property, contract disputes and other commercial matters. Because the outcome of litigation is inherently difficult to predict, it is possible that the outcome of litigation, or even simply the defense of litigation, could entail significant cost for us, divert management\u2019s time and attention and harm our business. Additionally, we could experience adverse effects of litigation even before finally adjudicated if a counterparty is granted intermediate relief such as an injunction. Even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees. The fact that we operate in international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal exposures as we seek to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements. If any such proceedings were to result in an unfavorable outcome, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to convert additional countries or products from distributor sales to direct sales, or encounter difficulties in effecting such conversions, our results of operations could suffer.\nWe have a history of converting international distributor sales to direct-to-hospital sales by buying out our foreign distributor agreements and selling direct-to-hospital through our own direct sales representatives. In the future, we may elect to convert select additional countries and products from distributor sales to direct-to-hospital sales. Such conversions sometimes result in disruptions in our sales in the applicable geographies. These transitions may also have an adverse effect on our cash flow because distributors, unlike direct sales representatives, pay us for inventory that they stock for later sale. In addition, switching to a direct sales force may subject us to longer customer collection times and larger bad debt expense, since we would be required to collect customer payments directly rather than bill and collect from the single distributor.\nOur distribution agreements are exclusive, where permissible, with terms of up to five years. These agreements may temporarily constrain our ability to convert certain countries or products from a distributor to a direct-to-hospital model. In order to ensure a successful market transition, we may compensate a distributor in connection with the termination of their distributorship, even where the payment of compensation is not required by contract or local law.\nFollowing termination of any distribution agreement, we may encounter difficulties in transitioning to a direct-to-hospital model. The transition to a direct sales model may require us to meet regulatory requirements that were previously the responsibility of the distributor, which may subject us to additional costs. It also may take us longer than expected to find qualified sales personnel to establish an effective sales force, which could negatively impact projected sales. If a distributor sold our products through a network of sales agents, rather than exclusively through its own personnel, we may not be able to establish relationships with all members of that network, temporarily limiting our access to the existing market. Similarly, failure to maintain or quickly re-establish a distributor\u2019s close relationships with the physicians who use our products could reduce sales. Further, it may be difficult or impossible to transfer the assignment of a distributor\u2019s rights to sell our products, and as a result, sales to customers may be delayed until a new agreement or approval is obtained. The transition to a direct sales model may also require us to incur additional expenses and may be time-consuming to manage remotely, as is the case with our sales office in China. As a result of these risks, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in transitioning to a direct sales model in the countries that we select, and difficulties that we encounter in these transitions could negatively affect our business.\nFluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar and other currencies may adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur results of operations are reported in U.S. dollars. While the majority of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our revenue and costs is denominated in other currencies, such as the Euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Canadian dollar, the Chinese yuan and the Australian dollar. As of December 31, 2019, 46% of our net sales were to customers outside the U.S., largely in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, we face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. Our results of operations and our operating expenses are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of those operations are translated from local currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. If the U.S. dollar weakens against the local currency, the translation of these foreign currency-based local operations will result in increased net assets, revenue, operating expenses, and net income. Similarly, our local currency-based net assets, revenue, operating expenses, and net income will decrease if the U.S. dollar strengthens against the local currency. Additionally, receivable and payable balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency may result in gains and losses upon settlement that may adversely impact our results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Regulatory Environment\nOversight of the medical device industry might affect the manner in which we may sell medical devices and compete in the marketplace.\nThere are laws and regulations that govern the means by which companies in the healthcare industry may market their products and services to healthcare professionals and may compete by discounting the prices of their products and services, including for example, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, state law equivalents to these federal laws that are meant to protect against fraud and abuse and analogous laws in foreign countries. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Although in structuring our sales and marketing practices and customer discount arrangements we strive to comply with those laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that:\n\u2022\ngovernment officials charged with responsibility for enforcing those laws will not assert that our sales and marketing practices or customer discount arrangements are in violation of those laws or regulations; or\n\u2022\ngovernment regulators or courts will interpret those laws or regulations in a manner consistent with our interpretation.\nFederal and state laws are also sometimes open to interpretation, and from time to time we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage if our interpretation differs from that of our competitors.\nOur business is subject to complex, costly, and burdensome regulations. We could be subject to significant penalties if we fail to comply.\nThe production and marketing of our products and services and our ongoing research and development are subject to extensive regulation and review by numerous governmental authorities both in the United States and abroad. U.S. and foreign regulations applicable to medical devices and human tissues are wide-ranging and govern, among other things, the testing, marketing, and premarket clearance or approval of new medical devices and services related to human tissues, as applicable, in addition to regulating manufacturing and processing practices, reporting, promotion and advertising, importing and exporting, labeling, and record-keeping procedures.\nOur failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in governmental agencies or a court taking action, including any of the following:\n\u2022\nissuing public warning letters to us;\n\u2022\nimposing fines and penalties on us;\n\u2022\nissuing an injunction preventing us from manufacturing, processing, selling or distributing our products;\n\u2022\nbringing civil or criminal charges against us;\n\u2022\ndelaying the introduction of our new products into the market;\n\u2022\nordering a recall of, or detaining or seizing, our products or cryopreserved human tissue; or\n\u2022\nwithdrawing or denying approvals or clearances for our products.\nIf any or all of the foregoing were to occur, our business, results of operations, and reputation could suffer.\nIf we are not successful in obtaining and maintaining clearances and approvals from governmental agencies for our medical devices, we will not be able to sell our products, and our future growth will be significantly hampered.\nOur products require premarket clearance or approval in the United States and the CE Mark or other approvals in foreign countries where they are sold. Each medical device that we wish to market in the United States generally must receive either 510(k) clearance or approval of a premarket application, or PMA, from the FDA before the product can be marketed or sold. Either process can be lengthy and expensive. The FDA\u2019s 510(k) clearance procedure usually takes three to twelve months from the date the FDA receives the application, but may take longer. Although 510(k) clearances have been obtained for nearly all of our current products that require such clearances, the FDA may condition, limit or prohibit our sales of these products if safety or effectiveness problems develop with the devices. Our new products or significantly modified existing products could be denied 510(k) clearance and required to undergo the more burdensome PMA approval process if they are not found to be substantially equivalent.\nThe PMA approval process is much more costly, lengthy, and uncertain than the premarket notification process. It generally takes from six months to three years from the date the application is submitted to, and filed with, the FDA, and may take longer. Achieving premarket approval typically requires extensive clinical trials and may require the filing of numerous amendments with the FDA over time. The FDA may also require post-approval studies to continue demonstrating the safe and effective performance of these devices. We do not have significant experience in obtaining PMA approval or conducting these studies for our products.\nThe FDA has previously proposed changes for which FDA clearance to market would possibly require clinical data, more extensive manufacturing information and post market data. As part of the 510(k) reform, the FDA proposes to issue regulations defining grounds and procedures for rescission of 510(k) applications that have previously been cleared to market. Additionally, in April 2018, the FDA announced the Medical Device Safety Action Plan: Protecting Patients, Promoting Public Health in which the FDA has proposed limiting the age of predicate devices used in 510(k) applications, thus narrowing the field of available predicates for comparison in the 510(k) process. The FDA may also require the more extensive PMA process for certain products. Our ability to market our products outside the United States is also subject to regulatory approval, including our ability to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our products in the clinical setting. Even if regulatory approval or clearance of a product is granted, the approval or clearance could limit the uses or the claims for which the product may be labeled and promoted, which may limit the market for our products. If we do not obtain and maintain foreign regulatory or FDA approval with respect to our products, as applicable, we will not be able to sell our products, and our future growth will be significantly hampered.\nIf we or some of our suppliers fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation and other applicable requirements, our manufacturing or processing operations could be disrupted, our sales and profitability could suffer, and we may become subject to a wide variety of FDA enforcement actions.\nWe are subject to inspection and marketing surveillance by the FDA to determine our compliance with all regulatory requirements. If the FDA finds that we have failed to comply with any regulatory requirements, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions.\nWe and some of our suppliers must comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, which governs the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, testing, manufacture, control, quality assurance, installation, servicing, labeling, packaging, storage, and shipping of medical devices. Our Fox River Grove operations must comply with the FDA\u2019s current Good Tissue Practices, which are the FDA regulatory requirements for the processing of human tissue. The FDA enforces its regulations through pre-announced and unannounced inspections. We have been, and anticipate in the future being, subject to such inspections by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. The timing and scope of future audits is unknown and it is possible, despite our belief that our quality systems and the operation of our manufacturing facilities will remain in compliance with U.S, and non-U.S. regulatory requirements, that a future audit may result in one or more unsatisfactory results. If we or one of our suppliers fails an inspection, or if a corrective action plan adopted by us or one of our suppliers is not sufficient, the FDA may bring an enforcement action against us, and our operations could be disrupted and our manufacturing delayed.\nWe are also subject to the FDA\u2019s general prohibition against promoting our products for unapproved or off-label uses and to the medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to the FDA if our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or if our device malfunctions and a recurrence of the malfunction would likely result in a death or serious injury. We must also file reports with the FDA of some device corrections and removals, and we must adhere to the FDA\u2019s rules on labeling and promotion. If we fail to comply with these or other FDA requirements or fail to take adequate corrective action in response to any significant compliance issue raised by the FDA, the FDA can take significant enforcement actions, which could harm our business, results of operations, and our reputation.\nIn addition, most other countries, such as Japan, require us to comply with manufacturing and quality assurance standards for medical devices that are similar to those in force in the United States before marketing and selling our products in those countries. If we fail to comply, we would lose our ability to market and sell our products in those foreign countries.\nEven after our products have received marketing approval or clearance, our products and the tissue we process may be subject to product recalls. Licenses, registrations, approvals and clearances could be withdrawn or suspended due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval.\nOur products, services, marketing, sales and development activities, and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA, by comparable agencies in foreign countries, and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies. These authorities have been increasing their scrutiny of our industry. If those regulatory bodies feel that we have failed to comply with regulatory standards or if we encounter unforeseen problems following initial approval, licensure or registration, there can be no assurance that any approval, licensure or registration will not be subsequently withdrawn, suspended or conditioned upon extensive post-market study requirements, even after having received marketing approval or clearance or licenses and registrations. Further, due to the increased scrutiny of our industry by the various regulatory agencies and the interconnectedness of the various regulatory agencies, particularly within the EU, there is also no assurance that withdrawal or suspension of any of our approvals, licenses or registrations by any single regulatory agency will not precipitate one or more additional regulatory agencies from also withdrawing or suspending their approval, license or registration.\nIn the event that any of our products proves to be defective, we can voluntarily recall, or the FDA or foreign equivalent could require us to implement a recall of or prohibit the sale of, any of our products. For example, in 2019 we recalled certain lots of catheters manufactured by Applied Medical due to an issue with premature material degradation. Recalls, whether voluntary or required, could result in significant costs to us and significant adverse publicity, which could harm our ability to market our products in the future.\nWith respect to our RestoreFlow allografts, we may voluntarily recall tissue, and in the event of non-compliance with the regulations governing human tissue, the FDA may issue a warning letter, order the recall and/or destruction of tissues and/or order the suspension or cessation of processing and preservation of new tissues.\nAdditionally, if someone is harmed by a malfunction or a product defect, we may experience product liability claims for such defects. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, will require the dedication of our time and capital and may harm our reputation and financial results. Future recalls or claims could also result in significant costs to us and significant adverse publicity, which could harm our ability to market our products in the future.\nDomestic and foreign legislative or administrative reforms resulting in restrictive reimbursement practices of third-party payors and cost containment measures could decrease the demand for products purchased by our customers, the prices that our customers are willing to pay for those products and the number of procedures using our devices.\nOur products and our tissue preservation services are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians which typically bill various third-party payors, such as governmental programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and comparable foreign programs), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from third-party payors is critical to the success of our products and services because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Reimbursement varies by country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new technology. Implementation of healthcare reforms in the United States and in significant overseas markets such as Germany, Japan, France and other countries may limit, reduce or eliminate reimbursement for our products and services and adversely affect both our pricing flexibility and the demand for our products and services. Even when we develop or acquire a promising new product or service, we may find limited demand for the product or service unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental third-party payors.\nMajor third-party payors for hospital services in the United States and abroad continue to work to contain healthcare costs through, among other things, the introduction of cost containment incentives and closer scrutiny of healthcare expenditures by both private health insurers and employers. For example, in an effort to decrease costs, certain hospitals and other customers may resterilize our products intended for a single use or purchase reprocessed products from third-party reprocessors in lieu of purchasing new products from us.\nFurther legislative or administrative reforms to the reimbursement systems in the United States and abroad, or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement, could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or result in the denial of coverage for those procedures. Examples of these reforms or adverse decisions include price regulation, competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements. Any of such reforms or adverse decisions resulting in restrictive reimbursement practices or denials of coverage could have an adverse impact on the acceptance of our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or prevent use of our intellectual property by third parties, we could lose a significant competitive advantage and our business may suffer.\nOur success depends in part on obtaining, maintaining, and enforcing our intellectual property rights, trademarks, and other proprietary rights, and our ability to avoid infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We take precautionary steps to protect our technological advantages and intellectual property. We rely upon patent, trade secret, copyright, know-how, and trademark laws, as well as license agreements and contractual provisions, to establish our intellectual property rights and protect our products. These measures may only afford limited protection and may not:\n\u2022\nprevent our competitors from duplicating our products or services;\n\u2022\nprevent our competitors from gaining access to our proprietary information and technology; or\n\u2022\npermit us to gain or maintain a competitive advantage.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or enforceability. Any patents we have obtained or will obtain in the future might also be invalidated or circumvented by third parties. In addition, any pending patent applications may not issue as patents or, if issued, may not provide commercially meaningful protection, as competitors may be able to design around our patents to produce alternative, non-infringing designs. Should such challenges to our patents be successful, competitors might be able to market products and use manufacturing processes that are substantially similar to ours. Furthermore, patents expire after a certain duration, depending on the jurisdiction in which issued. To the extent any manufacturers are successful in challenging our patents or they enter the market following the expiration of our patents, this could have an adverse impact on our business and harm our sales and operating results.\nAdditionally, we may not be able to effectively protect our rights in unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information. We have a policy of requiring key employees and consultants and corporate partners with access to trade secrets or other confidential information to execute confidentiality agreements. Our confidentiality agreements also require our employees to assign to us all rights to any inventions made or conceived during their employment with us. We also generally require our consultants to assign to us any inventions made during the course of their engagement by us. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for us in the event of unauthorized use, transfer, or disclosure of confidential information or inventions.\nIn addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights effectively or to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If our intellectual property rights are not adequately protected, we may not be able to commercialize our technologies, products, or services and our competitors could commercialize similar technologies, which could result in a decrease in our sales and market share.\nIf third parties claim that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights, we may incur liabilities and costs, and we may have to redesign or discontinue selling the affected product.\nThe medical device industry is litigious with respect to patents and other intellectual property rights. Companies operating in our industry routinely seek patent protection for their product designs, and many of our principal competitors have large patent portfolios. Companies in the medical device industry have used intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage. Whether a product infringes a patent or other intellectual property rights involves complex legal and factual issues, the determination of which is often uncertain. We face the risk of claims that we have infringed on third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights, and we cannot assure you that our products or methods do not infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Our efforts to identify and avoid infringing on third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights may not always be successful. Any claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could:\n\u2022\nbe expensive and time consuming to defend;\n\u2022\nresult in us being required to pay significant damages to third parties for past use of the asserted intellectual property;\n\u2022\nharm our reputation;\n\u2022\ncause us to cease making or selling products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022\nrequire us to redesign, reengineer, or rebrand our products, which may not be possible and could be costly and time consuming if it is possible to do so at all;\n\u2022\nrequire us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party\u2019s intellectual property, which agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all;\n\u2022\ndivert the attention of our management and key personnel from other tasks important to the success of our business; or\n\u2022\nresult in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of the affected products until resolution of the litigation.\nIt is also possible that a third party could claim that our manufacturing process violates an existing patent or other intellectual property rights. If we were unsuccessful in defending such a claim, we may be forced to stop production at one or more of our manufacturing facilities.\nIn addition, new patents obtained by our competitors could threaten a product\u2019s continued life in the market even after it has already been introduced. If our business is successful, the possibility may increase that others will assert infringement claims against us.\nIf we believe our product is or may be the subject of a patent or other intellectual property rights of a third party, we may attempt to reach a license agreement with them to manufacture, market, and sell these products. If we fail to reach an agreement, we could be required to pay significant damages to third parties for past use of the asserted intellectual property and may be forced to cease making or selling products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property.\nIn addition, we may become subject to interference proceedings conducted in the United States Patent Office or opposition proceedings conducted in foreign patent offices challenging the priority of invention or the validity of our patents.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile, and an investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value.\nThere can be significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities that is unrelated to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities. These broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. Shareholders may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price at which they purchased them due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects, a reduced volume of trading in our common stock, and other factors.\nSome factors that may have a significant effect on our common stock market price include:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or future prospects;\n\u2022\nour announcements or our competitors\u2019 announcements of new products;\n\u2022\npublic concern as to the safety or efficacy of our products and services;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements, and our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nour determination whether or not to continue the payment of quarterly cash dividends;\n\u2022\nour determination whether or not to undertake or continue a share repurchase program;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures or restructurings;\n\u2022\ndilutive issuances of additional securities;\n\u2022\nchanges in our growth rates or our competitors\u2019 growth rates;\n\u2022\ndevelopments regarding our patents or proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nour inability to raise additional capital;\n\u2022\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nthe discontinuation of a product line or other revenue generating activity;\n\u2022\nadverse regulatory actions which may necessitate recalls of our products or services or warning letters that negatively affect the markets for our products or services;\n\u2022\nsales of common stock by us or our directors, officers, or principal stockholders;\n\u2022\ncontrol by our affiliates and insiders of a significant percentage of our common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding our common stock, comparable companies, or our industry generally;\n\u2022\nreduced or lower volume of trading in our common stock; and\n\u2022\nour inclusion in or removal from stock market indices, such as the S&P 600 or Russell 2000.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought. This litigation, if brought against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur chief executive officer has significant voting power and may take actions that may not align with the interests of our other stockholders.\nOur chief executive officer and the LeMaitre Family LLC collectively control approximately 16% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2019. As a result, these stockholders, if they were to act together, could have significant influence on many matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control, might adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and may not be fully aligned with the interests of other stockholders.\nWe have not established a minimum dividend payment level for our common stockholders and there are no assurances of our ability to pay dividends to common stockholders in the future.\nIn February 2011, our Board of Directors adopted a quarterly dividend program for the purpose of returning capital to our stockholders. However, we have not established a minimum dividend payment level for our common stockholders and our ability to pay dividends may be harmed by the risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the other documents we file from time to time with the SEC. Future dividends, if any, will be authorized by our Board of Directors and declared by us based upon a variety of factors deemed relevant by our directors, including, among other things, our financial condition, liquidity, earnings projections and business prospects. In addition, financial covenants in any credit facility to which we become a party may restrict our ability to pay future quarterly dividends. We can provide no assurance of our ability to pay dividends in the future.", "PERMNO": 91503, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "LMAT"}
