{"cik": "887247", "company": "Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should consider carefully the following information about the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public filings in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected by these risks if any of them actually occurs. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock would likely decline. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or other factors not perceived by us to present significant risks to our business at this time also may impair our business.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition\nThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared using the generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, as shown in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, included in this Report, we have sustained substantial recurring losses from operations. In addition, we have used, rather than provided, cash in our continuing operations. The above conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in existence. Uncertainty concerning our ability to continue as a going concern, among other factors, may hinder our ability to obtain future financing. Continued operations and our ability to continue as a going concern are dependent, among other factors, on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize products, the market acceptance and success of our products and our ability to obtain additional required funding If we cannot continue as a viable entity, our stockholders would likely lose most or all of their investment in us.\nWe will require additional funding to continue as a going concern.\nWe incurred significant net losses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The development of our business will require additional capital to help fund the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates, conduct research, development and trials relating to our product candidates, fund our ongoing operations and satisfy our obligations and liabilities. There are no assurances that required funding will be available at all or will be available in sufficient amounts or on reasonable terms. In addition to product revenues, we have historically relied upon sales of our equity or debt securities to fund our operations. We currently have no available balance in our credit facility or committed sources of capital, and a number of factors may limit or prevent our current ability to access capital markets to obtain any required funding. Delays in obtaining, or the inability to obtain, required funding from debt or equity financings, sales of assets, sales or out-licenses of intellectual property or technologies, or other transactions or sources, could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercially introduce products and cause us to be unable to comply with our obligations under outstanding instruments, and could adversely affect our ability to continue operations. In addition, our previously announced sale of assets pursuant to the USC Agreement relating to the human compounding pharmaceuticals business of our USC subsidiary, together with our previously announced process of winding down, winding up and disposing of the remaining operations, business and assets of USC, will result in the company not receiving revenues in the future from sales of products by USC, other than the consideration receivable by the company pursuant to the terms of the USC Agreement or from other agreements or arrangements relating to the sale or disposition of the remaining USC assets.\nOur ability to obtain required financing will be subject to a number of factors, including without limitation market conditions, our capitalization, our operating performance and investor sentiment. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates, restrict our operations or obtain funds by entering into agreements on unattractive terms, which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, stock price and our relationships with third parties with whom we have business relationships, and which could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. If we do not have sufficient funds to continue operations, we could be required to seek bankruptcy protection or other alternatives that would likely result in our stockholders losing some or all of their investment in us.\nStatements in this Report concerning our future plans and operations are dependent on our ability to secure adequate funding and the absence of unexpected delays or adverse developments. We may not be able to secure required funding.\nThe statements contained in this Report concerning future events or developments or our future activities, such as concerning current or planned clinical trials, anticipated research and development activities, anticipated dates for commencement of clinical trials, anticipated completion dates of clinical trials, anticipated meetings with the FDA or other regulatory authorities concerning our product candidates, anticipated dates for submissions to obtain required regulatory marketing approvals, anticipated dates for commercial introduction of products, anticipated outcome of any legal proceedings in which we are involved, and other statements concerning our future operations and activities, are forward-looking statements that in each instance assume that we have or are able to obtain sufficient funding to support such activities and continue our operations and planned activities in a timely manner. There can be no assurance that this will be the case. Also, such statements assume that there are no significant unexpected developments or events that delay or prevent such activities from occurring. Failure to timely obtain any required additional funding, or unexpected developments or events, could delay the occurrence of such events or prevent the events described in any such statements from occurring which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe restated our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the interim periods of 2020, which may lead to additional risks and uncertainties, including loss of investor confidence and negative impacts on our business, financial condition and stock price.\nOn April 14, 2021, we concluded that, because of a misapplication of valuation principles used to determine the amount of our non-cash warrant liabilities and the associated gain or loss recognized as a result of the change in the fair value of the warrant liabilities, relating to warrants that we issued in August 2019 (the \u201c2019 Warrants\u201d) and February 2020 (the \u201c2020 Warrants\u201d and, together with the 2019 Warrants, the \u201cWarrants\u201d), our previous quarterly and year-to-date unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2020 (the \u201cAffected Periods\u201d), should no longer be relied upon. As a result, we restated our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the Affected Periods. The issues identified were all non-cash and did not impact our revenues, operating expenses, operating loss, cash and cash equivalents, assets, liquidity or cash position for the Affected Periods or the year ended December 31, 2020. As a result of the foregoing matters, or if we determine in the future that other financial restatements are required, we may become subject to additional risks and uncertainties, including, among others, unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees, the increased possibility of legal proceedings, shareholder lawsuits, governmental agency investigations, and inquiries by the Nasdaq Stock Market or other regulatory bodies, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, shareholder class actions or derivative actions. We could face monetary judgments, penalties or other sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause our stock price to decline. If any such actions occur, they will, regardless of the outcome, consume a significant amount of management\u2019s time and attention and may result in additional legal, accounting, insurance and other costs. If we do not prevail in any such proceedings, we could be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs. In addition, any restatement or related matters could impair our reputation. Each of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nWe have incurred losses since our inception, and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses. We may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe incurred significant net losses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, as reflected in the financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. We expect that these losses may continue as we continue our research and development activities, seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates and seek to commercialize any approved products. These losses will cause, among other things, our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital to decrease. Any future earnings and cash flow from operations of our business are dependent on our ability to further develop our products and on revenue and profitability from sales of products.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient product revenue and amounts payable to us under our commercialization agreement relating to our SYMJEPI and ZIMHI products or other commercialization agreements that we may enter into to become profitable at all or on a sustained basis. We expect to have quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in revenue and expenses, some of which could be significant, due in part to variations in expenses and activities relating to research, development, clinical trials, marketing and manufacturing. If our product candidates fail in clinical trials or do not gain regulatory approval, or if our products do not achieve market acceptance, we may never become profitable. As we commercialize and market products, we may incur expenses for product marketing and brand awareness and conduct significant research, development, testing and regulatory compliance activities that, together with general and administrative expenses, could result in substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nWe have received grand jury subpoenas issued in connection with a criminal investigation.\nAs we have previously disclosed, on May 11, 2021, each of the company and its USC subsidiary received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York (the \u201cUSAO\u201d) issued in connection with a criminal investigation, requesting a broad range of documents and materials relating to, among other matters, certain veterinary products sold by the company\u2019s USC subsidiary, certain practices, agreements and arrangements relating to products sold by USC, including veterinary products, and certain regulatory and other matters relating to the company and USC. The Audit Committee of the Board engaged outside counsel to conduct an independent internal investigation to review these and other matters. Additional issues or facts could arise or be determined, which may expand the scope, duration, or outcome of the investigation. In addition to the subpoena from the USAO, the company has also received requests from the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) for the voluntary production of documents and information relating to the subject matter of the USAO\u2019s subpoenas and certain other matters. The company has produced documents and will continue to produce and provide documents in response to the subpoenas and requests, and interact with the USAO and SEC concerning the foregoing matters. The company intends to cooperate with the USAO and the SEC. At this time, the company is unable to predict the duration, scope, or outcome of the investigations by the USAO, SEC, or other agencies, or determine what, if any, proceedings the USAO, SEC, or other federal or state authorities may initiate, what, if any, remedies or remedial measures the USAO, SEC, or other federal or state authorities may seek, or what, if any, impact the foregoing matters may have on the company\u2019s business, previously reported financial results, financial results included in this Report, or future financial results. We could receive additional requests from the USAO, SEC, or other authorities, which may require further investigation. There can be no assurance that any discussions with the SEC or USAO to resolve these matters will be successful. The foregoing matters may divert management\u2019s attention, cause the company to suffer reputational harm, require the company to devote significant financial resources, subject the company and its officers and directors to civil or criminal proceedings and depending on the resolution of the matters or any proceedings, result in fines, penalties, equitable remedies, and affect the company\u2019s business, previously reported financial results, financial results included in this Report, or future financial results. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur PPP loans may be audited or reviewed by federal or state regulatory authorities.\nWe applied for and obtained loan funding under the PPP pursuant to the PPP Loan and PPP Note, the balance of which has been forgiven, and under the Second Draw PPP Loan and PPP2 Note in the principal amount of $1,765,495, the balance of which has also been forgiven. However, even though the PPP Loan and the Second Draw PPP Loan have been forgiven, our PPP loans and applications for forgiveness of loan amounts remain subject to future review and audit by SBA for compliance with program requirements set forth in the PPP Interim Final Rules and in the Borrower Application Form, including without limitation the required economic necessity certification by the company that was part of the PPP loan application process. Accordingly, the company is subject to audit or review by federal or state regulatory authorities as a result of applying for and obtaining the PPP Loan and Second Draw PPP Loan or obtaining forgiveness of those loans. If we were to be audited or reviewed and receive an adverse determination or finding in such audit or review, we could be required to return or repay the full amount of the applicable loan and could be subject to fines or penalties, which could reduce our liquidity and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If it is determined that the company was ineligible to receive the PPP Loan and/or the Second Draw Loan, the company may be required to repay the PPP Loan and Second Draw Loan in its entirety and/or be subject to additional penalties, which could reduce our liquidity and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisk Relating to Our Business and Industry\nWe may never commercialize additional product candidates that are subject to regulatory approval or earn a profit.\nExcept for our SYMJEPI and ZIMHI products, we have not received regulatory approval for any drugs or products. Since our fiscal 2010 year, except for revenues from sales of compounded pharmacy formulations after our acquisition of USC in 2016 and amounts that we have received and may receive in the future pursuant to our commercialization agreements relating to our SYMJEPI and ZIMHI products, we have not generated commercial revenue from marketing or selling any drugs or other products. We expect to incur substantial net losses for the foreseeable future. We may never be able to commercialize any additional product candidates that are subject to regulatory approval or be able to generate revenue from sales of such products. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with developing and commercializing our specialty pharmaceuticals and other product candidates, we are unable to predict when we may commercially introduce such products, the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable, if ever.\nOur development plans concerning our products and product candidates are affected by many factors, the outcome of which are difficult to predict.\nThe development of new pharmaceutical products is a highly risky undertaking. Our potential products may require significant additional research and development before any commercial introduction. Our product development plans concerning our products and product candidates, and the anticipated dates for development and introduction of products in our product pipeline, are affected by many factors, many of which are difficult to predict. Some of the factors that could affect our development plans for our products and product candidates include: general market conditions and developments in the marketplace including the introduction of potentially competing new products by our competitors; the availability of adequate funding to support product development efforts and sales and marketing efforts for approved products; the outcome of discussions with the FDA concerning the regulatory pathway for our products and the number and kind of clinical trials that the FDA will require before the FDA will consider regulatory approval of the applicable product; the time required to conduct required clinical trials and unexpected delays in the anticipated timing of the commencement, conduct or completion of clinical trials; the outcome and results of clinical trials; the FDA\u2019s review and acceptance of NDAs that we may file concerning our product candidates; any unexpected difficulties in licensing or sublicensing intellectual property rights that may be required for other components of the product; patent infringement lawsuits relating to Paragraph IV certifications as part of any Section 505(b)(2) or ANDA filings; any unexpected difficulties in the ability of our suppliers to timely supply quantities for commercial launch of the product; and our ability to successfully market and sell our products or enter into commercialization arrangements with third parties to market our products. There can be no assurance that any future research, development or clinical trial efforts will result in viable products or meet efficacy standards. Future clinical or preclinical results may be negative or insufficient to allow us to successfully develop and market our product candidates. Obtaining needed data and results may take longer than planned or may not be obtained at all. Any such delays or setbacks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our financial goals.\nBusiness or economic disruptions or global health concerns, including the COVID-19 pandemic, could harm our business.\nBusiness or economic disruptions or global health concerns, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our business. The novel strain of coronavirus and the related COVID-19 pandemic, which the World Health Organization announced in January 2020 was a global health emergency and which has continued, has spread throughout most of the world including the United States. The outbreak resulted in extended shutdowns of businesses in the United States and elsewhere and has had ripple effects on businesses and activities around the world.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak and continued spread of COVID-19, including the identification of novel strains of COVID-19, has affected and may continue to affect our operations, our customers and third parties on which we rely. Restrictions on outpatient surgeries and other medical procedures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in part due to reductions or cancellations of elective surgeries and reductions in office visits to physicians\u2019 offices, healthcare facilities or clinics by patients, decreased demand from USC\u2019s customers for certain of USC\u2019s products and adversely affected revenues from sales of USC products in 2020 and 2021, and may continue to adversely affect revenues from sales of products to customers covered by the USC Agreement. In addition, we could experience delays in obtaining products or services from our third party manufacturers or suppliers as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on such parties. The pandemic and related matters also could result in interruptions or delays in the operations of the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which may impact review and approval timelines relating to our NDAs or other actions relating to our products or product candidates, or could result in delays relating to patient enrollment or the conduct of clinical trials that we undertake. The outbreak and any preventative or protective actions that we, our customers, our respective manufacturers, suppliers or other third parties with which we have business relationships, or governments may take in respect of the coronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic could disrupt our business and the business of our customers or third parties with which we have business relationships. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business is difficult to predict and subject to change, and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including without limitation the severity of the disease and duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and social distancing requirements in the United States and other countries, future mutations and variations of the coronavirus, and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease and address its impact. In addition, a severe or prolonged economic downturn or political disruption could result in a variety of risks to our business, including our ability to raise capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy or political disruption could also strain our manufacturers or suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or cause our customers to delay making purchases or payments for our products. Any of the foregoing could harm our business. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant governmental measures being implemented to control the spread of the virus, including, at various times, quarantines, shelter-in-place or work-from-home orders or policies, travel restrictions, social distancing and business shutdowns. The effects of such measures could negatively impact productivity of our employees and disrupt our business activities, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and our ability to conduct business in the ordinary course. Although we have taken precautions intended to avoid the spread of the coronavirus among our employees, our operations could be adversely affected by outbreaks of COVID-19 among our employees. If we, our customers, or any of the third parties with whom we engage, including the suppliers, manufacturers, regulators and other third parties with whom we conduct business or have business relationships, were to experience shutdowns or other business disruptions, our ability to conduct our business in the manner presently anticipated could be materially and negatively impacted.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to obtain, or may experience delays in obtaining, regulatory approval, or may not be successful in commercializing our planned and future products.\nLike many companies our size, we do not have the ability to conduct preclinical or clinical studies for our product candidates without the assistance of third parties who conduct the studies on our behalf. These third parties are often toxicology facilities and clinical research organizations, or CROs, that have significant resources and experience in the conduct of pre-clinical and clinical studies. The toxicology facilities conduct the pre-clinical safety studies as well as associated tasks connected with these studies. The CROs typically perform patient recruitment, project management, data management, statistical analysis, and other reporting functions. We have relied on and intend to rely on third parties to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates and to use third party toxicology facilities and CROs for our pre-clinical and clinical studies. We may also rely on academic institutions or clinical research organizations to conduct, supervise or monitor some or all aspects of clinical trials involving our products.\nOur reliance on these third parties for development activities will reduce our control over these activities. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or for other reasons, we may be required to replace them, and our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated. Although we believe there are a number of third-party contractors that we could engage to continue these activities, replacing a third-party contractor may result in a delay of the affected trial.\nIf there are injuries or deaths associated with use of our products, or if there is a product recall affecting one or more of our products, we may be exposed to significant liabilities.\nThe production, manufacturing, labeling of pharmaceutical products and compounded pharmaceutical preparations is inherently risky. We could be adversely affected if any of our products, or the formulations or other products previously sold by USC, prove to be, or are asserted to be, harmful to patients. There are a number of factors that could result in the injury or death of a patient who receives one of our products or one of the compounded formulations previously sold by USC, including quality issues, manufacturing or labeling flaws, improper packaging or unanticipated or improper uses of the products, any of which could result from human or other error. Any of these situations could lead to a recall of, safety alert, or other proceedings or actions, relating to one or more of such products. On March 21, 2022, we announced a voluntary recall of four lots of SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection 0.15 mg (0.15 mg/0.3 mL) and 0.3 mg (0.3 mg/0.3 mL) Pre-Filled Single-Dose Syringes, due to the potential clogging of the needle preventing the dispensing of epinephrine. As of the date of this Report, neither USWM nor we have received, or is aware of, any adverse events related to this recall. However, if adverse events or deaths or a product recall, either voluntarily or as required by the FDA or a state board of pharmacy, were associated with our products, or one of the formulations or compounds previously sold by USC, we could become subject to product and professional liability lawsuits or other proceedings, including enforcement actions by state and federal authorities or other healthcare self-regulatory bodies or product liability claims or lawsuits. In addition, such matters could result in indemnification claims by third parties or claims relating to the product recall or associated expenses, including third parties that have purchased our SYMJEPI products or that may purchase our ZIMHI product, or to which we have sold certain assets of USC, including claims pursuant to our agreements with third parties. Any of the foregoing matters could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, included elsewhere in this Report, include and reflect a reserve of approximately $2.0 million associated with the SYMJEPI recall. The recall may have an adverse effect on the amount or the timing of our revenues, and on our financial results and liquidity, for fiscal quarters in 2022 or thereafter, although as of the date of this Report the amount of any such impact cannot be predicted with certainty. In addition, current or future insurance coverage may prove insufficient to cover any liability claims brought against USC or us.\nDelays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing of our product candidates could result in increased costs and delay our ability to generate significant revenues.\nThe actual timing of commencement and completion of clinical trials can vary substantially from our anticipated timing due to factors such as funding limitations, scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions, and the rate of patient enrollment. Clinical trials involving our product candidates may not commence or be completed as forecast. Delays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing could significantly impact our product development costs. We do not know whether current or planned clinical trials will begin on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. The commencement of clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in:\n\u25cf\nobtaining required funding;\n\u25cf\nobtaining regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial;\n\u25cf\nreaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations and clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf\nobtaining sufficient quantities of clinical trial materials for product candidates;\n\u25cf\nobtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site;\n\u25cf\nrecruiting participants for a clinical trial; and\n\u25cf\ndelays related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition, once a clinical trial has begun, it may be suspended or terminated by us or the FDA or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nfailure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf\ninspection of the clinical trial operations or clinical trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold;\n\u25cf\nfailure to achieve certain efficacy and/or safety standards; or\n\u25cf\nlack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nClinical trials require sufficient participant enrollment, which is a function of many factors, including the size of the target patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the proximity of participants to clinical trial sites, the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease, the eligibility criteria for our clinical trials and competing trials. Delays in enrollment can result in increased costs and longer development times. Our failure to enroll participants in our clinical trials could delay the completion of the clinical trials beyond current expectations. In addition, the FDA could require us to conduct clinical trials with a larger number of participants than we may project for any of our product candidates. As a result of these factors, we may not be able to enroll a sufficient number of participants in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nFurthermore, enrolled participants may drop out of clinical trials, which could impair the validity or statistical significance of the clinical trials. A number of factors can influence the discontinuation rate, including, but not limited to: the inclusion of a placebo in a trial; possible lack of effect of the product candidate being tested at one or more of the dose levels being tested; adverse side effects experienced, whether or not related to the product candidate; and the availability of numerous alternative treatment options that may induce participants to withdraw from the trial.\nWe may be required to suspend, repeat or terminate our clinical trials if the trials are not well designed, do not meet regulatory requirements or the results are negative or inconclusive, which may result in significant negative repercussions on business and financial condition.\nBefore regulatory approval for a potential product can be obtained, we must undertake clinical testing on humans to demonstrate the tolerability and efficacy of the product. We cannot assure you that we will obtain authorization to permit product candidates that are in the preclinical development phase to enter the human clinical testing phase. In addition, we cannot assure you that any authorized preclinical or clinical testing will be completed successfully within any specified time period by us, or without significant additional resources or expertise to those originally expected to be necessary. We cannot assure you that such testing will show potential products to be safe and efficacious or that any such product will be approved for a specific indication. Further, the results from preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be indicative of the results that will be obtained in later-stage clinical trials. In addition, we or regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials at any time on the basis that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks.\nWe are subject to the risk of clinical trial and product liability lawsuits.\nThe testing of human health care product candidates entails an inherent risk of allegations of clinical trial liability, while the marketing and sale of approved products entails an inherent risk of allegations of product liability and associated adverse publicity. We currently maintain liability insurance. However, such insurance policies are expensive, may not provide sufficient coverage, and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. As we conduct additional clinical trials and introduce products into the United States market, the risk of adverse events increases and our requirements for liability insurance coverage are likely to increase. We are subject to the risk that substantial liability claims from the testing or marketing of pharmaceutical products could be asserted against us in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain insurance on acceptable terms, particularly in overseas locations, for clinical and commercial activities or that any insurance obtained will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. An inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage on reasonable terms or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could inhibit our business.\nMoreover, our current and future coverages may not be adequate to protect us from all of the liabilities that we may incur. If losses from liability claims exceed our insurance coverage, we may incur substantial liabilities that exceed our financial resources. In addition, a product or clinical trial liability action against us would be expensive and time-consuming to defend, even if we ultimately prevailed. If we are required to pay a claim, we may not have sufficient financial resources and our business and results of operations may be harmed. A product liability claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage, if any, could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not have commercial-scale manufacturing capability, and we lack commercial manufacturing experience. We will likely rely on third parties to manufacture and supply our product candidates for which we will be seeking FDA approval.\nExcept for our facilities at USC that were previously utilized to prepare compounded formulations, we do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for clinical or commercial production of pharmaceutical products and product candidates, we do not have any experience in drug formulation or manufacturing, and we lack the resources and the capability to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. Accordingly, we expect to depend on third-party contract manufacturers for the foreseeable future. Any performance failure on the part of our contract manufacturers could delay clinical development, regulatory approval or commercialization of our current or future product candidates, depriving us of potential product revenue and resulting in additional losses. Any manufacturing problem or the loss of a contract manufacturer could be disruptive to our operations and result in lost sales. Additionally, we rely on third parties to supply the raw materials needed to manufacture our existing and potential products. Any business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, adverse public health developments such as the outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires, could adversely affect our supply chain. These risks and uncertainties are compounded in the presence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Any reliance on suppliers may involve several risks, including a potential inability to obtain critical materials and reduced control over production costs, delivery schedules, reliability and quality. Any unanticipated disruption to our manufacturers or suppliers could delay shipment of any of our products, increase our cost of goods sold and result in lost sales.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up initial production.\nThese problems can include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control (including stability of the product candidate and quality assurance testing), shortages of qualified personnel, and compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. If our third-party contract manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties or otherwise fail to comply with their obligations or under applicable regulations, our ability to provide product candidates to patients in our clinical trials or commercially would be jeopardized. If we file an application for marketing approval of the product and the FDA grants marketing approval, any delay or interruption in the supply of product could delay the commercial launch of the product or impair our ability to meet demand for the product. Difficulties in supplying products for clinical trials could increase the costs associated with our clinical trial programs and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new trials or qualify new manufacturers at significant additional expense, possibly causing commercial delays or termination of the trials.\nOur products can only be manufactured in a facility that has undergone a satisfactory inspection by the FDA and other relevant regulatory authorities. For these reasons, we may not be able to replace manufacturing capacity for our products quickly if we or our contract manufacturer(s) were unable to use manufacturing facilities as a result of a fire, natural disaster (including an earthquake), equipment failure, or other difficulty, or if such facilities were deemed not in compliance with the regulatory requirements and such non-compliance could not be rapidly rectified. An inability or reduced capacity to manufacture our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to substantial government regulation, which could materially adversely affect our business. If we do not receive regulatory approvals, we may not be able to develop and commercialize our technologies.\nWe need FDA approval to market our products in the United States that are subject to regulatory approval, and similar approvals from foreign regulatory authorities to market products outside the United States. The production and marketing of such products and potential products and our ongoing research and development, pre-clinical testing and clinical trial activities are subject to extensive regulation and review by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and will face similar regulation and review for overseas approval and sales from governmental authorities outside of the United States. The regulatory review and approval process, which may include evaluation of preclinical studies and clinical trials of our products that are subject to regulatory review, as well as the evaluation of manufacturing processes and contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities, is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. We have limited experience in filing and pursuing applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals. Many of the product candidates that we are currently developing must undergo rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing and an extensive regulatory approval process before they can be marketed. This process makes it longer, more difficult and more costly to bring our potential products to market, and we cannot guarantee that any of our potential products will be approved. Many products for which FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved for marketing. In addition to testing and approval procedures, extensive regulations also govern marketing, manufacturing, distribution, labeling, and record-keeping procedures. If we or our collaboration partners do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, such violations could result in non-approval, suspensions of regulatory approvals, civil penalties and criminal fines, product seizures and recalls, operating restrictions, injunctions, and criminal prosecution.\nRegulatory authorities generally have substantial discretion in the approval process and may either refuse to accept an application, or may decide after review of an application that the data submitted is insufficient to allow approval of the proposed product, as we have experienced with previous CRLs that we have received from the FDA. If regulatory authorities do not accept or approve our applications, they may require that we conduct additional clinical, preclinical or manufacturing studies and submit that data before regulatory authorities will reconsider such application. We may need to expend substantial resources to conduct further studies to obtain data that regulatory authorities believe is sufficient. Depending on the extent of these studies, acceptance or approval of applications may be delayed by several years, or may require us to expend more resources than we may have available. It is also possible that additional studies may not suffice to make applications approvable. If any of these outcomes occur, we may be forced to abandon our applications for approval.\nFailure to obtain FDA or other required regulatory approvals, or withdrawal of previous approvals, would adversely affect our business. Even if regulatory approval of a product is granted, this approval may entail limitations on uses for which the product may be labeled and promoted, or may prevent us from broadening the uses of products for different applications.\nFollowing regulatory approval of any of our drug candidates, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and restrictions, which may result in significant expense and limit our ability to commercialize our potential products.\nWith regard to our drug candidates that are approved by the FDA or by another regulatory authority, we are held to extensive regulatory requirements over product manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and record keeping. Regulatory approvals may also be subject to significant limitations on the indicated uses or marketing of the drug candidates. Potentially costly follow-up or post-marketing clinical studies may be required as a condition of approval to further substantiate safety or efficacy, or to investigate specific issues of interest to the regulatory authority. Previously unknown problems with the drug candidate, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, may result in restrictions on the marketing of the drug, and could include withdrawal of the drug from the market. In addition, the law or regulatory policies governing pharmaceuticals may change. New statutory requirements may be enacted or additional regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our drug candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or elsewhere. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we might not be permitted to market our drugs and our business could suffer.\nWe intend to pursue Section 505(b)(2) regulatory approval filings with the FDA for our products where applicable. Such filings involve significant costs, and we may also encounter difficulties or delays in obtaining regulatory approval for our products. Similar difficulties or delays may also arise in connection with any Abbreviated New Drug Applications that we may file.\nWe submitted a Section 505(b)(2) NDA regulatory filing to the FDA in connection with our approved SYMJEPI products and our ZIMHI (naloxone) Injection product, and we may pursue Section 505(b)(2) NDA filings with the FDA in connection with one or more other product candidates. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA is a special type of NDA that enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA\u2019s findings of safety and efficacy of an existing previously approved product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Such filings involve significant filing costs, including filing fees.\nTo the extent that a Section 505(b)(2) NDA relies on published literature relating to a previously approved drug product or the FDA\u2019s prior findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved drug product, where the underlying studies were not conducted by or for the applicant and the applicant lacks a right of reference or use to the underlying data, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant must submit in its Section 505(b)(2) application a patent certification or statement with respect to any patents that are subject to the Orange Book listing requirement in connection with the previously approved product on which the applicant\u2019s application relies. Specifically, the applicant must certify for each such patent that, in relevant part, (1) the required patent information has not been filed; (2) the patent has expired; (3) the patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is not sought until after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the proposed new product. Alternatively, with respect to a method of use patent, the applicant may submit a statement that the patent does not claim a use for which the applicant is seeking approval. A certification that the new product will not infringe the previously approved product\u2019s listed patent or that such patent is invalid or unenforceable is known as a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents through a Paragraph IV certification or submit a statement that a method of use patent does not claim a use for which the applicant is seeking approval, the FDA will not approve the Section 505(b)(2) NDA application until all the listed patents for the previously approved product have expired. Further, the FDA will also not approve a Section 505(b)(2) NDA until any applicable non-patent exclusivity, such as, for example, five-year exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, three-year exclusivity for an approval based on new clinical trials, or pediatric exclusivity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product, has expired.\nIf the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the owner of the referenced NDA for the previously approved product and relevant patent holders within 20 days after the FDA sends the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant notice that the Section 505(b)(2) NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement suit against the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. Under the FDCA, the filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of receipt of the notification regarding a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for 30 months beginning on the date the patent holder receives notice, unless, before the end of the 30-month period, a court determines that the patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed; a court enters a settlement order or consent decree stating that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed; the patent owner or exclusive licensee consents to approval of the Section 505(b)(2) NDA; or the court enters an order of dismissal without a finding of infringement.\nIf we rely in our Section 505(b)(2) regulatory filings on published literature relating to a previously approved drug product or the FDA\u2019s prior findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved drug product where the underlying studies were not conducted by or for us and we lack a right of reference or use to the underlying data, and that involves patents referenced in the Orange Book, then we will need to make the patent certifications or the Paragraph IV certification described above. If we make a Paragraph IV certification and the holder of the previously approved product that we referenced in our application initiates patent litigation within the time periods described above, then any FDA approval of our 505(b)(2) application would be delayed until the earlier of 30 months, resolution of the lawsuit, or the other events described above. Accordingly, our anticipated dates relating to review and approval of a product that was subject to such litigation would be delayed. In addition, we would incur the expenses, which could be material, involved with any such patent litigation. As a result, we may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of our product only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before our product may be commercialized, if at all.\nIn addition, even if we submit a Section 505(b)(2) application, such as we may submit for other future products, that relies on published literature relating to a previously approved drug product or the FDA\u2019s prior findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved drug product where there are no patents referenced in the Orange Book for such other product with respect to which we have to provide certifications, we are subject to the risk that the FDA could disagree with our reliance on the particular previously approved product that we chose to rely on, conclude that such previously approved product is not an acceptable reference product, and require us instead to rely as a reference product on another previously approved product that involves patents referenced in the Orange Book, requiring us to make the certifications described above and subjecting us to additional delay, expense and the other risks described above.\nSimilarly, if we submit one or more ANDA applications to the FDA pursuant to Section 505(j) of the FDCA in connection with one or more of our product candidates, we could encounter generally similar difficulties or delays, including difficulties or delays resulting from the Paragraph IV certification process or from the development of any bioequivalence or other data that might be required in connection with any such ANDAs.\nIf we fail to obtain acceptable prices or appropriate reimbursement for our products, our ability to successfully commercialize our products will be impaired.\nGovernment and insurance reimbursements for healthcare expenditures play an important role for all healthcare providers, including physicians and pharmaceutical companies such as Adamis, that plan to offer various products in the United States and other countries in the future. Physicians and patients may decide not to order our products unless third-party payors, such as managed care organizations as well as government payors such as Medicare and Medicaid, pay a substantial portion of the price of the products. Market acceptance and sales of our specialty pharmaceutical products and potential products will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of such products will be available from government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers, managed care organizations, and other organizations. In the United States, our ability to have our products eligible for Medicare, Medicaid or private insurance reimbursement will be an important factor in determining the ultimate success of our products. If, for any reason, Medicare, Medicaid or the insurance companies decline to provide reimbursement for our products, our ability to commercialize our products would be adversely affected.\nThird-party payors may challenge the price of medical and pharmaceutical products. Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend on a number of factors, including a payor\u2019s determination that our product candidates are:\n\u25cf\nnot experimental or investigational;\n\u25cf\neffective;\n\u25cf\nmedically necessary;\n\u25cf\nappropriate for the specific patient;\n\u25cf\ncost-effective;\n\u25cf\nsupported by peer-reviewed publications; or\n\u25cf\nincluded in clinical practice guidelines.\nIf purchasers or users of our products and related treatments are not able to obtain appropriate reimbursement for the cost of using such products, they may forego or reduce such use. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved pharmaceutical products, and there can be no assurance that adequate third-party coverage will be available for any of our products. Even if our products are approved for reimbursement by Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers, of which there can be no assurance, the amount of reimbursement may be reduced at times or even eliminated, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLegislative or regulatory reform of the healthcare system may affect our ability to sell our products profitably.\nIn both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been and are expected to be a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system in ways that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. The impact of these changes on the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries and our business is uncertain. The U.S. Congress continues to consider issues relating to the healthcare system, and future legislation or regulations may affect our ability to market and sell products on favorable terms, which would affect our results of operations, as well as our ability to raise capital, obtain additional collaborators or profitably market our products. Such legislation or regulation may reduce our revenues, increase our expenses or limit the markets for our products. In particular, we expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our products due to the influence of health maintenance and managed health care organizations and additional legislative proposals.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the general healthcare industry, which are subject to frequent change.\nParticipants in the healthcare industry, including the company and, before the winding down of its business as described elsewhere in this Report, USC, are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Laws and regulations in the healthcare industry are extremely complex and, in many instances, industry participants do not have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation. Such laws and regulations are subject to change and often are uncertain in their application. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to scrutiny or challenge under one or more of these laws or regulations or that any such challenge would not be successful. Any such challenge, whether or not successful, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, we are subject to the federal anti-kickback statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for referring an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, or purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program. We are also subject to state anti-kickback laws and regulations. Violations of the anti-kickback statutes can result in imprisonment, civil or criminal fines, and fines and disciplinary actions relating to our state licensure. Any violation or alleged violation of such federal or state laws could harm our reputation, customer relationships or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have limited sales, marketing and distribution experience.\nWe have limited experience in the sales, marketing, and distribution of pharmaceutical products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to establish sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities or make arrangements with collaborators or others to perform such activities or that such efforts will be successful. If we decide to market any products directly ourselves, we would be required to either acquire or internally develop a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution capabilities. The acquisition or development of a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure would require substantial resources, which may not be available to us or, even if available, could divert the attention of our management and key personnel and have a negative impact on further product development efforts.\nWe may seek to enter into arrangements to develop and commercialize our products. These collaborations, even if secured, may not be successful.\nWe have entered and sought to enter into arrangements with third parties regarding development or commercialization of some of our products or product candidates and may in the future seek to enter into collaborative arrangements to develop and commercialize some of our potential products both in North America and international markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate commercialization or collaborative arrangements on favorable terms or at all or that our current or future collaborative arrangements will be successful. The amount and timing of resources such third parties will devote to these activities may not be within our control. There can be no assurance that such parties will perform their obligations as expected. There can be no assurance that our collaborators will devote adequate resources to our products.\nEven if they are approved and commercialized, if our potential products are unable to compete effectively with current and future products targeting similar markets as our potential products, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated.\nThe markets for our SYMJEPI products and ZIMHI product, and our other product candidates, are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological progress. We face competition from numerous sources, including major biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies worldwide. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources, and development, production and marketing capabilities, than we do. Our SYMJEPI product competes with a number of other currently marketed epinephrine products for use in the emergency treatment of acute allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Our ZIMHI product competes with a number of other currently marketed products utilizing naloxone, for the treatment of acute opioid overdose. Our Tempol product candidate for use in treatment of COVID-19, if successfully developed, approved and commercialized, will compete with a number of other current and future products and therapies for use in the treatment of COVID-19. Certain companies have established technologies that may be competitive with our product candidates and any future products that we may develop or acquire. Some of these products may use different approaches or means to obtain results, which could be more effective or less expensive than our products for similar indications. In addition, many of these companies have more experience than we do in pre-clinical testing, performance of clinical trials, manufacturing, and obtaining FDA and foreign regulatory approvals. They may also have more brand name exposure and expertise in sales and marketing. We also compete with academic institutions, governmental agencies and private organizations that are conducting research in the same fields.\nCompetition among these entities to recruit and retain highly qualified scientific, technical and professional personnel and consultants is also intense. As a result, there is a risk that one or more of our competitors will develop a more effective product for the same indications for which we are developing a product or, alternatively, bring a similar product to market before we can do so. Failure to successfully compete will adversely impact the ability to raise additional capital and ultimately achieve profitable operations.\nOur product candidates may not gain acceptance among physicians, patients, or the medical community, thereby limiting our potential to generate revenue, which will undermine our future growth prospects.\nEven if our pharmaceutical product candidates are approved for commercial sale by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the degree of market acceptance of any approved product candidate by physicians, health care professionals and third-party payors, and our profitability and growth will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe ability to provide acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy;\n\u25cf\npricing and cost effectiveness, which may be subject to regulatory control;\n\u25cf\nour ability to obtain sufficient third-party insurance coverage or reimbursement;\n\u25cf\neffectiveness of our or our collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategy;\n\u25cf\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u25cf\nthe prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects; and\n\u25cf\navailability of alternative treatments.\nIf any product candidate that we develop does not provide a treatment regimen that is at least as beneficial as the current standard of care or otherwise does not provide some additional patient benefit over the current standard of care, that product will likely not achieve market acceptance and we will not generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability.\nIf we suffer negative publicity concerning the safety of our products in development, our sales may be harmed and we may be forced to withdraw such products.\nIf concerns should arise about the safety of any of our products that are marketed, regardless of whether or not such concerns have a basis in generally accepted science or peer-reviewed scientific research, such concerns could adversely affect the market for these products. Similarly, negative publicity could result in an increased number of product liability claims, whether or not these claims are supported by applicable law.\nOur failure to adequately protect or to enforce our intellectual property rights or secure rights to third party patents could materially harm our proprietary position in the marketplace or prevent the commercialization of our products.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain protection in the United States and other countries for the intellectual property covering or incorporated into our technologies and products. The patents and patent applications in our existing patent portfolio are either owned by us or licensed to us. Our ability to protect our product candidates from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties depends substantially on our ability to obtain and maintain, or license, valid and enforceable patents. Due to evolving legal standards relating to the patentability, validity and enforceability of patents covering pharmaceutical inventions and the scope of claims made under these patents, our ability to obtain and enforce patents is uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles are unresolved.\nThere is a substantial backlog of patent applications at the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO. There can be no assurance that any patent applications relating to our products or methods will be issued as patents, or, if issued, that the patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide a competitive advantage. We may not be able to obtain patent rights on products, treatment methods or manufacturing processes that we may develop or to which we may obtain license or other rights. Even if we do obtain or license patent rights, rights under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection for our product candidates or provide sufficient protection to afford us a commercial advantage against our competitors or their competitive products or processes. Patents and intellectual property that we own or license may not afford us the rights that we anticipate. It is possible that no patents will be issued from any pending or future patent applications owned by us or licensed to us. Others may challenge, seek to invalidate, infringe or circumvent any patents we own or license. Alternatively, we may in the future be required to initiate litigation against third parties to enforce our intellectual property rights. The defense and prosecution of patent and intellectual property claims are both costly and time consuming, even if the outcome is favorable to us. Any adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to license disputed rights from others, or require us to cease selling our future products.\nIn addition, many other organizations are engaged in research and product development efforts that may overlap with our products. Such organizations may currently have, or may obtain in the future, legally blocking proprietary rights, including patent rights, in one or more products or methods under development or consideration by us. These rights may prevent us from commercializing technology, or may require us to obtain a license from the organizations to use the technology. We may not be able to obtain any such licenses that may be required on reasonable financial terms, if at all, and we cannot be sure that the patents underlying any such licenses will be valid or enforceable. As with other companies in the pharmaceutical industry, we are subject to the risk that persons located in other countries will engage in development, marketing or sales activities of products that would infringe our patent rights if such activities were conducted in the United States.\nOur patents also may not afford protection against competitors with similar technology. We may not have identified all patents, published applications or published literature that affect our business either by blocking our ability to commercialize our product candidates, by preventing the patentability of our products or by covering the same or similar technologies that may affect our ability to market or license our product candidates. Many companies have encountered difficulties in protecting and defending their intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. If we encounter such difficulties or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting our intellectual property rights in either the United States or foreign jurisdictions, our business prospects could be substantially harmed. In addition, we may not have adequate cash funding to devote the resources that might be necessary to prepare or pursue patent applications, either at all or in all jurisdictions in which we might desire to obtain patents, or to maintain already-issued patents.\nWe may become involved in patent litigation or other intellectual property proceedings relating to our future product approvals, which could result in liability for damages or delay or stop our development and commercialization efforts.\nThe pharmaceutical industry has been characterized by significant litigation and other proceedings regarding patents, patent applications, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights. The situations in which we may become parties to such litigation or proceedings may include any third parties initiating litigation claiming that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights, or that one of our trademarks or trade names infringes the third party\u2019s trademark rights; in such case, we will need to defend against such proceedings. For example, the field of generic pharmaceuticals is characterized by frequent litigation that occurs in connection with the regulatory filings under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA and attempts to invalidate the patent of the reference drug.\nThe costs of resolving any patent litigation or other intellectual property proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Many of our potential competitors will be able to sustain the cost of such litigation and proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other intellectual property proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Patent litigation and other intellectual property proceedings may also consume significant management time.\nIn the event that a competitor infringes upon our patent or other intellectual property rights, enforcing those rights may be costly, difficult, and time-consuming. Even if successful, litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against challenge could be expensive and time-consuming and could divert our management\u2019s attention. We may not have sufficient resources to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patent or other intellectual property rights against a challenge. If we are unsuccessful in enforcing and protecting our intellectual property rights and protecting our products, it could materially harm our business.\nIf we determine that our intangible assets have become impaired in the future, our total assets and earnings could be adversely affected.\nGoodwill represents the purchase price of acquisitions in excess of the amounts assigned to acquired tangible or intangible assets and assumed liabilities. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but rather are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently, if indicators of impairment exist. Finite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If the impairment evaluations for goodwill and intangible assets indicate the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. During and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, we recorded significant impairment charges for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. If in the future we determine that our intangible assets have become impaired, our total assets, financial results, and earnings could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to certain data privacy and security requirements, which are very complex and difficult to comply with at times. Any failure to ensure adherence to these requirements could subject us to fines and penalties, and damage our reputation.\nWe are required to comply, as applicable, with numerous federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, which govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. Other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information. In addition, most healthcare providers who may prescribe products we may sell in the future and from whom we may obtain patient health information are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA and comparable state laws. These laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business, and any failure to comply could result in harm to our reputation, and potentially fines and penalties.\nThere are significant limitations on our ability in the future to utilize any net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, and credit carryforwards which, subject to certain limitations, we may use to reduce future taxable income or offset income taxes due. Insufficient future taxable income will adversely affect our ability to utilize these NOLs and credit carryforwards. Pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 382, the annual use of the NOLs and research and development tax credits could be limited by any greater than 50% ownership change during any three-year testing period. As noted in Note 20 of the audited consolidated financial statements appearing in this Report, our existing NOLs are subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, and if we undergo additional ownership changes, our ability to use our NOLs could be further limited by Section 382 of the Code. As a result of these limitations, we may be materially limited in our ability to utilize our NOLs and credit carryforward.\nRisks Related to Our Former Compounding Pharmacy Business\nWe have sold a substantial portion of the assets of USC and are winding down the remaining business of USC and selling or otherwise disposing of the remaining assets of USC. There is no assurance regarding the proceeds that we may receive from the sale or disposition of any assets of USC. We may incur significant costs in connection with such winding down activities.\nAs previously disclosed in our reports with the SEC and as disclosed elsewhere in this Report, pursuant to the USC Agreement we have sold and transferred certain assets relating to the human compounding pharmaceutical business of USC and have agreed to a variety of restrictive covenants preventing us from engaging in certain business and competitive activities relating to the human compounding pharmaceutical business. The remaining operations and business of USC have been or will be wound down and terminated, and remaining assets relating to USC\u2019s business have been sold or will be sold or otherwise transferred or disposed of. Effective October 31, 2021, USC surrendered its Arkansas retail pharmacy permit and wholesaler/outsourcer permit and is no longer engaged in the human or veterinary compounding pharmaceutical business. The USC Agreement provides for payment of consideration over time based on future sales of products by the Purchaser. The ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors, could adversely affect the amount that we receive in the future pursuant to the USC Agreement or other agreements or activities relating to the sale or disposition of USC\u2019s assets. There is no assurance regarding the amount of proceeds that we may receive from the Purchase Agreement or any other sale or disposition of any other assets of USC.\nWe have indemnification obligations under the USC Agreement, and we may have indemnification obligations under other agreements relating to the sale or disposition of other USC assets, pursuant to which we may be required to indemnify, hold harmless, and pay losses, liabilities, expenses and amounts arising out of certain claims relating to the assets that are the subject of such agreements, including without limitation relating to, among other matters, our breach of the USC Agreement or other applicable agreement, third party claims relating to previous sales of products by USC to customers, or other matters. These indemnification provisions could require us to pay significant amounts to satisfy our indemnification obligations under such agreements, which would reduce the net amounts that we ultimately receive from the sale of the assets subject to such agreements.\nIn addition, other matters may arise in the future relating to the USC business, USC assets, or USC employees, or arising out of the restructuring, winding down and winding up activities, that could require us to pay amounts in the future. The process of winding down and winding up the remaining business of USC could require us to incur significant expenses or pay significant amounts in connection with or relating to the termination of employment of USC\u2019s employees, the disposition of remaining USC assets, the termination of agreements relating to the USC business, or the resolution of outstanding obligations, liabilities, or current or future claims or proceedings. In addition, we could be required to pay significant fines, penalties or other amounts as a result of proceedings by federal or state regulatory authorities relating to the business and operations of USC.\nThe compounding pharmaceuticals business formerly conducted by USC is significantly impacted by state and federal statutes and regulations.\nThe compounding pharmaceuticals business formerly conducted by USC is subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations, and administrative practices, including, among others: federal registration as an outsourcing facility, state and local licensure and registration requirements concerning the operation of outsourcing facilities, and federal and state laws relating to the preparation, purchase, sale, advertisement, promotion, distribution, management, compounding, dispensing, reimbursement, marketing, and labeling of drugs that USC sells and related services as well as state pharmacy, manufacturer, wholesaler and distribution licensure and registration or permit standards; HIPAA and other laws relating to the use, disclosure and transmission of health or other personal information; the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010; statutes and regulations of the FDA and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, and states including relating to controlled substances; and state pharmacy, manufacturer, wholesaler and distribution licensure and registration or permit standards and other state laws and regulations.\nThe federal, state and local laws and regulations applicable to the pharmaceutical and compounding industries are subject to frequent change, whether through change in law or through interpretation. There can be no assurance that we or USC have been or are compliant in material respects with applicable federal and state regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with FDA requirements and other federal or state governmental laws and regulations can result in fines, disgorgement, unanticipated compliance expenditures, recall or seizure of products, exposure to product liability claims, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, enforcement actions, injunctions and civil or criminal prosecution, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nProvisions of our charter documents could discourage an acquisition of our company that would benefit our stockholders and may have the effect of entrenching, and making it difficult to remove, management.\nProvisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would benefit our stockholders. For example, shares of our preferred stock may be issued in the future without further stockholder approval, and upon such terms and conditions, and having such rights, privileges and preferences, as our board of directors may determine, including, for example, rights to convert into our common stock. The rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any of our preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of our preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us. This could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and discourage those investors from acquiring a majority of our common stock. Similarly, our bylaws require that any stockholder proposals or nominations for election to our board of directors must meet specific advance notice requirements and procedures, which make it more difficult for our stockholders to make proposals or director nominations. The existence of these charter provisions could have the effect of entrenching management and making it more difficult to change our management. Furthermore, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit or restrict large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us, unless one or more exemptions from such provisions apply. These provisions under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts and could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially. For example, from January 2019 to December 31, 2021, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated between $0.27 and $3.29. Market prices for securities of early-stage pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences companies have historically been particularly volatile. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u25cf\nrelatively low trading volume, which can result in significant volatility in the market price of our common stock based on a relatively smaller number of trades and dollar amount of transactions;\n\u25cf\nthe timing and results of our current and any future preclinical or clinical trials of our product candidates;\n\u25cf\nthe entry into or termination of key agreements, including, among others, key collaboration and license agreements;\n\u25cf\nthe results and timing of regulatory reviews relating to the approval of our product candidates;\n\u25cf\nthe timing of, or delay in the timing of, commercial introduction of any of our products;\n\u25cf\nthe initiation of, material developments in, or conclusion of, litigation to enforce or defend any of our intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf\nfailure of any of our product candidates, if approved, to achieve commercial success;\n\u25cf\ngeneral and industry-specific economic conditions that may affect our research and development expenditures;\n\u25cf\nthe results of clinical trials conducted by others on products that would compete with our product candidates;\n\u25cf\nissues in manufacturing our product candidates or any approved products;\n\u25cf\nthe loss of key employees;\n\u25cf\nthe introduction of technological innovations or new commercial products by our competitors;\n\u25cf\nchanges in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if any, who cover our common stock;\n\u25cf\nfuture sales of our common stock;\n\u25cf\npublicity or announcements regarding regulatory developments relating to our products;\n\u25cf\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in our financial results, including our cash and cash equivalents balance, operating expenses, cash burn rate or revenue levels;\n\u25cf\ncommon stock sales in the public market by one or more of our larger stockholders, officers or directors;\n\u25cf\nour filing for protection under federal bankruptcy laws;\n\u25cf\na negative outcome in any litigation or potential legal proceeding;\n\u25cf\neffects of public health crises, pandemics and epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak; or\n\u25cf\nother potentially negative financial announcements, such as a review of any of our filings by the SEC, changes in accounting treatment or restatement of previously reported financial results or delays in our filings with the SEC.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation.\nTrading of our common stock is limited.\nTrading of our common stock is limited, and trading restrictions imposed on us by applicable regulations may further reduce our trading, making it difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares.\nThe foregoing factors may result in lower prices for our common stock than might otherwise be obtained and could also result in a larger spread between the bid and asked prices for our common stock. In addition, without a large public float, our common stock is less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership, and as a result, the trading price of our common stock may be more volatile. In the absence of an active public trading market, an investor may be unable to liquidate his or her investment in our common stock. Trading of a relatively small volume of our common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price of our stock than would be the case if our public float were larger. We cannot predict the price at which our common stock will trade at any given time.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq could result in a delisting of our common stock, which could negatively impact the market price and liquidity of our common shares and our ability to access the capital markets.\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. If we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our common stock. Such a delisting would have a negative effect on the price of our common stock, impair the ability to sell or purchase our common stock when persons wish to do so, and any delisting materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital or pursue strategic restructuring, refinancing or other transactions on acceptable terms, or at all. Delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities. In the event of a delisting, we would attempt to take actions to restore our compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements.\nOn December 31, 2021, we received a notice from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department of The NASDAQ Capital Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) informing us that because the closing bid price of our common stock had been below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days, we no longer complied with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \u201cRule\u201d) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, and Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. The notice had no immediate effect on the listing or the trading of our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Pursuant to Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the notice letter stated that we had an initial compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until June 29, 2022, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock must meet or exceed $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days during the 180 calendar day grace period. If at any time before June 29, 2022, the bid price of our common stock closes at or above $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide written notification that we have achieved compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, and the matter would be resolved. The notice letter also disclosed that if we do not regain compliance within the initial compliance period, we may be eligible for an additional 180-day compliance period. To qualify for additional time, we would be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and would need to provide written notice of a plan to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period, including by effecting a reverse stock split if necessary. If the company meets these requirements, Nasdaq would inform us that we have been granted an additional 180 calendar days to regain compliance. However, if it appears to the staff of Nasdaq that we will not be able to cure the deficiency, or if we are otherwise not eligible, the staff would notify us that we will not be granted additional 180 days for compliance and will be subject to delisting at that time. In the event of such notification, we may appeal the staff\u2019s determination to delist its securities, but there can be no assurance that any such appeal would be successful. We intend to monitor the closing bid price for our common stock and will consider available strategies in an effort to satisfy the minimum bid price requirement. However, there are no assurances that we will be able to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirements or will otherwise be in compliance with other Nasdaq listing rules. In addition, at various times from October 2019 through September 2020, we received similar notices from Nasdaq regarding the minimum bid price requirement of Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), and on each such occasion, following such notice we have regained compliance with the Rule.\nOn May 25, 2021, we received a notification letter from Nasdaq notifying us that, because the company has not yet filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2021, the company was no longer in compliance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires timely filing of periodic reports with the SEC. The Notice also indicated that the company had 60 calendar days to submit a plan to regain compliance and, if Nasdaq accepts the plan, Nasdaq can grant an exception of up to 180 calendar days from the Filing\u2019s due date to regain compliance. We submitted a plan to regain compliance on July 26, 2021. On August 20, 2021, we received a notification letter from Nasdaq notifying us that because we had not filed our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2021, as well as its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2021, we did not comply with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5250(c)(1). Nasdaq subsequently requested that we submit an updated plan to regain compliance, which we submitted, and Nasdaq granted an exception of up to November 22, 2021, to regain compliance and file all Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Qs required to be filed before that date. We filed the Form 10-Qs before the specified date and regained compliance with the applicable Nasdaq listing requirements.\nOur common stock could become subject to additional trading restrictions as a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which could adversely affect the liquidity and price of such stock. If our common stock became subject to the SEC\u2019s penny stock rules, broker-dealers may experience difficulty in completing customer transactions and trading activity in our securities may be adversely affected.\nPrior to the listing of our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market, our common stock was traded on the OTCQB. The OTCQB, the OTC Bulletin Board and Pink Sheets are viewed by most investors as a less desirable, and less liquid, marketplace. As a result, if our common stock was delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market and was traded on the OTCQB, the OTC Bulletin Board or the Pink Sheets, an investor could find it more difficult to purchase, dispose of or obtain accurate quotations as to the value of our common stock.\nUnless our common stock is listed on a national securities exchange, such as the NASDAQ Capital Market, our common stock may also be subject to the regulations regarding trading in \u201cpenny stocks,\u201d which are those securities trading for less than $5.00 per share, and that are not otherwise exempted from the definition of a penny stock under other exemptions provided for in the applicable regulations. The following is a list of the general restrictions on the sale of penny stocks:\n\u25cf\nBefore the sale of penny stock by a broker-dealer to a new purchaser, the broker-dealer must determine whether the purchaser is suitable to invest in penny stocks. To make that determination, a broker-dealer must obtain, from a prospective investor, information regarding the purchaser\u2019s financial condition and investment experience and objectives. Subsequently, the broker-dealer must deliver to the purchaser a written statement setting forth the basis of the suitability finding and obtain the purchaser\u2019s signature on such statement.\n\u25cf\nA broker-dealer must obtain from the purchaser an agreement to purchase the securities. This agreement must be obtained for every purchase until the purchaser becomes an \u201cestablished customer.\u201d\n\u25cf\nThe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, requires that before effecting any transaction in any penny stock, a broker-dealer must provide the purchaser with a \u201crisk disclosure document\u201d that contains, among other things, a description of the penny stock market and how it functions, and the risks associated with such investment. These disclosure rules are applicable to both purchases and sales by investors.\n\u25cf\nA dealer that sells penny stock must send to the purchaser, within 10 days after the end of each calendar month, a written account statement including prescribed information relating to the security.\nThese requirements can severely limit the liquidity of securities in the secondary market because fewer brokers or dealers are likely to be willing to undertake these compliance activities. If our common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange, the rules and restrictions regarding penny stock transactions may limit an investor\u2019s ability to sell to a third party and our ability to raise additional capital. We make no guarantee that market-makers will make a market in our common stock, or that any market for our common stock will continue.\nOur stockholders may experience significant dilution as a result of any additional financing using our securities, or as the result of the exercise or conversion of our outstanding securities.\nIn the future, to the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into or exercisable for equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution. In addition, conversion or exercise of other outstanding options, warrants or convertible securities could result in there being a significant number of additional shares outstanding and dilution to our stockholders. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of preferred stock, holders of preferred stock could have rights that are senior to the rights of holders of our common stock, and the agreements relating to any such issuance could contain covenants that would restrict our operations.\nWe have not paid cash dividends on our common stock in the past and do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nNo cash dividends have been paid on our common stock, and we do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Payment of dividends would depend upon our profitability at the time, cash available for those dividends, and other factors as our board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on a stockholder investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.\nThe rights of the holders of common stock may be impaired by the potential issuance of preferred stock.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation gives our board of directors the right to create new series of preferred stock. As a result, the board of directors may, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting, dividend, conversion, liquidation or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power and equity interest of the holders of common stock. Preferred stock, which could be issued with the right to more than one vote per share, could be utilized as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control. The possible impact on takeover attempts could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the possibility that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf in the future we sell additional equity securities to help satisfy funding requirements, those securities may be subject to registration rights or may include warrants with anti-dilutive protective provisions. Future sales in the public market of our common stock, or shares issued upon exercise of our outstanding stock options, warrants or convertible securities, or the perception by the market that these issuances or sales could occur, could lower the market price of our common stock or make it difficult for us to raise additional capital. Our stockholders may experience substantial dilution and a reduction in the price that they are able to obtain upon the sale of their shares. Also, new equity securities issued may have greater rights, preferences or privileges than our existing common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 149,594,262 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, substantially all of which we believe may be sold publicly, subject in some cases to volume and other limitations, provisions or limitations in registration rights agreements, or prospectus-delivery or other requirements relating to the effectiveness and use of registration statements registering the resale of such shares.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had reserved for issuance 4,985,415 shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options under our equity incentive plans at a weighted-average exercise price of $4.21 per share, we had outstanding restricted stock units covering 1,039,003 shares of common stock, and we had outstanding warrants to purchase 14,202,824 shares of common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $1.17 per share. Subject to applicable vesting requirements, upon exercise of these options or warrants or issuance of shares following vesting of the restricted stock units, the underlying shares may be resold into the public market, subject in some cases to volume and other limitations or prospectus delivery requirements pursuant to registration statements registering the resale of such shares. In the case of outstanding options or warrants that have exercise prices that are below the market price of our common stock from time to time, or upon issuance of shares following vesting of restricted stock units, our stockholders would experience dilution upon the exercise of these options.\nExercise of our outstanding warrants may result in dilution to our stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding warrants, other than the warrants described in the next sentence, to purchase 58,824 shares of common stock, at a weighted average exercise price of $8.50 per share. As of December 31, 2021, 13,794,000 shares of our common stock were issuable (subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations) upon exercise of warrants, at an exercise price of $1.15 per share, that we issued in connection with our underwritten public offering of common stock and warrants in August 2019; 350,000 shares of our common stock were issuable (subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations) upon exercise of warrants, at an exercise price of $0.70 per share, that we issued in connection with our private placement of warrants in February 2020.\nOur Bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for a wide variety of disputes between us and our stockholders, and that the federal district courts of the United States of the America are the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. Exclusive forum provisions in our Bylaws could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur Bylaws, as amended, provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for most legal actions involving actions brought against us by stockholders, including (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the company; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the company to the company or the company\u2019s stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim against the company or any director or officer or other employee of the company arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the certificate of incorporation or the Bylaws of the company, or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction on the Courts of Chancery of the State of Delaware; or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the company or any director or officer or other employee of the company governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in all cases subject to the court\u2019s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants (including without limitation as a result of the consent of such indispensable party to the personal jurisdiction of such court). The Bylaws provide that the foregoing provisions do not apply to actions or suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Our Bylaws do not relieve us of our duties to comply with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations. In addition, our Bylaws, as amended, provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to these provisions.\nUnder the Securities Act, federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act. There is uncertainty as to whether a court (other than state courts in the State of Delaware, where the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware decided in March 2020 that exclusive forum provisions for causes of action arising under the Securities Act are facially valid under Delaware law) would enforce forum selection provisions and whether investors can waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. We believe the forum selection provisions in Bylaws, as amended, may benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law and federal securities laws by chancellors and judges, as applicable, particularly experienced in resolving corporate disputes, efficient administration of cases on a more expedited schedule relative to other forums and protection against the burdens of multi-forum litigation. However, these provisions may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against us and/or our directors, officers and employees as it may limit any stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholder finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees. In addition, stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies\u2019 charter documents has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with any applicable action brought against us, a future court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our Bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our Bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 related to disclosure controls and procedures, identify or discover material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or fail to effectively remediate any identified material weaknesses, our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected and our stock price could decline.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our management is likewise required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose any material changes and weaknesses identified through such evaluation. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. If we fail to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 related to disclosure controls and procedures, or, if we discover material weaknesses and other deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. If material weaknesses or significant deficiencies are discovered or if we otherwise fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly.\nAs disclosed in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the first three quarters of 2021, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of March 31, 2021, June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2021. We believe that the identified weakness was remediated as of December 31, 2021. Nevertheless, any failure to effectively remediate an identified material weakness or otherwise maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, and legal proceedings by stockholders or regulatory authorities, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business. We could face monetary judgments, penalties or other sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause our stock price to decline. Failure to timely file required reports with the SEC, as occurred with respect to our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the first three quarters of 2021, results in loss of eligibility to utilize short form registration statements on Form S-3 and prospectuses outstanding under previous registration statements not being current or available, which may impair our ability to obtain required capital in a timely manner or issue shares for other purposes, and may subject us to legal claims from stockholders or warrant holders. Inadequate internal control could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nWe take responsive actions to address identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. However, we can give no assurance that such measures will remediate any material weakness that are identified or that any additional material weaknesses or restatements of financial results will not arise in the future. In the future, our management may determine that our disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective or that there are one or more material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, resulting in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to the annual or interim financial statements would not have been prevented or detected. Accordingly, a material weakness increases the risk that the financial information we report contains material errors. Any system of internal controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Efforts to correct any material weaknesses or deficiencies that may be identified could require significant financial resources to address. Moreover, if remedial measures are insufficient to address the deficiencies that are determined to exist, we may fail to meet our future reporting obligations on a timely basis, our consolidated financial statements could contain material misstatements, we could be required to restate our prior period financial results, our operating results may be harmed, and we could become subject to class action litigation or investigations or proceedings from regulatory authorities. Any of these matters could adversely affect our business, reputation, revenues, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe depend on our officers. If we are unable to retain our key employees or to attract additional qualified personnel, our product operations and development efforts may be seriously jeopardized.\nOur success will be dependent upon the efforts of our management team and staff, including Dennis J. Carlo, Ph.D., our chief executive officer. The employment of Dr. Carlo may be terminated at any time by either us or Dr. Carlo. We currently do not have key person life insurance policies covering any of our executive officers or key employees. If key individuals leave us, we could be adversely affected if suitable replacement personnel are not quickly recruited. There is competition for qualified personnel in all functional areas, which makes it difficult to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the operation of our business. Our success also depends in part on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, commercial and administrative personnel. If we are unable to attract new employees and retain existing key employees, the development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed or negatively impacted. In addition, any staffing interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, adverse public health developments such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may experience difficulties in managing growth.\nWe are a small company. Any significant growth in the future could impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, attract, retain, motivate and integrate highly skilled personnel. Our future financial performance and our ability to compete effectively may depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to:\n\u25cf\nmanage our clinical studies effectively;\n\u25cf\nintegrate additional management, administrative, manufacturing and regulatory personnel;\n\u25cf\nmaintain sufficient administrative, accounting and management information systems and controls; and\n\u25cf\nhire and train additional qualified personnel.\nWe may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could harm our financial results.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of cybersecurity or other system failures. Our business depends on complex information systems, and any failure to successfully maintain these systems or implement new systems to handle our changing needs could materially harm our operations.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of employees. Similarly, our third-party providers possess certain of our sensitive data. The secure maintenance of this information is material to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business, including recently enacted laws in a majority of states requiring security breach notification. Thus, any access, disclosure or other loss of information, including our data being breached at our partners or third-party providers, could result in legal claims or proceedings and liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation which could adversely affect our business.\nA sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline and may impair our ability to raise capital in the future.\nThere have been and may continue to be periods when our common stock could be considered \u201cthinly-traded,\u201d meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common stock at or near bid prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. Finance transactions resulting in a large amount of newly issued shares that become readily tradable, conversion of outstanding convertible notes or exercise of outstanding warrants and sale of the shares issuable upon conversion of such notes or exercise of such warrants, issuance of shares following vesting of outstanding restricted stock units, or other events that cause stockholders to sell shares, could place downward pressure on the trading price of our stock. In addition, the lack of a robust resale market may require a stockholder who desires to sell a large number of shares of common stock to sell the shares in increments over time to mitigate any adverse impact of the sales on the market price of our stock. If our stockholders sell, or the market perceives that our stockholders intend to sell for various reasons, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We may never obtain substantial research coverage by industry or financial analysts. If no or few analysts commence or continue coverage of us, the trading price of our stock would likely decrease. Even if we do obtain analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 82163, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ADMP"}
