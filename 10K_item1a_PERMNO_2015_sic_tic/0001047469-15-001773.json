{"cik": "921547", "company": "HERITAGE OAKS BANCORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-06", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nIn the course of conducting its business operations, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent in the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to its own business. The following discussion addresses the most significant risks that could affect the Company's business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and capital position. The risks identified below are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all risks faced by the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that the Company is not aware of or that the Company currently deems immaterial may also impair our business.\nRenewed weakness in economic conditions could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nOur performance could be materially and adversely affected to the extent there is deterioration in business and economic conditions that have a direct or indirect adverse effect on us, our customers and our counterparties. These conditions could result in one of the following: (i) a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us, (ii) a decrease in customer savings generally and a corresponding decrease in the demand for savings and investment products offered by us, and (iii) an increase in the number of customers and counterparties that become delinquent, file for protection under the bankruptcy laws and/or default on their loans and other obligations to us. An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higher level of non-performing assets, provisioning for credit losses, and valuation adjustments on loans held-for-sale.\nWe are highly dependent on the real estate market on the Central Coast of California and a renewed downturn in the real estate market may have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate. Although we have seen what we believe are the signs of stabilization in the local economies in which we operate, a renewed decline in economic conditions, the local housing market or rising interest rates could have an adverse effect on the demand for new loans (as evidenced by the downturn in mortgage lending activities in the second half of 2013), the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, the value of real estate and other collateral securing loans or the value of real estate owned by us, any combination of which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, a large portion of the loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate that is subject to risks related to acts of nature, including drought, earthquakes, floods and fires. To the extent that these events occur, they may cause uninsured damage and other loss of value to real estate that secures these loans, which may also materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results of operations and financial condition can be impacted by the effect of the drought in California on our agricultural and related business.\nThe Company provides financing to agricultural businesses and other industries dependent on agriculture in the Central Coast. We recognize the cyclical nature of the industry, often caused by fluctuating commodity prices and changing climatic conditions. The Company remains committed to providing credit to agricultural customers and will always have a material exposure to this industry. In addition, the State of California has been experiencing drought conditions since 2013. The lack of rain will have an adverse impact on our agricultural customers' operating costs, crop yields and crop quality, which could impact such customers' ability to repay their loans to us consistent with the terms of such loans. The longer the drought continues, the more significant this impact will become. As a result, the Company's results of operations, financial condition, cash-flows and stock price can be negatively influenced by the impact of the drought on the banking needs of our agricultural customers.\nWe have a concentration in commercial real estate loans.\nWe have a high concentration in commercial real estate (\"CRE\") loans. CRE loans are defined as construction, land development, other land loans, loans secured by multi-family (5 or more units) residential properties and loans secured by non-farm, non-residential properties. Following this definition, approximately 59.6% of our gross loans can be classified as CRE lending as of December 31, 2014. CRE loans generally involve a higher degree of credit risk than certain other types of lending due to, among other things, the generally large amounts loaned to individual borrowers. Losses incurred on loans to a small number of these borrowers could have a material and adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, commercial real estate loans generally depend on the cash flow from the property to service the debt. Cash flow may be adversely affected by general economic conditions, which may result in non-performance by certain borrowers.\nThe Company and the Bank are operating under enhanced regulatory supervision that could materially and adversely affect our business.\nOn November 5, 2014, the FDIC and DBO issued the Consent Order to the Bank. The issuance of the Consent Order relates to deficiencies identified by the FDIC and DBO in the Bank's centralized Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-money Laundering (\"BSA/AML\") compliance program, which is designed to comply with the BSA/AML requirements. Per the Consent Order, the Bank must review, update and implement an enhanced BSA/AML risk assessment process based on the 2010 Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council BSA/AML Examination Manual. Some of the areas highlighted in the Consent Order include the requirements to: i) enhance customer due-diligence procedures; ii) improve the enhanced due diligence analysis for high-risk customers; iii) ensure the proper identification and reporting of suspicious activity; iv) address and correct the noted violations of law; v) ensure that there is sufficient and qualified staff; and vi) ensure that all staff are properly trained to carry out the BSA/AML programs. Certain activities, including expansionary activities, that otherwise require regulatory approval will likely be impeded while the Consent Order remains outstanding. Our failure to comply with the Consent Order and successfully implement an enhanced BSA/AML Compliance Program may result in additional regulatory action, including civil money penalties against the Bank and its officers and directors or enforcement of the Consent Order through court proceedings, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and stock price.\nThe Company also generally expects more intense scrutiny from bank supervisors in the examination process and more aggressive enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels. Federal banking law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal banking regulators. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive relief against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties. These enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices.\nThe cost and other effects of the full implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act remain unknown and may have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nThe full compliance burden and impact on our operations and profitability with respect to the Dodd-Frank Act remain uncertain, as the Dodd-Frank Act delegates to various federal agencies the task of implementing its many provisions through regulation. Although many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have been implemented, federal rules and policies in this area and the effects of their implementation will be further developing for some time to come. Individually and collectively, the regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may significantly increase our regulation and compliance obligations, thereby exposing us to higher costs and noncompliance risk, which could materially and adversely affect the Company's and the Bank's business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther significant changes in banking laws or regulations, the interpretation of those rules and regulations, and changes in federal monetary policy could materially affect our business.\nIn addition to the Dodd-Frank Act discussed above, the banking industry is subject to extensive federal and state regulation. The implementation of new laws or changes in existing laws, including changes in the interpretations of such laws and related rules and regulations by regulators, courts or others, could have a negative impact on our business. Federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. Significant changes in these laws and regulations could materially and adversely affect our business. We cannot predict the substance or impact of any change in regulation, whether by regulators or as a result of legislation, or in the way such statutory or regulatory requirements are interpreted or enforced. Compliance with such current and potential regulation and scrutiny may significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our business practices, require us to increase our regulatory capital and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner.\nOur business is also impacted by federal monetary policy, particularly as implemented through the Federal Reserve Board. Federal monetary policy significantly affects our credit conditions, primarily through open market operations in United States government securities, the discount rate for member bank borrowing, and\nbank reserve requirements. Changes in trade and monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board could have a material and adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nImplementation of new Basel III capital rules adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies will require increased capital levels that we may not be able to satisfy and could impede our growth and profitability.\nThe new Basel III capital rules became effective January 1, 2015. The new rules increase minimum capital ratios, add a new minimum common equity ratio, add a new capital conservation buffer, and change the risk-weightings of certain assets. These changes will be phased in through 2019. As the rules are phased in they could have a material and adverse effect on our liquidity, capital resources and financial condition (See Item 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation, for a further discussion of Basel III).\nOur business is subject to credit exposure and our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the probability of such borrowers making payments, as well as the value of real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans when considering the adequacy of the Company's allowance. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for loan and lease losses may be insufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, which may adversely impact our operating results. Our regulators, as an integral part of their regular examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase it by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses or to decrease our allowance for loan losses by recognizing loan charge-offs. Any additional provisions for loan losses or charge-offs, as required by these regulatory agencies, could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company's business is subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may negatively affect its financial performance.\nA substantial portion of the Company's income is derived from the differential or \"spread\" between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest earning assets, and the interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company's control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities. As interest rates change, net interest income is affected. With fixed rate assets (such as fixed rate loans and investment securities) and liabilities (such as certificates of deposit), the effect on net interest income depends on the cash flows associated with the maturity of the asset or liability. Asset/liability management policy may not be successfully implemented and from time to time the Company's risk position may not be balanced. An unanticipated rapid decrease or increase in interest rates could have an adverse effect on the spreads between the interest rates earned on assets and the rates of interest paid on liabilities, and therefore on the level of net interest income. For instance, any rapid increase in interest rates in the future could result in interest expense increasing faster than interest income because of fixed rate loans and longer term investments. Further, substantially higher interest rates could reduce loan demand and may result in slower loan growth than previously experienced. Any one of these occurrences would have a material and adverse effect on the Company's results of operation and financial condition. Conversely, lower interest rates could lead to lower net interest margin due to maturing loans being financed at a lower rate as well as increased refinancing activity to lock in lower rates.\nCompetition from within and outside the financial services industry may materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe financial services business in our market area is highly competitive. It is becoming increasingly competitive due to changes in regulation, technological advances and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers. We face competition in attracting and retaining core business relationships. Increasing levels of competition in the banking and financial services business may reduce our market share,\ndecrease loan demand, cause the prices we charge for our services to fall, resulting in a decline in the rates we charge on loans and/or cause higher rates to be paid on deposits. Therefore, our results may differ in future periods depending upon the nature and level of competition.\nAdditionally, technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions, which historically have involved banks, through alternative methods. For example, consumers can now maintain funds, which would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \"disintermediation,\" could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and negatively impact our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a material and adverse effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us.\nDeclines in the market value of our investment portfolio may adversely affect our financial performance, liquidity and capital.\nWe maintain an investment portfolio that includes, but is not limited to, mortgage-backed securities, municipal securities and asset backed securities. The market value of investments in our portfolio has become increasingly volatile over the last few years, largely due to disruptions in the capital markets and fluctuations in long term interest rates. Due to increasing long term interest rates in 2014, we have seen a decline in the overall market value of our investment portfolio in 2014. The market value of investments may be affected by factors other than the underlying performance of the servicer of the securities, or the mortgages underlying the securities, such as changes in interest rates, credit ratings downgrades, adverse changes in the business climate, and a lack of liquidity in the secondary market for certain investment securities. Furthermore, problems at the federal and state government levels may trickle down to municipalities and adversely impact our investment in municipal bonds.\nOn a quarterly basis, we evaluate investments and other assets for impairment. We may be required to record impairment charges if our investments suffer a decline in value that is considered other-than-temporary. If we determine that a significant impairment has occurred, we would be required to charge the credit-related portion of the other-than-temporary impairment against earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the periods in which the charges occur.\nLoss of customer deposits could increase the Company's funding costs.\nThe Company relies on bank deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding. The Company competes with banks and other financial services companies for deposits. If the Company's competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits, the Company's funding costs may increase, either because the Company raises its rates to avoid losing deposits or because the Company loses deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding. Higher funding costs reduce the Company's net interest margin and net interest income. Checking and savings account balances and other forms of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. When customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, the Company may lose a relatively low cost source of funds, increasing the Company's funding costs and reducing the Company's net interest income.\nFailure to successfully execute our strategic plan may adversely affect our performance.\nOur financial performance and profitability depend on our ability to execute our corporate strategies. Each year, our board of directors approves our long-term strategic plan and annual operating budget. Our near-term business strategy includes pursuing organic growth within our geographic footprint within the markets we currently serve. Our failure to achieve organic loan and deposit growth in our current market area may adversely impact our near-term financial performance goals. Other factors that may adversely affect our ability to attain our long-term financial performance goals include an inability to control non-interest expense, including, but not limited to, rising employee compensation, regulatory compliance and healthcare costs, limitations imposed on us through regulatory actions, and our inability to increase net-interest income due to continued downward pressure on interest rates.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people can be intense and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them without offering very high compensation. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material and adverse impact on our business because of the loss of their skills, knowledge of our market and years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nThe bank regulatory agencies have published guidance and regulations which limit the manner and amount of compensation that banking organizations provide to employees. These regulations and guidance may materially and adversely affect our ability to retain key personnel. Due to these restrictions, we may not be able to successfully compete with other larger financial institutions to attract, retain and appropriately incentivize high performing employees. If we were to suffer such adverse effects with respect to our employees, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company faces operational risks that may result in unexpected losses.\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, data processing system failures and errors, customer or employee fraud and catastrophic failures resulting from terrorist acts or natural disasters. We maintain a system of internal controls to mitigate against such occurrences and maintain insurance coverage for such risks that are insurable, but should such an event occur that is not prevented or detected by our internal controls, or is uninsured or in excess of applicable insurance limits, it could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to significant financial and reputational risks from potential legal liability and regulatory action.\nWe face significant legal risks in our business, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against other financial institutions remain high. Increased litigation costs, substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to the Company, which in turn could adversely impact its business prospects.\nImpairment of goodwill or intangible assets would result in a charge to earnings.\nGoodwill and intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. We may be required to record a charge to earnings during the period in which any impairment of goodwill or intangibles is determined.\nThe Company's information systems may experience an interruption or security breach that may result in unexpected losses.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems.\nOur computer systems and network infrastructure are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities or identity theft. Financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means. Denial of service attacks have been launched against a number of large financial services institutions.\nDespite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, we will not be able to anticipate all security breaches of these types, nor will we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches. Persistent attackers may succeed in penetrating defenses given enough resources, time and motive. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications.\nEven the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise. Targeted social engineering attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent. The successful social engineer will attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to its data or that of its clients.\nA successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us serious negative consequences, including significant disruption of operations, misappropriation of confidential information, or damage to our computers or systems or those of our customers and counterparties. A successful security breach could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, significant litigation exposure, and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nNecessary changes in technology could be costly.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements.\nWe may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company relies on third party service providers for key systems, placing us and our customers at risk if the vendor has service outages, work stoppages or is subjected to attacks on their IT systems that expose information relating to us and our customers.\nThe Company uses a third party software service provider to perform all of its transaction data processing. The Company also outsources other customer service applications, such as on-line banking, ACH and wire transfers, to third party vendors. If these service providers were to experience technical difficulties or incur any extended outages in services, it could have a material and adverse impact on the Company and its customers. Because such service providers service us and other banks, their systems could be affected by denial of service attacks directed at their other bank customers. In addition, third parties may seek to penetrate our vendors' IT systems, obtain information about us or our customers or access our customers' accounts, and exploit that information to wrongfully withdraw or transfer our customers' funds, which could have material and adverse impacts on our customers and the Company. Further, if the Company was required to switch service\nproviders due to deterioration in service quality or other factors, there is no guarantee that it could obtain comparable services for a comparable price.\nOur operations face severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external risks.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of our deposit base; impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. The Central Coast of California is subject to earthquakes, fires and landslides. Operations in our market could be disrupted by both the evacuation of large portions of the population as well as damage and or lack of access to our banking and operation facilities. The local market that the Company serves is also currently facing drought conditions which could not only impact the largest industry in our market footprint, agriculture, but could have rippling effects on other industries, including hospitality. The occurrence of any such event could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMaintaining our reputation as a community bank is critical to our success and the failure to do so may materially and adversely affect our performance.\nWe are a community bank and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees, or otherwise, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may enter into new lines of business or offer new products and services which expose us to additional risk or which are not successful.\nWe may enter into new lines of business or offer new products or services as new opportunities arise or as our business strategy changes. New lines of business or new products or services may involve significant business, reputational or regulatory risk, including increased regulatory scrutiny. The success of these efforts depends on many factors, including the competitive landscape, market adoption and successful implementation. We may experience significant losses to the extent that we invest significant time and resources to a new line of business, product or service and it is not successful. There can be no assurance that we can successfully manage these risks and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur controls and procedures could fail or be circumvented.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurances of the effectiveness of these systems and controls, and that the objectives of these controls have been met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures, and any failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in accounting standards or tax legislation could have a negative impact on our business.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements or elected representatives approve changes to tax laws that could affect our corporate taxes. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on cash dividends from the Bank to meet our cash obligations.\nAs a holding company, dividends from our subsidiary bank provide a substantial portion of our cash flow used to service the interest payments on our trust preferred securities and any cash dividends to our preferred and\ncommon shareholders. Various statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends the Bank can pay to us without regulatory approval. If the Bank is unable to generate the profits necessary to service the interest payments, or we are unable to obtain regulatory approval to make dividends from the Bank to the Company, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur outstanding preferred stock impacts net income available to our common shareholders.\nOur Series C Preferred Stock may be dilutive to common shareholders to the extent the Company is profitable and shareholders should consider the dilutive nature of these securities in their calculation of earnings per common share. Also, the Company's preferred stock will receive preferential treatment in the event of the Company's liquidation, dissolution or winding-down, which could have a material and adverse effect on common shareholders in the event of such liquidation.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due us. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 90359, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "HEOP"}
