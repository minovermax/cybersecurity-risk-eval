Risk Factors\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe could materially adversely affect us. Other risks and uncertainties that we do not presently consider to be material or of which we are not presently aware may become important factors that affect us in the future. If any of the risks discussed below actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Accordingly, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report.\nEpidemics, pandemics or similar widespread public health concerns, such as COVID-19, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and demand for our products and services.\nSince January 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak, characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (\"WHO\") on March 11, 2020, has caused, and could possibly continue to cause a widespread health crisis and significantly disrupt the U.S. and global economies, markets and supply chains. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemic or disease outbreak on our business, financial condition, results of operations and the demand for our products and services in the future is uncertain, and it is impossible to predict whether any impacts we have experienced to date would continue or worsen in the future. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemic or disease outbreak will impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and demand for our products and services will depend on future developments including the ongoing geographic spread of the health crisis, the impact of disease mutations, the severity and duration of the health crisis, and the type and duration of actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemic or disease outbreak and the impact on the U.S. and the global economies, markets, and supply chains. COVID-19, and other adverse public health developments in countries and states where we operate, therefore, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and the demand for our products and services. These effects could include a negative impact on the availability of our employees, temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our business partners, customers, suppliers, third party service providers or other vendors, and the interruption of domestic and global supply chains, distribution channels, liquidity and capital markets. In addition, we have taken and will continue to take precautionary measures, including through consultation with governmental authorities and union representatives, intended to help minimize the risk of the COVID-19 pandemic to our employees, including implementing work-from-home protocols, instituting mandatory stay-at-home policies for those who are ill or significantly exposed to COVID-19, acquiring personal protective equipment (PPE), increasing sanitation and special sanitation of work areas, mandating social distancing (particularly among our employees engaged in manual processes), altering work arrangements to maintain social distancing and limiting visitors and non-employees at our facilities. Our business continuity plans and other safeguards, however, may not be effective to mitigate the results of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and any worsening of the global business and economic environment as a result may also exacerbate the following risk factors discussed below in this Form 10-K, any of which could have a material effect on us. This situation remains fluid and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.\nOperating Factors\nIn areas where we purchase leaf tobacco directly from farmers, we bear the risk that the tobacco we receive will not meet quality and quantity requirements.\nWhen we contract directly with tobacco farmers or tobacco farmer cooperatives, which is the method we use to purchase tobacco in most countries, we bear the risk that the tobacco delivered may not meet customer quality and quantity requirements. If the tobacco does not meet such market requirements, we may not be able to fill all of our customers\u2019 orders, and such failure would have an adverse effect on profitability and results of operations. In a contract market our obligation is to purchase the entire tobacco plant, which encompasses many leaf styles, therefore, we also have a risk that not all of that production will be readily marketable at prices that support acceptable margins. In addition, in many foreign countries where we purchase tobacco directly from farmers, we provide them with financing. Unless we receive marketable tobacco that meets the quality and quantity specifications of our customers, we bear the risk that we will not be able to fully recover our crop advances or recover them in a reasonable period of time.\nThe leaf tobacco industry is competitive, and we are heavily reliant on a few large customers.\nWe are one of two major independent global competitors in the leaf tobacco industry, both of whom are reliant upon a few large customers. The loss of one of those large customers or a significant decrease in their demand for our products or services could significantly decrease our sales of products or services, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The competition among leaf tobacco suppliers and dealers is based on the ability to meet customer requirements in the buying, processing, and financing of tobacco, and on the price charged for products and services. We believe that we consistently meet our customers\u2019 requirements and charge competitive prices. Since we rely upon a few significant customers, the consolidation or failure of any of these large customers, or a significant increase in their vertical integration, could contribute to a significant decrease in our sales of products and services.\nWe compete for both the purchase and sale of leaf with smaller leaf tobacco suppliers in some of the markets where we conduct business. Some of these smaller leaf tobacco suppliers operate in more than one country. Since they typically provide little or no support to farmers, these leaf tobacco suppliers typically have lower overhead requirements than we do. Due to their lower cost structures, they often can offer prices on products and services that are lower than our prices. Our customers also directly source leaf tobacco from farmers to meet some of their raw material needs. Direct sourcing provides our customers with some qualities and quantities of leaf tobacco that they prefer not to use in their existing blends and that may be offered for sale. This competition for both the sale and purchase of leaf, both with smaller leaf tobacco suppliers and direct sourcing, could reduce the volume of the leaf we handle and could negatively impact our financial results.\nOur financial results can be significantly affected by changes in the balance of supply and demand for leaf tobacco.\nWith respect to our leaf tobacco operations, our financial results can be significantly affected by changes in the overall balance of worldwide supply and demand for leaf tobacco. The demand for leaf tobacco, which is based upon customers\u2019 expectations of their future requirements, can change from time to time depending upon factors affecting the demand for their products. Our customers\u2019 expectations and their demand for leaf tobacco are influenced by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022trends in the global consumption of cigarettes,\n\u2022trends in consumption of cigars and other tobacco products,\n\u2022trends in consumption of alternative tobacco products, such as electronic nicotine delivery systems (\"ENDS\") and non-combustible products,\n\u2022levels of competition among our customers, and\n\u2022regulatory and governmental factors.\nThe world supply of leaf tobacco at any given time is a function of current tobacco production, inventories held by manufacturers, and the stocks of leaf tobacco held by leaf tobacco suppliers. Production of tobacco in a given year may be significantly affected by such factors as:\n\u2022demographic shifts that change the number of farmers or the amount of land available to grow tobacco,\n\u2022decisions by farmers to grow crops other than leaf tobacco,\n\u2022volume of annual tobacco plantings and yields realized by farmers,\n\u2022availability of crop inputs,\n\u2022weather and natural disasters, including any adverse weather conditions that may result from climate change, and\n\u2022crop infestation and disease.\nAny significant change in these factors could cause a material imbalance in the supply of and demand for tobacco, which would affect our results of operations.\nOur financial results will vary according to tobacco growing conditions, customer requirements, and other factors. These factors may also limit the ability to accurately forecast our future performance and increase the risk of an investment in our common stock or other securities.\nOur financial results, particularly our year-over-year quarterly comparisons, may be significantly affected by variations in tobacco growing seasons and fluctuations in crop sizes. The timing of the cultivation and delivery of tobacco is dependent upon a number of factors, including weather and other natural events, and our processing schedules and results of operations can be significantly altered by these factors. In addition, the potential impact of climate change is uncertain and may vary by geographic region. The possible effects, as described in various public accounts, could include changes in rainfall patterns, water shortages, changing storm patterns and intensities, and changing temperature levels that could adversely impact our costs and business operations and the supply and demand for leaf tobacco. Our operations also rely on dependable and efficient transportation services. A disruption in transportation services, as a result of climate change or otherwise, may also significantly impact our results of operations.\nFurther, the timing of customer orders and shipments may vary and may require us to keep tobacco in inventory and may also result in variations in quarterly and annual financial results. We base sales recognition on meeting our performance obligation under our contract with the customer, which generally occurs with the passage of ownership of the tobacco. Since individual shipments may represent significant amounts of revenue, our quarterly and annual financial results may vary significantly depending on the timing of needs and shipping instructions of our customers and the availability of transportation services. These fluctuations result in varying volumes and sales in given periods, which also reduce the comparability of financial results.\nMajor shifts in customer requirements for leaf tobacco supply may significantly affect our operating results.\nIf our customers significantly alter their requirements for tobacco volumes from certain regions, we may have to change our production facilities and alter our fixed asset base in certain origins. Permanent or long-term reduction in demand for tobacco from origins where we have operations may trigger restructuring and impairment charges. We may also need to make significant capital investments in other regions to develop the needed infrastructure to meet customer supply requirements.\nWe may not be able to increase prices to fully offset inflationary and other pressures on costs, such as raw products, packing materials, labor, energy, and distribution costs.\nAs a supplier of leaf tobacco and plant-based ingredients, we source our raw materials globally and rely on labor, energy, packing materials, and distribution resources to produce and distribute our products. Many of these materials and inputs are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including but not limited to changes in crop sizes, crop qualities, crop disease, product scarcity, fertilizer costs, energy costs, labor costs, currency fluctuations, import and export requirements (including tariffs), adverse weather events, pandemic illness (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), political instability or military conflict such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, and other factors that may be beyond our control. We try to pass along to our customers some or all cost increases through increases in the sales prices of our products. To the extent that price increases are not sufficient to offset the cost increases or we experience reductions in sales volumes, our business results and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWeather and other conditions can affect the marketability of our products.\nTobacco and other agricultural crops are subject to vagaries of weather and the environment that can, in some cases, change the quality or size of the crops. Severe weather conditions may occur with higher frequency or may be less predictable in the future due to the effects of climate change. If a weather event or other event is particularly severe, such as a volcanic eruption, major drought, hurricane, cyclone, typhoon, windstorm, or temperature or precipitation extreme, the affected crop could be destroyed or damaged to an extent that it would be less desirable to our customers, which would result in a reduction in operating results. If such an event is also widespread, it could affect our ability to acquire the quantity of tobacco or plant-based ingredients required by our customers or could prevent or impair our ability to process or ship products as planned. In addition, other factors can affect the marketability of our products, including, among other things, the presence of excess residues of crop protection agents or non-tobacco related materials. A significant event impacting the condition or quality of a large amount of any of the crops that we buy could make it difficult for us to sell these products or to fill customers\u2019 orders.\nLegal, regulatory or other market measures to address climate change could negatively affect our business operations.\nThe increasing concern over climate change may result in more regional, federal, foreign and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. In the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we and our suppliers are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve energy and resource efficiency, we may experience significant increases in our material and production costs. Our suppliers would likely pass all or a portion of their increased costs along to us. We may not be able to pass any resulting cost increases to our customers. Furthermore, we may be required to make additional investments of capital to maintain compliance with new laws and regulations. As a result, climate change or increased concern over climate change could negatively affect our business or operations.\nOur plant-based ingredients business is subject to industry-specific risks which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur plant-based ingredients business is subject to risks posed by food spoilage or food contamination; shifting consumer preferences; federal, state, and local food processing regulations; product tampering; and product liability claims. If one or more of these risks were to materialize, our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected, and our reputation might be damaged.\nDisruption of our supply chain for our plant-based ingredients operations could adversely affect our business.\nDamages or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, climate change, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, cyber-attack, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), governmental restrictions or mandates, strikes, import/export restrictions, political instability or military conflict such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, or other factors could impair our ability to produce or sell our plant-based ingredient products. Many of our plant-based ingredient product lines are manufactured at a single location or require raw materials that are currently sourced from a limited number of regions. The failure of third parties on which we rely, including those third parties who supply our raw materials, packaging, capital equipment and other necessary operation materials, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, may negatively impact our operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.\nWe may not be successful in pursuing strategic investments or acquisitions or realize the expected benefits of those transactions because of integration difficulties and other challenges.\nWhile we may identify opportunities for acquisitions and investments to support our growth strategy, as well as divestiture opportunities, our due diligence examinations and positions that we may take with respect to appropriate valuations for acquisitions and divestitures and other transaction terms and conditions may hinder our ability to successfully complete business transactions to achieve our strategic goals. We compete with other acquisitive entities for suitable acquisition candidates. This competition may increase the price for acquisitions and reduce the number of acquisition candidates available to us. As a result, our ability to acquire businesses in the future, and to acquire such businesses on favorable terms, may be limited. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from acquisitions will depend, in part, on successfully integrating each business with our Company as well as improving operating performance and profitability through our management efforts and capital investments. The risks to a successful integration and improvement of operating performance and profitability include, among others, failure to implement our business plan, unanticipated issues in integrating operations with ours, unanticipated changes in laws and regulations, regulatory, environmental and permitting issues, unfavorable customer reactions, the effect on our internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and difficulties in fully identifying and evaluating potential liabilities, risks and operating issues. In order to finance such acquisitions, we may need to obtain additional funds either through public or private financings, including bank and other secured and unsecured borrowings and the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that such financings would be available to us on reasonable terms or that any future issuances of securities in connection with acquisitions will not be dilutive to our shareholders. The occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our expected benefits of any acquisitions and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may be adversely impacted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately, including with respect to cybersecurity issues.\nThe efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment, and other business processes. The failure of our information technology systems (including those provided to us by third parties) to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, systems failures, security breaches or intrusions (including theft of confidential data), and viruses. Cyber attacks, data breaches or other breaches of our information security systems may cause equipment failures or disruptions to our operations. Our inability to operate our networks and security information systems as a results of such events, even for a short period of time, may result in significant expenses or operating disruptions. If we are unable to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks and other information security breaches, we may suffer financial and reputational damage, be subject to litigation, or incur remediation costs or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners, customers, suppliers, or employees.\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in technology security initiatives, information technology risk management, and disaster recovery plans. The cost and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining, and enhancing further data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly frequent, complex, and sophisticated cyber threats. Our efforts to deter, identify, mitigate, or eliminate future cyber threats may require significant additional expense and may not be successful.\nThe inability for us to attract, develop, retain, motivate, and maintain good relationships with our workforce, including key personnel, could negatively impact our business and our profitability.\nOur future success depends on our ability to attract, develop, retain, motivate, and maintain good relationships with qualified personnel, particularly those who have extensive expertise in leaf tobacco or plant-based ingredients operations and who may also have long service with our Company. We have such personnel in our senior executive leadership as well as in other key areas throughout our U.S. and international operations such as procurement, manufacturing, and sales, all of which are critical to our future growth and profitability.\nChanges in labor markets as a result of COVID-19 and other socioeconomic and demographic changes, have increased the competition for hiring and retaining talent. As a result of this competition, we may be unable to continue to attract, develop, retain, motivate, and maintain good relationships with suitably qualified individuals at acceptable compensation levels who have the managerial, operational, and technical knowledge and experience to meet our needs. Furthermore, the failure to execute on internal succession plans or to effectively transfer knowledge from exiting employees to others in the organization could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Even if we succeed in hiring new personnel to fill vacancies, lengthy training and orientation periods might be required before new employees are able to achieve necessary productivity levels. Any failure by us to attract, develop, retain, motivate, and maintain good relationships with qualified individuals could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on a seasonal workforce to meet our operational needs.\nOur tobacco operations depend in part on our ability to attract, train, motivate and retain qualified employees, many of whom are seasonal employees. We seek to manage seasonal wages and the timing of the hiring process to ensure the appropriate workforce is in place for peak and low seasons. Many of our tobacco operations are located in rural communities that may not have sufficient labor pools. If we are unable to hire sufficient personnel or successfully manage our seasonal workforce needs, we may not be able to meet our operational needs and our financial results could be negatively impacted.\nRegulatory and Governmental Factors\nGovernment efforts to regulate the production and consumption of tobacco products could have a significant impact on the businesses of our leaf tobacco customers, which would, in turn, affect our results of operations.\nGovernments continue their efforts to reduce the consumption of tobacco products globally by advancing regulations that, among other things, restrict or prohibit tobacco product use, advertising and promotion, increase taxes on tobacco products, limit nicotine levels in tobacco products, or eliminate the use of characterizing flavors.\nA number of such measures are included in the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (\u201cFCTC\u201d), which entered into force on February 27, 2005, and currently has 182 Parties to the Convention. The Conference of the Parties (\u201cCOP\u201d), which is the governing body of the WHO FCTC and is comprised of all Parties to the Convention, meets every two years to consider amendments to the agreement and track progress in the implementation of the treaty\u2019s 38 articles. It is not possible to predict how the signatories to the FCTC may choose to fulfill their obligations or the manner or the pace with which they may implement the FCTC articles, and they may take actions that could restrict or prohibit tobacco usage that could materially affect our business and our results of operations.\nWe also cannot predict the extent or speed at which the efforts of governments or non-governmental agencies to reduce tobacco consumption might affect the business of our primary customers. However, a significant decrease in worldwide tobacco consumption brought about by existing or future laws and regulations would reduce demand for tobacco products and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nGovernment actions can have a significant effect on the sourcing of leaf tobacco. If some of the current efforts are successful, we could have increased barriers in meeting our customers\u2019 requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our performance and results of operations.\nA variety of government actions can have a significant effect on the sourcing and production of leaf tobacco. If some of the current proposed efforts are successful, we could have increased barriers to meeting our customers\u2019 requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our performance and results of operations.\nThe WHO, through the FCTC, has specifically issued policy options and recommendations to promote crop diversification initiatives and alternatives to growing leaf tobacco in countries whose economies depend upon tobacco production. If certain countries were to follow these policy recommendations and seek to eliminate or significantly reduce leaf tobacco production, we could encounter difficulty in sourcing leaf tobacco from these regions to fill customer requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nCertain recommendations by the WHO, through the FCTC, may also cause shifts in customer usage of certain styles of tobacco. In countries such as Canada and Brazil and in the European Union, efforts have been taken to eliminate certain ingredients from the manufacturing process for tobacco products. The FCTC and national governments have also discussed formulating a strategy to place limitations on the level of nicotine allowed in tobacco and tobacco smoke. Such decisions could cause a change in requirements for certain styles of tobacco in particular countries. Shifts in customer demand from one type of tobacco to another could create sourcing challenges as requirements move from one origin to another.\nRegulations impacting our customers that change the requirements for leaf tobacco or restrict their ability to sell their products would inherently impact our business. We have established programs that begin at the farm level to assist our customers\u2019 collection of raw material information to support leaf traceability and customer testing requirements, including the identification of nicotine levels. Additionally, given our global presence, we also have the ability to source different types and styles of tobacco for our customers should their needs change due to regulation. Despite our programs, the extent to which governmental actions will impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and demand for our products and services will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nContinuous changes in bilateral, multilateral, and international trade agreements also have the potential to disrupt or impact Universal operations. For example, the World Trade Organization\u2019s resolution on the Large Civil Aircraft Dispute between the United States and the European Union resulted in both bodies imposing tariffs on a variety of products, including leaf tobacco. While these tariffs have been temporarily lifted and negotiations continue, drastic changes in global trade remains a risk to our results of operations. In addition, some trade proposals have included provisions that could effectively allow governments to regulate tobacco products differently than other products. These carve outs could negatively impact the industry and impact requirements for leaf tobacco.\nWe conduct a significant portion of our operations internationally, so political and economic uncertainties in particular countries could have an adverse effect on our performance and results of operations.\nOur international operations are subject to uncertainties and risks relating to the political stability of certain foreign governments, principally in developing countries and emerging markets, as well as to the effects of changes in the trade policies and economic regulations of foreign governments. These uncertainties and risks, which include undeveloped or antiquated commercial law, the expropriation, indigenization, or nationalization of assets, and the authority to revoke or refuse to renew business licenses and work permits, may adversely impact our ability to effectively manage our operations in those countries. We have substantial capital investments in South America and Africa, and the performance of our operations in those regions can materially affect our earnings.\nOur customers\u2019 operations are subject to similar uncertainties and risks relating to the political stability of the foreign governments in the countries in which their operations are located. Political or economic instability in those countries, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, may impede or disrupt our ability to meet our customers\u2019 leaf tobacco needs in those impacted countries.\nIf the political situation in any of the countries where we conduct business were to deteriorate significantly, our ability to recover assets located there could be impaired. To the extent that we do not replace any lost volumes of leaf tobacco with leaf tobacco from other sources, or we incur increased costs related to such replacement, our financial condition or results of operations, or both, would suffer. In addition, if we are unable to supply leaf tobacco to our customers\u2019 locations or otherwise conduct business with our customers due to political stability or interference in their countries of operation, or if we incur increased cost related to such challenges, our performance and results of operations could suffer.\nIncreasing scrutiny and changing expectations from governments, as well as other stakeholders such as investors and customers, with respect to our ESG considerations may impose additional costs on us or expose us to additional risks.\nGovernments, the non-governmental community, and industry increasingly understand the importance of implementing comprehensive environmental, labor, and governance practices. Our commitment to sustainability remains at the core of our business, and we continue to implement what we believe are responsible ESG practices. Government regulations, however, could result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and disclosures. These may lead to increased expenditures for environmental controls, land use restrictions, reporting, and other conditions which could have an adverse effect on our performance and results of operations.\nIn addition, a number of governments are considering due diligence procedures to ensure strict compliance with environmental, labor, and government regulations. The European Union has recently proposed broad due diligence reporting requirements for all industries operating within Europe. The United States has called for a broader and more robust approach to labor compliance in foreign jurisdictions, which could include some of our strategic origins. Due to general uncertainty regarding the timing, content, and extent of any such regulatory changes in the United States or abroad, we cannot predict the impact, if any, that these changes could have to our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws in the countries where we do business may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThrough our subsidiaries, we are subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions. Changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws can affect our earnings, as can the resolution of various pending and contested tax issues. In most jurisdictions, we regularly have audits and examinations by the designated tax authorities, and additional tax assessments are common. We believe that we comply with applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions where we operate, and we vigorously contest all significant tax assessments where we believe we are in compliance with the tax laws.\nFinancial Factors\nFailure of our customers or suppliers to repay extensions of credit could materially impact our results of operations.\nIn our tobacco operations, we extend credit to both suppliers and customers. A significant bad debt provision related to amounts due could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, crop advances to leaf tobacco farmers are generally secured by the farmers\u2019 agreement to deliver green tobacco. In the event of crop failure, delivery failure, or permanent reductions in crop sizes, full recovery of advances may never be realized, or otherwise could be delayed until future crops are delivered. See Notes 1 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for more information on these extensions of credit.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our results of operations.\nWe account for most of our tobacco operations using the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. The international tobacco trade generally is conducted in U.S. dollars, and we finance most of our tobacco operations in U.S. dollars. Although this generally limits foreign exchange risk to the economic risk that is related to leaf purchase and production costs, overhead, and income taxes in the source country, significant currency movements could materially impact our results of operations. Changes in exchange rates can make a particular leaf tobacco crop more or less expensive in U.S. dollar terms. If a particular crop is viewed as expensive in U.S. dollar terms, it may be less attractive in the world market. This could negatively affect the profitability of\nthat crop and our results of operations. In tobacco markets that are primarily domestic, the local currency is the functional currency. In addition, the local currency is the functional currency in other leaf tobacco markets, such as Western Europe, where export sales have been denominated primarily in local currencies. In these markets, reported earnings are affected by the translation of the local currency into the U.S. dollar. See Item 7A, \u201cQualitative and Quantitative Disclosure About Market Risk\u201d for additional discussion related to foreign currency exchange risk.\nOur purchases of tobacco are generally made in local currency, and we also provide farmer advances that are denominated in the local currency. We account for currency remeasurement gains or losses on those advances as period costs, and they are usually accompanied by offsetting increases or decreases in the purchase cost of tobacco, which is priced in the local currency. The effect of differences in the cost of tobacco is generally not realized in our earnings until the tobacco is sold, which often occurs in a quarter or fiscal year subsequent to the recognition of the related remeasurement gains or losses. The difference in timing could affect our profitability in a given quarter or fiscal year.\nWe have used currency hedging strategies to reduce our foreign currency exchange rate risks in some markets. In addition, where we source tobacco in countries with illiquid or nonexistent forward foreign exchange markets, we often manage our foreign exchange risk by matching funding for tobacco inventory purchases with the currency of sale and by minimizing our net investment in these countries. To the extent that we have net monetary assets or liabilities in local currency, and those balances are not hedged, we may have currency remeasurement gains or losses that will affect our results of operations.\nChanges in interest rates may affect our results of operations.\nWe generally use both fixed and floating interest rate debt to finance our operations. Changes in market interest rates expose us to changes in cash flows for floating rate instruments and to changes in fair value for fixed rate instruments. We normally maintain a proportion of our debt in both variable and fixed interest rates to manage this exposure, and from time to time we may enter hedge agreements to swap the interest rates. In addition, our customers may pay market rates of interest for leaf tobacco inventory purchased on order, which could mitigate a portion of the floating interest rate exposure on short-term borrowings. To the extent we are unable to match these interest rates, a decrease in interest rates could increase our net financing costs. We also periodically have large cash balances and may receive deposits from tobacco customers, both of which we use to fund seasonal purchases of tobacco, reducing our financing needs. Decreases in short-term interest rates could reduce the income we derive from those investments. Changes in interest rates also affect expense related to our defined benefit pension plan, as described below.\nLow investment performance by our defined benefit pension plan assets and changes in pension plan valuation assumptions may increase our pension expense and may require us to fund a larger portion of our pension obligations, thus diverting funds from other potential uses.\nWe sponsor domestic defined benefit pension plans that cover certain eligible employees. Our results of operations may be positively or negatively affected by the amount of expense we record for these plans. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) require that we calculate expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions that may change based on changes in key economic indicators. The most significant year-end assumptions we used to estimate pension expense for fiscal year 2022 were the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and the mortality rates. In addition, we are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant change to shareholders\u2019 equity through a reduction or increase to the \u201cPension and other postretirement benefit plans\u201d component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. At the end of fiscal year 2022, the projected benefit obligation (\"PBO\") of our qualified U.S. pension plan was $237 million and plan assets were $250 million. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension plan valuation assumptions, see \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates - Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\u201d in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 and in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Although GAAP expense and pension funding contributions are not directly related, key economic factors that affect GAAP expense can also affect the amount of cash we are required to contribute to our pension plans under requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d). Failure to achieve expected returns on plan assets could also result in an increase to the amount of cash we would be required to contribute to our pension plans. In order to maintain or improve the funded status of our plans, we may also choose to contribute more cash to our plans than required by ERISA regulations.", "PERMNO": 16555, "SIC": 5150, "TIC": "UVV"}
