Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before deciding whether to invest in our securities, you should consider carefully the risks described below, together with other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other information and documents we file with the SEC. Our business, financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly, or indirectly, cause our actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and stock price.\nRisk Factor Summary\nBelow is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our common stock speculative or risky. This summary does not address all of the risks that we face. Additional discussion of risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we face, can be found below under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and should be carefully considered, together with other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC before making investment decisions regarding our common stock.\nRisks Related to the Proposed Merger\n\u25cf The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may pose risks and could harm business and results of operations for us and the combined company following the completion of the Merger.\n\u25cf There is no assurance when or if the Merger will be complete. Any delay in completing the Merger may substantially reduce the potential benefits that we expect to obtain from the Merger. Furthermore, the intended benefits of the Merger may not be realized.\n\u25cf The issuance of shares of our common stock to MYMD stockholders in the Merger will substantially dilute the voting power of current Akers stockholders. Having a minority share position will reduce the influence that current stockholders have on the management of the combined company.\n\u25cf The issuance, or expected issuance, of our common stock in connection with the Merger, including the Milestone Shares, could decrease the market price of our common stock.\n\u25cf Because the lack of a public market for MYMD common stock makes it difficult to evaluate the fairness of the Merger, MYMD stockholders may receive consideration in the Merger that is greater than or less than the fair market value of MYMD common stock.\n\u25cf Our directors and officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders generally that may influence them to support or approve the Merger.\n\u25cf If the Merger is completed, MYMD executive officers and MYMD appointees to the combined company\u2019s board of directors will have the ability to significantly influence the combined company\u2019s management and business affairs, as well as matters submitted to the combined company\u2019s board of directors or stockholders for approval, especially if they decide to act together with the current MYMD stockholders.\n\u25cf The announcement and pendency of the Merger could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or business prospects.\n\u25cf During the pendency of the Merger, we may not be able to enter into a business combination with another party and will be subject to contractual limitations on certain actions because of restrictions in the Merger Agreement.\n\u25cf Certain provisions of the Merger Agreement may discourage third parties from submitting competing proposals, including proposals that may be superior to the arrangements contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\n\u25cf The Exchange Ratio is not adjustable based on the market price of our common stock, so the merger consideration at the closing may have a greater or lesser value than at the time the Merger Agreement was signed.\n\u25cf We are expected to incur substantial expenses related to the Merger.\n\u25cf Failure to complete the Merger could negatively affect the value of our common stock and our future business and financial results.\n\u25cf The Merger may be completed even though material adverse changes may result from the announcement of the Merger, industry-wide changes or other causes.\n\u25cf We may become involved in additional securities litigation or stockholder derivate litigation in connection with the Merger, and this could divert the attention of our management and harm the combined company\u2019s business, and insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all related costs and damages.\n\u25cf The reverse stock split may not increase the combined company\u2019s stock price over the long term.\n\u25cf The reverse stock split would have the effect of increasing the amount of common stock that the combined company is authorized to issue without further approval by the combined company\u2019s stockholders.\n\u25cf The reverse stock split may decrease the liquidity of our common stock and lead to a decrease in overall market capitalization of the combined company.\nRisks Related to Our Business Prior to Consummation of the Merger\n\u25cf We have a history of operating losses and we cannot guarantee that we can ever achieve sustained profitability.\n\u25cf We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits related to our acquisition of Cystron and those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.\n\u25cf Our pursuit of the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate is at an early stage. We have not previously tested our rapid response capability and may be unable to produce a vaccine that successfully treats the virus in a timely manner, if at all.\n\u25cf We operate in a highly competitive industry.\n\u25cf Our business may be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u25cf With regard to our COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate, we must conduct pre-clinical testing, prepare and submit an IND to the FDA, and conduct all phases of clinical studies (which may include postmarket or \u201cPhase 4\u201d studies), which will likely take several years and substantial expenses to complete, before we can submit an application for marketing approval to the FDA, and there is no guarantee that we will complete such clinical development in a timely manner or at all or that our BLA will be approved, if submitted.\n\u25cf We may be unable to advance the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate successfully through the pre-clinical and clinical development process.\n\u25cf Governmental involvement may limit the commercial success of the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate.\n\u25cf Even if we are able to commercialize our prospective or future product candidates, the products may not receive coverage or adequate reimbursement from third-party payors in the United States or in other countries in which we seek to commercialize such products, which could harm our business.\n\u25cf We expect to require additional capital in the future in order to develop the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate. If we do not obtain any such additional financing, it may be difficult to complete development of the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate or effectively realize our long-term strategic goals and objectives.\n\u25cf Our failure to meet the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a delisting of our common stock. The delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and the market price of our common stock could decrease.\nIn addition, we face other business, financial, operational and legal risks and uncertainties set forth under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to the Proposed Merger\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may pose risks and could harm business and results of operations for each of Akers, MYMD, and the combined company following the completion of the merger.\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in, and is likely to continue to result in, substantial disruptions to markets and economies around the world, including the United States.\nGiven the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our businesses, or the business of MYMD, and the combined company following the completion of the Merger, and there is no guarantee that our efforts, or the efforts of MYMD, and the combined company following the completion of the Merger to address the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will be effective. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the duration of the pandemic, continued travel restrictions, social distancing requirements, and government mandates, among others.\nCOVID-19 poses a material risk to the business, financial condition and results of operations of both us and MYMD, and potentially could create risks for the combined company following the completion of the merger, including:\n\u25cf potential delays or impacts on business operations, product candidate development efforts, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole;\n\u25cf effects on key employees, including operational management personnel and those charged with preparing, monitoring and evaluating the companies\u2019 financial reporting and internal controls; and\n\u25cf increasing or protracted volatility in the price of our common stock.\nThese factors, together or in combination with other events or occurrences not yet known or anticipated, could adversely affect the value of the merger consideration or could delay or prevent the completion of the Merger and the related transactions. If we are, or MYMD is, unable to recover from a business disruption on a timely basis, the Merger and the combined company\u2019s business and financial conditions and results of operations following the completion of the Merger could be adversely affected. The Merger may also be delayed and adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and become more costly. Each of Akers, MYMD, and the combined company may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions, which could adversely affect each of their financial condition and results of operations.\nThere is no assurance when or if the Merger will be completed. Any delay in completing the Merger may substantially reduce the potential benefits that we expect to obtain from the Merger.\nCompletion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, as set forth in the Merger Agreement, including the approval by our stockholders, approval by Nasdaq of our application for the initial listing of our common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger, and other customary closing conditions. There can be no assurance that we and MYMD will be able to satisfy the closing conditions or that closing conditions beyond our or MYMD\u2019s control will be satisfied or waived. If the conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Merger may not occur or may not be completed within the expected timeframe, and we may materially and adversely lose some or all of the potential benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the Merger and could result in additional transaction costs or other effects associated with uncertainty about the Merger. In addition, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we may extend the originally scheduled End Date (defined in the Merger Agreement as April 15, 2021) to a later date, but we will have to make additional loans to MYMD or purchase MYMD common stock for such extensions. Moreover, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expenses related to the Merger, such as legal and accounting fees, some of which must be paid even if the Merger is not completed.\nWe and MYMD can agree at any time to terminate the Merger Agreement, even if our stockholders and/or MYMD\u2019s securityholders have already adopted the Merger Agreement and thereby approved the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. We and MYMD can also terminate the Merger Agreement under other specified circumstances.\nIn addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated and our board of directors determines to seek another business combination, we may not be able to find a third party willing to provide equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration to be provided in the Merger. In such circumstances, our board of directors may elect to, among other things, divest all or a portion of our business, or take the steps necessary to liquidate all of our business and assets, and in either such case, the consideration that we receive may be less attractive than the consideration to be received by us pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nThe issuance of shares of our common stock to MYMD stockholders in the Merger will substantially dilute the voting power of our current stockholders. Having a minority share position will reduce the influence that current stockholders have on our management.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, upon the effectiveness of the Merger, (i) (\u201c MYMD stockholders\u201d) will be entitled to receive (x) the number of shares of Akers common stock equal to Exchange Ratio per share of MYMD common stock they hold, prior to giving effect to the proposed reverse stock split discussed below, (y) an amount in cash, on a pro rata basis, equal to the Additional Consideration, such payment to occur not later than 30 days after the last day of the Option Exercise Period, up to the maximum amount of cash consideration that may be received by MYMD stockholders without affecting the intended tax consequences of the merger, and (z) potential Milestone Shares payable upon achievement of certain market capitalization milestone events during the Milestone Period; and (ii) each outstanding option to purchase MYMD common stock granted under the MyMD Incentive Plan that has not previously been exercised prior to the closing of the Merger, whether or not vested, will be assumed by Akers subject to certain terms contained in the Merger Agreement, and become an option to purchase a number of shares of Akers common stock equal to the number of shares of MYMD common stock underlying such option multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, which options to purchase MYMD common stock shall be amended to expire on the second-year anniversary of the closing of the Merger, and the exercise price for each share of Akers common stock underlying an assumed option to purchase MYMD common stock will be equal to the exercise price per share of the option to purchase MYMD common stock in effect immediately prior to the completion of the Merger divided by the Exchange Ratio. Assuming the exercise in full of the outstanding Pre-Funded Warrants issued in connection with the Private Placement and including 9,979,664 shares of combined company common stock underlying options to purchase shares of MYMD common stock to be assumed at the closing of the Merger, (i) MYMD stockholders and optionholders will own approximately 80% of the equity of the combined company; and (ii) our current stockholders, holders of certain outstanding of our options and warrants (excluding shares issuable upon exercise of options and warrants having an exercise price in excess of $1.72, prior to giving effect to any such stock splits, combinations, reorganizations and the like with respect to the Akers common stock between the announcement of the Merger and the closing of the Merger) and holders of our outstanding RSUs immediately prior to the Merger will own approximately 20% of the equity of the combined company. Accordingly, the issuance of the shares of Akers common stock to MYMD stockholders in the Merger will significantly reduce the ownership stake and relative voting power of each share of Akers common stock held by current Akers stockholders. Consequently, following the Merger, the ability of our current stockholders to influence the management of the combined company will be substantially reduced.\nMoreover, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we agreed to pay Milestone Payments, payable in shares of Akers common stock to MYMD stockholders upon the achievement of certain market capitalization milestone events during the Milestone Period, up to the number of shares of Akers common stock issuable to the MYMD stockholders upon the closing of the Merger. In the event that such milestone events are achieved and Milestone Payments are made, our current stockholders will experience further reduction in relative voting power.\nThe issuance, or expected issuance, of our common stock in connection with the Merger could decrease the market price of our common stock.\nIn connection with the Merger and as part of the merger consideration, we expect to issue shares of our common stock to MYMD stockholders. The anticipated issuance of our common stock in the Merger may result in fluctuations in the market price of our common stock, including a stock price decrease. In addition, issuance of the milestone shares, if any applicable milestone is achieved, and the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares of our common stock may intend to sell shares could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nThe intended benefits of the Merger may not be realized.\nThe Merger poses risks for our ongoing operations, including, among others:\n\u25cf that senior management\u2019s attention may be diverted from the management of our current operations and development of the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate;\n\u25cf costs and expenses associated with any undisclosed or potential liabilities; and\n\u25cf unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating MYMD\u2019s and Akers\u2019 business in the combined company.\nAs a result of the foregoing, the combined company may be unable to realize the full strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Merger, and we cannot assure you that the Merger will be accretive to us in the near term or at all. Furthermore, if we fail to realize the intended benefits of the Merger, the market price of our common stock could decline to the extent that the market price reflects those benefits. Our stockholders will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interests in the Company without receiving any commensurate benefit, or only receiving part of the commensurate benefit to the extent the combined company is able to realize only part of the strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Merger.\nBecause the lack of a public market for MYMD common stock makes it difficult to evaluate the fairness of the Merger, MYMD stockholders may receive consideration in the Merger that is greater than or less than the fair market value of MYMD common stock.\nThe outstanding common stock of MYMD is privately held and is not traded in any public market. The lack of a public market makes it extremely difficult to determine the fair market value of MYMD shares. Since the percentages of Akers common stock to be issued to MYMD stockholders was determined based on negotiations between the parties, it is possible that the value of Akers common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger will be greater than the fair market value of MYMD shares. Alternatively, it is possible that the value of the shares of Akers common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger will be less than the fair market value of MYMD shares.\nOur directors and officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders generally that may influence them to support or approve the Merger.\nOur officers and directors may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or are in addition to, those of our stockholders generally. Effective upon the closing of the Merger, Christopher Schreiber, current President and Chief Executive Officer of Akers, is expected to serve as an executive officer of the Supera line of business. It is expected that four of the current directors of Akers, Messrs. Schreiber, Silverman, White and Schroeder, are to be appointed as directors of the combined company after the completion of the Merger and will receive cash and equity compensation in consideration for such service. The outstanding unvested RSUs held by our current executive officers and directors will vest in connection with the Merger. In addition, our directors and executive officers also have certain rights to indemnification or to directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance that will survive the completion of the Merger. These interests may have influenced our directors and executive officers to support or recommend the proposals that will be presented to our stockholders.\nIf the Merger is completed, MYMD executive officers and MYMD appointees to the combined company\u2019s board of directors will have the ability to significantly influence the combined company\u2019s management and business affairs, as well as matters submitted to the combined company\u2019s board of directors or stockholders for approval, especially if they decide to act together with the current MYMD stockholders.\nUpon completion of the merger, the former MYMD stockholders will own approximately 80% of the combined company on a partially diluted basis, excluding the effect of warrants issued in the Private Placement. If the Merger is completed, the combined company is expected to be led by MYMD executive officers. Furthermore, the combined company\u2019s anticipated board of directors will consist of seven members, three of which will be appointed by MYMD pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. As a result, such persons, if they choose to act together, will have the ability to significantly influence the combined company\u2019s management and business affairs, as well as matters submitted to the combined company\u2019s board of directors or stockholders for approval.\nThe announcement and pendency of the Merger could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or business prospects.\nThe announcement and pendency of the Merger could disrupt Akers\u2019 businesses in the following ways, among others:\n\u25cf Our current and prospective employees could experience uncertainty about their future roles within the combined company, and this uncertainty might adversely affect our ability to retain, recruit and motivate key personnel;\n\u25cf the attention of our management may be directed towards the completion of the Merger and other transaction-related considerations and may be diverted from the day-to-day business operations of the Company, and matters related to the Merger may require commitments of time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that might have been beneficial to Akers;\n\u25cf customers, prospective customers, suppliers, collaborators and other third parties with business relationships with Akers may decide not to renew or may decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with Akers as a result of the Merger, whether pursuant to the terms of their existing agreements with Akers; and\n\u25cf the market price of Akers\u2019 common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the proposed Merger will be completed.\nShould they occur, any of these matters could adversely affect our businesses of, or harm our financial condition, results of operations or business prospects.\nDuring the pendency of the Merger, we may not be able to enter into a business combination with another party and will be subject to contractual limitations on certain actions because of restrictions in the Merger Agreement.\nCovenants in the Merger Agreement impede our ability to make dispositions or acquisitions or complete other transactions that are not in the ordinary course of business pending completion of the Merger, other than the Supera Purchase, potential spin-off of all or a portion of our assets prior to the consummation of the Merger, and certain permitted financings as set forth in the Merger Agreement. As a result, if the Merger is not completed, we may be at a disadvantage to our competitors. In addition, while the Merger Agreement is in effect and subject to limited exceptions, we are prohibited from soliciting, initiating, encouraging or taking actions designed to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that could lead to entering into certain extraordinary transactions with any third party, such as a sale of assets, an acquisition, a tender offer, a merger or other business combination outside the ordinary course of business. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities or other capital structure alternatives and making other changes to our business or executing certain of our business strategies prior to the completion of the Merger, which could be favorable to our stockholders.\nCertain provisions of the Merger Agreement may discourage third parties from submitting competing proposals, including proposals that may be superior to the arrangements contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nThe terms of the Merger Agreement prohibit us from soliciting competing proposals or cooperating with persons making unsolicited takeover proposals, except in limited circumstances if our board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside counsel, that an unsolicited competing proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to result in, a superior competing proposal and that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of our board of directors. In the event that our board of directors withdraws or modifies its recommendation for the Share Issuance Proposal based on such superior competing proposal, MYMD may terminate the Merger Agreement.\nThe rights of MYMD stockholders who become Akers stockholders in the Merger and Akers stockholders following the merger will be governed by the A&R Charter and the Akers Bylaws.\nUpon consummation of the Merger, outstanding shares of MYMD common stock will be converted into the right to receive shares of Akers common stock. MYMD stockholders who receive shares of Akers common stock in the merger will become Akers stockholders. As a result, MYMD stockholders who become stockholders in Akers will be governed by Akers\u2019 organizational documents and bylaws, rather than being governed by MYMD\u2019s organizational documents and bylaws. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Akers Charter will be amended and restated, subject to Akers stockholders\u2019 approval of the A&R Charter Proposal, immediately prior to the Effective Time.\nThe Exchange Ratio is not adjustable based on the market price of our common stock, so the merger consideration at the closing may have a greater or lesser value than at the time the Merger Agreement was signed.\nThe Merger Agreement has set the Exchange Ratio formula for the MYMD common stock, and the Exchange Ratio (as defined in the Merger Agreement) is only adjustable upward or downward to reflect our and MYMD\u2019s equity capitalization as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Any changes in the market price of common stock before the completion of the Merger will not affect the number of shares MYMD securityholders will be entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Therefore, if before the completion of the Merger, the market price of our common stock declines from the market price on the date of the Merger Agreement, then MYMD securityholders could receive merger consideration with substantially lower value. Similarly, if before the completion of the merger, the market price of our common stock increases from the market price on the date of the Merger Agreement, then MYMD securityholders could receive merger consideration with substantially more value for their shares of MYMD common stock than the parties had negotiated for in the establishment of the Exchange Ratio. In addition, the Exchange Ratio (as defined in the Merger Agreement) does not reflect the potential issuance of the Milestone Shares upon the achievement of certain market capitalization milestone events.\nIf the merger does not qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or is otherwise taxable to United States MYMD stockholders, then such holders may be required to pay United States federal income taxes.\nFor United States federal income tax purposes, the Merger is intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. If the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) or a court determines that the Merger should not be treated as a reorganization, a holder of MYMD common stock would recognize taxable gain or loss upon the exchange of MYMD common stock for our common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nWe are expected to incur substantial expenses related to the Merger.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, substantial expenses in connection with the Merger, as well as operating as a public company. We will incur significant fees and expenses relating to legal, accounting, financial advisory and other transaction fees and costs associated with the merger. Actual transaction costs may substantially exceed our estimates and may have an adverse effect on the combined company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nFailure to complete the Merger could negatively affect the value of our common stock and our future business and financial results.\nIf the Merger is not completed, our ongoing businesses could be adversely affected and we will be subject to a variety of risks associated with the failure to complete the Merger, including without limitation the following:\n\u25cf diversion of management focus and resources from operational matters and other strategic opportunities while working to implement the Merger;\n\u25cf reputational harm due to the adverse perception of any failure to successfully complete the Merger; and\n\u25cf having to pay certain costs relating to the Merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory, filing and printing fees.\nIf the Merger is not completed, these risks could materially affect the market price of our common stock and our business and financial results (including the cessation of our operations).\nThe Merger is expected to result in a limitation on the combined company\u2019s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforward.\nUnder Section 382 of the Code, use of our net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) will be limited if we experience a cumulative change in ownership of greater than 50% in a moving three-year period. At December 31, 2020, we had approximately $100,615,000 of operating loss carryforwards for federal and approximately $7,548,000 for New Jersey state tax purposes that may be applied against future taxable income. We will experience an ownership change as a result of the Merger and therefore our ability to utilize our NOLs and certain credit carryforwards remaining at the Effective Time will be limited. The limitation will be determined by the fair market value of our common stock outstanding prior to the ownership change, multiplied by the applicable federal rate. It is expected that the Merger will impose a limitation on our NOLs. Limitations imposed on our ability to utilize NOLs could cause United States federal and state income taxes to be paid earlier than would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such NOLs to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs.\nThe opinion received by our board of directors from Gemini Valuation Services (\u201cGVS\u201d) has not been, and is not expected to be, updated to reflect changes in circumstances that may have occurred since the date of the opinion.\nAt a board of directors meeting held on November 11, 2020, our financial advisor, GVS, rendered its opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the contribution made and consideration received by the holders of our common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement and rendered its oral opinion to our board of directors (which was subsequently confirmed in writing as of November 11, 2020) that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations set forth in such opinion, the contribution made and consideration received by the holders of our common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair to the holders of our common stock from a financial point of view. Such opinion was one of many factors considered by our board of directors in approving the Merger. The opinion does not speak as of the time the Merger will be completed or any date other than the date of such opinion. Subsequent changes in our or MYMD\u2019s operation and prospects, general market and economic conditions and other factors that may be beyond our control, may significantly alter the value of Akers or MYMD or the prices of the shares of our common stock by the time the Merger is to be completed. The opinion does not address the fairness of the merger consideration from a financial point of view to us at the time the Merger is to be completed, or as of any other date other than the date of such opinion, and the Merger Agreement does not require that the opinion be updated, revised or reaffirmed prior to the closing of the Merger to reflect any changes in circumstances between the date of the signing of the Merger Agreement and the completion of the Merger as a condition to closing the Merger.\nThe Merger may be completed even though material adverse changes may result from the announcement of the Merger, industry-wide changes or other causes.\nIn general, either party can refuse to complete the Merger if there is a material adverse effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) affecting the other party between November 11, 2020, the date of the Merger Agreement, and the closing of the Merger. However, some types of changes do not permit either party to refuse to complete the merger, even if such changes would have a material adverse effect on Akers or MYMD, as the case may be:\n\u25cf changes or events affecting the industries or industry sectors in which the parties operate generally;\n\u25cf changes or events generally affecting the U.S. or global economy or capital markets as a whole;\n\u25cf with respect to us, changes in the trading price or trading volume of our common stock;\n\u25cf hurricane, flood, tornado, earthquake or other natural disaster, epidemic, plague, pandemic (including the COVID-19 pandemic) or other public health event or any other force majeure event;\n\u25cf changes in GAAP or other applicable law or legal requirement;\n\u25cf changes caused by the announcement or pendency of the Merger; or\n\u25cf changes caused by any action taken, or the failure to take any action that is expressly required by the Merger Agreement.\nIf adverse changes occur but we must still complete the merger, the market price of our common stock may suffer.\nWe may become involved in additional securities litigation or stockholder derivative litigation in connection with the merger, and this could divert the attention of our management and harm the combined company\u2019s business, and insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all related costs and damages.\nSecurities litigation or stockholder derivative litigation frequently follows the announcement of certain significant business transactions, such as the sale of a business division or announcement of a business combination transaction. Between January 22, 2021 and February 10, 2021, five alleged Akers stockholders filed separate actions in the state and federal courts of New York and New Jersey against Akers and the members of its board of directors, respectively captioned as follows: (i) Douglas McClain v. Akers Biosciences, Inc., et al., No. 650497/2021 (Sup. Ct., N.Y. Cty.); (ii) Owen Murphy v. Akers Biosciences, Inc., et al., No. 650545/2021 (Sup. Ct., N.Y. Cty.); Sue Gee Cheng v. Akers Biosciences, Inc., et al., No. 1:21-cv-01110 (S.D.N.Y.); Danny Lui v. Akers Biosciences, Inc., et al., No. GLO-C-000006-21 (N.J. Super. Ct., Ch. Div.); and Alan Misenheimer v. Akers Biosciences, Inc., et al., No. 1:21-cv-02310 (D.N.J.) (collectively, the \u201cMYMD Merger Complaints\u201d). The McClain and Lui actions are styled as putative class actions brought on behalf of the plaintiff and other similarly situated stockholders, while the Murphy, Cheng, and Misenheimer actions are brought solely on behalf of the individual stockholders. The MYMD Merger Complaints generally assert that Akers and its board of directors failed to disclose allegedly material information in the joint proxy and consent solicitation statement/prospectus and seek an order enjoining or unwinding the consummation of the Merger Agreement and awarding damages. The defendants believe that the claims asserted in the MYMD Merger Complaints are without merit and intend to appropriately defend themselves against them. Accordingly, we do not expect that these claims will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. We may become involved in more of this type of litigation in connection with the Merger, and the combined company may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation often is expensive and diverts management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business and the business of the combined company.\nIf the Merger is consummated, the business operations, strategies and focus of the combined company will fundamentally change, and these changes may not result in an improvement in the value of its common stock.\nPending the consummation of the Merger, it is currently anticipated that the combined company would focus its resources on executing MYMD\u2019s current business plan. In addition, prior to the consummation of the Merger, we may, in our discretion, consummate a spin-off of all or a part of our legacy assets. In the event we consummate such spin-off, the stockholders of Akers and MYMD will not participate in the future prospects of such legacy assets.\nFollowing the Merger, it is expected that the combined company\u2019s primary products will be MYMD\u2019s product candidates: MyMD-1, a clinical-stage immunometabolic regulator and Supera-1R, a pre-clinical stage patented synthetic cannabidiol derivative. Consequently, if the merger is consummated, an investment in our common stock will primarily represent an investment in the business operations, strategies and focus of MYMD. MYMD expects to incur losses as it develops its product candidates, and MYMD\u2019s product candidates, may never get approved by the FDA or even if approved for marketing, may not be profitable. The failure to successfully develop product candidates will significantly diminish the anticipated benefits of the Merger and have a material adverse effect on the business of the combined company. There is no assurance that the combined company\u2019s business operations, strategies or focus will be successful following the Merger, and the Merger could depress the value of the combined company\u2019s common stock.\nThe reverse stock split may not increase the combined company\u2019s stock price over the long term.\nIf the Reverse Stock Split Proposal is approved, the combined company anticipates effecting a reverse stock split at a reverse stock split ratio as mutually agreed to by Akers and MYMD, which range shall be sufficient to cause its stock price to be at least $5.00 immediately following the Merger. While it is expected that the reduction in the number of outstanding shares of common stock will proportionally increase the market price of the combined company\u2019s common stock upon effectiveness of the reverse stock split, it cannot be assured that the reverse stock split will result in any sustained proportionate increase in the market price of the combined company\u2019s common stock, which is dependent upon many factors, including the business and financial performance of the combined company, general market conditions, and prospects for future success, which are unrelated to the number of shares of the combined company\u2019s common stock outstanding. Thus, while the stock price of the combined company might meet the initial listing requirements for Nasdaq initially, it cannot be assured that it will continue to do so.\nThe reverse stock split would have the effect of increasing the amount of common stock that the combined company is authorized to issue without further approval by the combined company\u2019s stockholders.\nThe proposed A&R Charter for the combined company is anticipated to authorize the combined company to issue 500,000,000 shares of common stock and does not anticipate reducing this amount in connection with the reverse stock split. Except in certain instances, as required by law or by the rules of the securities exchange that lists the combined company\u2019s common stock, these additional shares may be issued by the combined company without further vote of the combined company\u2019s stockholders. If the combined company\u2019s board of directors chooses to issue additional shares of the combined company\u2019s common stock, such issuance could have a dilutive effect on the equity, earnings and voting interests of the combined company\u2019s stockholders.\nThe reverse stock split may decrease the liquidity of our common stock.\nAlthough our board of directors believes that the anticipated increase in the market price of our common stock could encourage interest in our common stock and possibly promote greater liquidity for our stockholders, such liquidity could also be adversely affected by the reduced number of shares outstanding after the reverse stock split. The reduction in the number of outstanding shares may lead to reduced trading and a smaller number of market makers for our common stock.\nThe reverse stock split may lead to a decrease in overall market capitalization of the combined company.\nShould the market price of our common stock decline after the reverse stock split, the percentage decline may be greater, due to the smaller number of shares outstanding, than it would have been prior to the reverse stock split. A reverse stock split is often viewed negatively by the market and, consequently, can lead to a decrease in the overall market capitalization of the combined company. If the per share market price does not increase in proportion to the reverse stock split ratio, then the value of the combined company, as measured by its stock capitalization, will be reduced. In some cases, the per-share stock price of companies that have effected reverse stock splits subsequently declined back to pre-reverse split levels and, accordingly, it cannot be assured that the total market value of our common stock will remain the same after the reverse stock split is effected, or that the reverse stock split will not have an adverse effect on our stock price due to the reduced number of shares outstanding after the reverse stock split.\nRisks Related to Our Business Prior to Consummation of the Merger\nWe have a history of operating losses and we cannot guarantee that we can ever achieve sustained profitability.\nWe have recorded a net loss attributable to common stockholders in most reporting periods since our inception. We had a net loss of $17,580,609 during the year ended December 31, 2020. Our accumulated deficit at December 31, 2020 was $137,163,739. On account of the unfavorable factors existing within our rapid, point-of-care screening and testing products business, we ceased the production and sale of our screening testing products. We are focusing on the development and manufacturing of the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate, or combination product candidate in partnership with Premas and expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future. As part of our efforts to increase shareholder value, on November 11, 2020, Akers entered into the Merger Agreement with MYMD, pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into MYMD, with MYMD becoming our wholly owned subsidiary. For risks related to the merger, please see risk factors set forth under the heading \u201c- Risks Related to the Proposed Merger\u201d herein. However, there can be no assurance of success in reducing our loss, becoming profitable, or having sufficient cash to develop a COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate or to complete the consummation of the Merger.\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of Cystron and those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.\nOn March 23, 2020, we entered into the MIPA with the Cystron Sellers, pursuant to which we acquired the Cystron Membership Interests. Cystron is a party to a License and Development Agreement (the \u201cInitial License Agreement\u201d) with Premas. As a condition to our entry into the MIPA, Cystron amended and restated the Initial License Agreement on March 19, 2020 (as amended and restated, the \u201cLicense Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the License Agreement, Premas granted Cystron, amongst other things, an exclusive license with respect to Premas\u2019 vaccine platform for the development of the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to produce an effective vaccine against COVID-19. The development of the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate is in very early stages and there is no assurance that we will be able to produce an effective vaccine. Moreover, we have the right to terminate the License Agreement on a country-by-country basis for any reason or for no reason at any time upon sixty (60) days\u2019 prior written notice to Premas, and may decide to cease development of the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate and terminate the License Agreement. The failure to produce the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate or termination of the License Agreement could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we have incurred and expect to incur significant expenses related to the acquisition. These expenses include, but are not limited to, the Common Stock Consideration (as defined in the MIPA), a cash consideration of $1.0 million, related contingent fees, legal fees and other related fees and expenses. Many of these expenses have been paid or will be payable by us regardless of our ability to successfully develop the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate, and we will not be able to recover these expenses in the event that we fail to develop the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate.\nOur pursuit of the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate is at an early stage. We have not previously tested our rapid response capability and may be unable to produce a vaccine that successfully treats the virus in a timely manner, if at all.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are pursuing the rapid development of the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate. Our development of the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate is in early stages, and we may be unable to produce the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate. Additionally, our ability to develop an effective COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate depends on the success of its rapid response capability, which we have not previously tested and which will need to be funded by third parties in order to enable us to have sufficient capacity to respond to a global health challenge. If the COVID-19 pandemic is effectively contained or the risk of COVID-19 infection is diminished or eliminated before we can successfully develop and manufacture a COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate, including availabilities of effective vaccines, we may be unable to successfully generate revenue from the manufacturing of the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate. We are also committing financial resources and personnel to the development of the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate which may divert resources from other transactions, despite uncertainties surrounding the longevity and extent of COVID-19 as a global health concern. Our business could be negatively impacted by our allocation of significant resources to a global health threat that is unpredictable and could rapidly dissipate or against which the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate, if developed, may not be partially or fully effective.\nOur acquisition of Cystron could result in additional costs, integration or operating difficulties, dilution and other adverse consequences.\nIn connection with the acquisition of the Cystron and in pursuit of developing the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate, we may:\n\u25cf issue equity securities that may substantially dilute our stockholders\u2019 percentage of ownership;\n\u25cf be obligated to make milestone, royalty or other contingent or non-contingent payments; and\n\u25cf incur debt or non-recurring and other charges, or assume liabilities.\nIn addition, the process of integrating Cystron\u2019s business may create operating difficulties and expenditures and pose numerous additional risks to our operations, including:\n\u25cf failure to develop, manufacture or supply the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate economically or successfully commercialize or achieve market acceptance of the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate;\n\u25cf exposure to liabilities of Cystron, including known or unknown risks relating to the validity or enforceability of exclusivity rights and generic competition;\n\u25cf adverse effects on our operating results or financial condition, including due to expenditures or acquisition-related costs, costs of commercialization or amortization or impairment costs for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets;\n\u25cf impairment of relationships with key suppliers and manufacturers due to changes in management and ownership and difficulty in maintaining existing agreements, licenses and other arrangements or rights on substantially similar terms as existed prior to the acquisition;\n\u25cf regulatory changes and market dynamics after the acquisition; and\n\u25cf potential loss of key employees, particularly those of the acquired entity.\nIf any of the above events (or more) occur, or if we cannot effectively manage or respond to such events following the acquisition, they may have material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCystron is dependent on technologies that it has licensed, and Cystron may need to license in the future, and if Cystron fails to obtain licenses it needs, or fails to comply with its payment obligations in the agreements under which Cystron in-licenses intellectual property and other rights from third parties, Cystron could lose its ability to develop a COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate.\nCystron currently is dependent on a license from Premas for its key technologies. Any failure to make the payments required by the License Agreement may permit Premas to terminate the license. If Cystron were to lose or otherwise be unable to maintain the license for any reason, it would halt Cystron\u2019s ability to develop a COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate. The foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on Akers\u2019 business or results of operations.\nIn addition, Cystron does not own the patents or patent applications that it licenses, and as such, Cystron may need to rely upon Premas to properly prosecute and maintain those patent applications and prevent infringement of those patents. If Premas is unable to adequately protect the proprietary intellectual property Cystron licenses from legal challenges, or if Cystron is unable to enforce such licensed intellectual property against infringement or alternative technologies, Akers will not be able to compete effectively in the drug discovery and development business.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nWe face, and will continue to face, intense competition from large pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as academic and research institutions pursuing research and development of technologies, drugs or other therapies that would compete with our products or product candidates. The pharmaceutical market is highly competitive, subject to rapid technological change and significantly affected by existing rival drugs and medical procedures, new product introductions and the market activities of other participants. Our competitors may develop products more rapidly or more effectively than us. If our competitors are more successful in commercializing their products than us, their success could adversely affect our competitive position and harm our business prospects and may also lead to the diversion of funding away from us and toward other companies.\nSpecifically, the competitive landscape of potential COVID-19 vaccines and treatment therapies has been rapidly developing since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, with several hundreds of companies claiming to be investigating possible candidates and approximately 4,800 studies registered worldwide as investigating COVID-19 (source: clinicaltrials.gov). Given the global footprint and the widespread media attention on the COVID-19 pandemic, there are efforts by public and private entities to develop a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 as soon as possible, including large, multinational pharmaceutical companies such as AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer, and Sanofi, with vaccine candidates that are currently at more advanced stage of development than our COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate. In December 2020, the FDA began to issue emergency use authorizations for vaccines developed by certain of these large, multinational pharmaceutical companies and it is possible that additional vaccines developed by such large, multinational pharmaceutical companies may receive further approvals and authorizations in the near term. Those other entities may develop COVID-19 vaccines that are more effective than any vaccine we may develop, may develop a COVID-19 vaccine that becomes the standard of care, may develop a COVID-19 vaccine at a lower cost or earlier than we are able to jointly develop any COVID-19 vaccine, or may be more successful at commercializing a COVID-19 vaccine. Many of these other organizations are much larger than we are and have access to larger pools of capital, and as such, are able to fund and carry on larger research and development initiatives. Such other entities may have greater development capabilities than we do and have substantially greater experience in undertaking nonclinical and clinical testing of vaccine candidates, obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products. Our competitors may also have greater name recognition and better access to customers. In addition, based on the competitive landscape, additional COVID-19 vaccines or therapeutics may continue to be approved to be marketed. Should another party be successful in producing a more efficacious vaccine for COVID-19, such success could reduce the commercial opportunity for our COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. Moreover, if we experience delayed regulatory approvals or disputed clinical claims, we may not have a commercial or clinical advantage over competitors\u2019 products that we believe we currently possesses. The success or failure of other entities, or perceived success or failure, may adversely impact our ability to obtain any future funding for our vaccine development efforts or for us to ultimately commercialize and market any vaccine candidate, if approved. In addition, we may not be able to compete effectively if our product candidates do not satisfy government procurement requirements with respect to biodefense products.\nOur business may be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China and has reached multiple other countries, resulting in government-imposed quarantines, travel restrictions and other public health safety measures, including in the United States and India. On March 12, 2020, the WHO COVID-19 to be a global pandemic. The various precautionary measures taken by many governmental authorities around the world in order to limit the spread of COVID-19 have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on the global markets and global economy. Such government-imposed precautionary measures may have been relaxed in certain countries or states, but there is no assurance that more strict measures will not be put in place again due to a resurgence in COVID-19 cases.\nThe ultimate impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our vaccine development efforts, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, the effects are likely to have a material impact on our operations, liquidity and capital resources, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely.\nIn response to public health directives and orders, we implemented and have continued to maintain work-from-home policies for many of our employees and the temporary modification of our operations to comply with applicable social distancing recommendations. The effects of the orders and our related adjustments in our business are likely to negatively impact productivity, disrupt our business and delay our timelines, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course. Similar health directives and orders are affecting third parties with whom we do business, including Premas, whose operations are located in India. Further, restrictions on our ability to travel, stay-at-home orders and other similar restrictions on our business have limited, and may continue to limit, our ability to support our operations.\nSevere and/or long-term disruptions in our operations will negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition in other ways as well. Specifically, we anticipate that the stress of COVID-19 on healthcare systems generally around the globe will negatively impact regulatory authorities and the third parties that we and Premas may engage in connection with the development and testing of our COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate.\nThe anticipated economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely impacted financial markets, resulting in high share price volatility, reduced market liquidity, and substantial declines in the market prices of the shares of most publicly traded companies, including Akers. Volatile or declining markets for equities could adversely affect our ability to raise capital when needed through the sale of shares of common stock or other equity securities. Should these market conditions persist when we need to raise capital, and if we are able to sell shares of our common stock under then prevailing market conditions, we might have to accept lower prices for our shares and issue a larger number of shares than might have been the case under better market conditions, resulting in significant dilution of the interests of our shareholders.\nRisks Related to Our Product Development\nWith regard to our COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate, we must conduct pre-clinical testing, prepare and submit an IND to the FDA, and conduct all phases of clinical studies (which may include postmarket or \u201cPhase 4\u201d studies), which will likely take several years and substantial expenses to complete, before we can submit an application for marketing approval to the FDA, and there is no guarantee that we will complete such clinical development in a timely manner or at all or that our BLA will be approved, if submitted.\nWe expect that a substantial portion of our efforts and expenditures over the next few years will be devoted to our COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate. Accordingly, our business currently depends heavily on the successful development, FDA approval, and commercialization of such candidate, which may never receive FDA approval or be successfully commercialized even if FDA approval is received. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, sale, marketing, and distribution of the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate are, and will remain, subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries, as applicable. We are not permitted to market our tablet vaccines in the United States until we receive FDA approval of our applicable BLA. To date, we have not-yet begun any pre-clinical studies for the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate, nor have we prepared or submitted an IND. Accordingly, we have not submitted a BLA to the FDA or comparable applications to other regulatory authorities and do not expect to be in a position to do so for the foreseeable future, as there are numerous developmental steps that must be completed before we can prepare and submit a BLA.\nIn the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical and biological products (including vaccines and vaccine candidates, such as the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate currently in early stages of development) under the FD&C Act and the PHSA, as well as their respective implementing regulations. Such products and product candidates are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:\n\u25cf completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests and animal studies in accordance with FDA\u2019s GLPs and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;\n\u25cf submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials in the United States may begin;\n\u25cf performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with FDA\u2019s IND regulations, GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use;\n\u25cf submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that meets applicable requirements to ensure the continued safety, purity, and potency of the product that is the subject of the BLA based on results of pre-clinical testing and clinical trials;\n\u25cf satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced, to assess compliance with current cGMPs and assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product\u2019s identity, strength, quality and purity;\n\u25cf potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and\n\u25cf FDA review and approval, or denial, of the BLA.\nNotwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials is not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate is in the earliest stages of clinical development and, therefore, a long way from BLA submission. We cannot predict with any certainty if or when we might submit a BLA for regulatory approval for the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate or whether any such BLA will be approved by the FDA. Human clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. For example, the FDA may not agree with our proposed endpoints for any clinical trial we propose, which may delay the commencement of our clinical trials. The clinical trial process is also lengthy and requires substantial time and effort. We estimate that the clinical trials we need to conduct to be in a position to submit a BLA for the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate will take several years to complete. Furthermore, failure can occur at any stage of the trials, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials. Also, the results of early pre-clinical and clinical testing of the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate may not be predictive of the results of subsequent clinical trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier studies. Moreover, pre-clinical and clinical data are often susceptible to multiple interpretations and analyses. Many companies that have believed their vaccine candidates performed satisfactorily in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials have, nonetheless, failed to obtain marketing approval of their products. Success in pre-clinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials, which involve many more subjects, will be successful, and the results of later clinical trials may not replicate the results of prior clinical trials and pre-clinical testing. Any failure or substantial delay in our vaccine development plans may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may opt to conduct future clinical studies for the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate outside the United States, which could heighten the risk of delay and/or failure, as the FDA may not accept data from such studies in support of any BLA we may submit after completing the applicable developmental and regulatory prerequisites, if ever.\nWe are still in the earliest stages of development with respect to the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate and may ultimately decide to conduct pre-clinical and/or clinical studies in one or more countries outside the United States. Although the FDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States that are not conducted under an IND, the FDA\u2019s acceptance of such data is subject to certain conditions. For example, the clinical trial must be well designed and conducted and performed by qualified investigators in accordance with ethical principles and all applicable FDA regulations. The trial population must also adequately represent the intended United States population, and the data must be applicable to the United States population and United States medical practice in ways that the FDA deems clinically meaningful. In general, the patient population for any clinical trials conducted outside of the United States must be representative of the population for whom we intend to market the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate in the United States, if approved. In addition, while these clinical trials are subject to the applicable local laws, FDA acceptance of the data will be dependent upon its ability to verify the data and its determination that the trials also complied with all applicable United States laws and regulations. We cannot guarantee that the FDA will accept data from trials we conduct outside of the United States, if any. If the FDA does not accept the data from such clinical trials, it would likely result in the need for additional trials and the completion of additional regulatory steps, which would be costly and time-consuming and could delay or permanently halt our development of the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate.\nIf we are successful in producing the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate, we may need to devote significant resources to our scale-up and development including for use by the United States government.\nIn the event that the pre-clinical and clinical trials for the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate are perceived to be successful, we may need to work toward the large scale technical development, manufacturing scale-up and larger scale deployment of this potential vaccine through a variety of United States government mechanisms such as an Expanded Access Program or an Emergency Use Authorization program. In this case, we may need to divert significant resources to this program, which would require diversion of resources from our other businesses. In addition, since the path to licensure of any vaccine against COVID-19 is unclear, if use of the vaccine is mandated by the United States government, we may have a widely used vaccine in circulation in the United States or another country prior to our full validation of the overall long term safety and efficacy profile of its vaccine platform and technology. Unexpected safety issues in these circumstances could lead to significant reputational damage for the Company going forward and other issues, including delays in our other programs, the need for re-design of our clinical trials and the need for significant additional financial resources.\nWe may be unable to advance the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate successfully through the pre-clinical and clinical development process.\nOur ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and ultimately commercialize, the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate effectively will depend on many factors, including the following:\n\u25cf successful completion of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u25cf successful achievement of the objectives of planned pre-clinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u25cf receipt of marketing approvals from the FDA and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States;\n\u25cf establishing efficient and effective commercial manufacturing, supply and distribution arrangements;\n\u25cf establishing sufficient market share and promoting acceptance of the product by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\u25cf successfully executing an effective pricing and reimbursement strategy;\n\u25cf maintaining a continued acceptable safety and adverse event profile following regulatory approval; and\n\u25cf qualifying for, identifying, registering, maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims.\nThe COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate will require additional non-clinical and clinical development, regulatory review and approval, substantial investment, access to sufficient commercial manufacturing capacity and significant marketing efforts before we can be in a position to generate any revenue from product sales. We are not permitted to market or promote any vaccine before it receives regulatory approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and we may never receive such regulatory approval. If we are unable to develop or receive marketing approval in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to commercialize the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernment involvement may limit the commercial success of our COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has been classified as a pandemic by public health authorities, and it is possible that one or more government entities may take actions that directly or indirectly have the effect of abrogating some of our rights or opportunities.\nVarious government entities, including the United States government, are offering incentives, grants, and contracts to encourage additional investment by commercial organizations into preventative and therapeutic agents against COVID-19, which may have the effect of increasing the number of competitors and/or providing advantages to known competitors. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully establish a competitive market share, if any, for our COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate even if we succeed in developing one.\nIf we fail to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions, then we cannot market our products, including the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate, in those jurisdictions.\nMany foreign countries in which we market or may market our products have regulatory bodies and restrictions similar to those of the FDA. International sales are subject to foreign government regulation, the requirements of which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and the requirements may differ. We may be required to conduct additional testing or to provide additional information, resulting in additional expenses, to obtain necessary approvals. If we fail to obtain approval in such foreign jurisdictions, we would not be able to market our products, including the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate, in such jurisdictions, thereby reducing the potential revenue from the sale of our products.\nWe are subject to inspection and market surveillance by the FDA to determine compliance with regulatory requirements. If the FDA finds that we have failed to comply, the agency can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions which may materially affect our business operations.\nWe are subject to inspection and market surveillance by the FDA to determine compliance with regulatory requirements. If the FDA finds that we have failed to comply, the agency can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as:\n\u25cf fines, injunctions and civil penalties;\n\u25cf recall, detention or seizure of our products;\n\u25cf the issuance of public notices or warnings;\n\u25cf operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u25cf refusing Akers\u2019 requests for a 510(k) clearance of new products;\n\u25cf withdrawing a 510(k) clearance already granted; and\n\u25cf criminal prosecution.\nOur failure to comply with applicable requirements could lead to an enforcement action that may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if we are able to commercialize our prospective or future product candidates, the products may not receive coverage or adequate reimbursement from third-party payors in the United States or in other countries in which we seek to commercialize such products, which could harm our business.\nOur ability to commercialize any product successfully will depend, in part, on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for such products will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers, and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, determine which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the healthcare industry is cost containment.\nGovernment authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Third-party payors may also seek additional clinical evidence, beyond the data required to obtain regulatory approval, demonstrating clinical benefits and value in specific patient populations before covering our products for those patients. We cannot be sure that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain regulatory approval. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain regulatory approval.\nWe may not have the resources to conduct clinical protocols sufficient to yield data suitable for publication in peer-reviewed journals and our inability to do so in the future could have an adverse effect on marketing our products effectively.\nIn order for our products targeted for use by hospital laboratory professionals and healthcare providers to be widely adopted, we would have to conduct clinical protocols that are designed to yield data suitable for publication in peer-reviewed journals. These studies are often time-consuming, labor-intensive and expensive to execute. We have not previously had the resources to effectively implement such clinical programs within our clinical development activities and may not be able to do so in the future. In addition, if a protocol is initiated, the results of such protocol may ultimately not support the anticipated positioning and benefit proposition for the product. Either of these scenarios could hinder our ability to market our products, and revenue may decline.\nWe may experience delays in any phase of the pre-clinical or clinical development of a product, including during its research and development.\nThe completion of any of these studies may be delayed or halted for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf the FDA or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical study protocol or place a clinical study on hold;\n\u25cf patients do not enroll in a clinical study or results from patients are not received at the expected rate;\n\u25cf patients discontinue participation in a clinical study prior to the scheduled endpoint at a higher than expected rate;\n\u25cf patients experience adverse events from a product we develop;\n\u25cf third-party clinical investigators do not perform the studies in accordance with the anticipated schedule or consistent with the study protocol and GCPs or other third-party organizations do not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u25cf third-party clinical investigators engage in activities that, even if not directly associated with our studies, result in their debarment, loss of licensure, or other legal or regulatory sanctions;\n\u25cf regulatory inspections of manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend the pre-clinical or clinical studies;\n\u25cf changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions;\n\u25cf the interim results of the pre-clinical or clinical study, if any, are inconclusive or negative; and\n\u25cf the study design, although approved and completed, is inadequate to demonstrate effectiveness and safety.\nIf the pre-clinical and clinical studies that we are required to conduct to gain regulatory approval are delayed or unsuccessful, we may not be able to market any product that we develop in the future. Pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are expensive and difficult to design and implement and any delays or prolongment in our pre-clinical and clinical studies will require additional capital. There is no assurance that we will be able to acquire additional capital to support our studies. The failure to obtain additional capital would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe anticipate that we will rely completely on third parties to manufacture certain pre-clinical and all clinical drug supplies. Our business could be harmed if those third parties fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of drug product or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices.\nWe do not currently have, nor do we plan to acquire, the infrastructure or capability internally to manufacture our pre-clinical and clinical drug supplies for use in the conduct of our clinical studies, and we lack the resources and the capability to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. In order to develop products, apply for regulatory approvals and commercialize our products, we will need to develop, contract for, or otherwise arrange for access to the necessary manufacturing capabilities. We anticipate that we will rely on CMOs, or contract manufacturing organizations, and other third party contractors, some of whom may have limited cGMP experience, to manufacture formulations and produce larger scale amounts of drug substance and the drug product required for any clinical trials that we initiate.\nThe manufacturing process for any vaccine candidate is subject to the FDA and foreign regulatory authority approval process, and we will need to contract with manufacturers who can meet all applicable FDA and foreign regulatory authority requirements on an ongoing basis. In addition, if we receive the necessary regulatory approval for any product candidate, we also expect to rely on third parties to produce materials required for commercial supply. We may experience difficulty in obtaining adequate manufacturing capacity for our needs. Furthermore, it is our responsibility to ensure that all of our third-party contractors meet cGMP laws, regulations and guidance. Due to their failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may face fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension or delay in product approval, product seizure or recall, or withdrawal of product approval. These actions could have a material impact on the availability of products. If we are unable to obtain or maintain contract manufacturing for these product candidates, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize our products.\nTo the extent that we enter into manufacturing arrangements with third parties, we will depend on these third parties to perform their obligations in a timely manner and consistent with regulatory requirements, including those related to quality control and quality assurance. The failure of a third-party manufacturer to perform its obligations as expected could adversely affect our business in a number of ways, including:\n\u25cf we may not be able to initiate or continue pre-clinical and clinical trials of products that are under development;\n\u25cf we may need to repeat pivotal clinical trials;\n\u25cf we may be delayed in submitting regulatory applications, or receiving regulatory approvals, for our product candidates;\n\u25cf we may lose the cooperation of its collaborators;\n\u25cf our products could be the subject of inspections by regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf we may be required to cease distribution or recall some or all batches of our products; and\n\u25cf ultimately, we may not be able to meet commercial demands for our products.\nIf a third-party manufacturer with whom we contract fails to perform its obligations, we may be forced to seek out one or more other third-party manufacturers to manufacture our pre-clinical and/or clinical trial materials, which could cause delays in the FDA approval process. Further, should the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate be approved for marketing by the FDA, a change in a third-party manufacturer could cause significant delays to meeting the demand of patients. In some cases, the technical skills required to manufacture our product may be unique to the original manufacturer and we may have difficulty transferring such skills to a back-up or alternate manufacturer, or we may be unable to transfer such skills at all. In addition, if we are required to change manufacturers for any reason, we will be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines. We will also be required to demonstrate that the newly manufactured material is the same or similar to the previously manufactured material, or we may need to repeat clinical trials with the newly manufactured material. The delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer could negatively affect our ability to develop product candidates in a timely manner or within budget. Furthermore, a manufacturer may possess technology related to the manufacture of our product candidate that such manufacturer owns independently, which would increase our reliance on such manufacturer or require us to obtain a license from such manufacturer in order to have another third party manufacture our products.\nWe intend to rely on third parties to conduct our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials and perform other tasks for us. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines, or comply with regulatory requirements, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be substantially harmed.\nWe plan to rely upon third-party contract research organizations, or CROs, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to monitor and manage data for our licensed ongoing pre-clinical and clinical programs. We expect to continue to rely on these parties for execution of our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, and we control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we maintain responsibility for ensuring that each of our clinical trials and pre-clinical studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory, and scientific standards and our reliance on these third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs and other vendors are required to comply with cGMP, current GCP, and current GLPs, which are a collection of laws and regulations enforced by the FDA or comparable foreign authorities for all of our product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these regulations through periodic inspections of manufacturing facilities, pre-clinical study and clinical trial sponsors, principal investigators, preclinical study and clinical trial sites, and other contractors. If we or any of our CROs or vendors fails to comply with applicable regulations, the data generated in our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign authorities may require us to perform additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with products manufactured consistently with cGMP regulations. Failure by us or our third party CROs to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the development and regulatory approval processes.\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party CROs, medical institutions, clinical investigators or contract laboratories terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, our CROs are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such CROs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing pre-clinical and clinical programs. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, or comply with current GCP laws, regulations and guidance, or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our protocols, regulatory requirements, or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. CROs may also generate higher costs than anticipated. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates could be materially and adversely affected, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.\nSwitching or adding additional CROs, medical institutions, clinical investigators or contract laboratories involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work replacing a previous CRO. As a result, delays occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines.\nWe are opportunistically reviewing strategic transactions and there can be no assurance that any such strategic transaction we pursue will result in additional value for our stockholders. As a result, the makeup of our lines of business may change.\nWe are assessing alternate ways to generate value for shareholders, including reviewing opportunities that may lead to acquisitions, dispositions, business combinations or other strategic transactions. Strategies we may employ include seeking new or expanding existing specialty market niches, expanding our presence, acquiring businesses complementary to existing strengths and continually evaluating the performance and strategic fit of our existing business units. As a result, the makeup of our lines of business is subject to change. For example, as previously disclosed, in light of the unfavorable factors persistent in our rapid, point-of-care screening and testing product business and the progress we have made in its partnership with Premas, we conducted a strategic review of the screening and testing products business. Following such review, in early July 2020, we ceased the production and sale of our rapid, point-of-care screening and testing products. In connection with the discontinuation of its existing product line, we decided to close the facility located in Thorofare, New Jersey (the \u201cThorofare Facility\u201d), which previously housed our manufacturing, operations and support personnel, and terminated the lease (the \u201cThorofare Lease\u201d) on November 30, 2020. Furthermore, on November 11, 2020, we entered into the Merger Agreement with MYMD. For risks related to the Merger, please see risks set forth under the heading \u201c- Risks Related to the Proposed Merger\u201d herein. However, there can be no assurance that our pursuit of such strategic alternatives will result in any transaction or other alternatives.\nTo the extent we engage in other strategic transactions, the process may be time consuming and disruptive to our business operations and, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We could incur substantial expenses associated with evaluating and negotiating potential strategic alternatives. Furthermore, our ability to effectively integrate any future acquisitions or mergers will depend on, among other things, our ability to integrate businesses, the adequacy of our implementation plans, the ability of our management to oversee and operate effectively the combined operations and our ability to achieve desired operational efficiencies. If we are unable to successfully integrate the operations of any businesses that we may acquire in the future, our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that any potential transaction, if consummated, will provide greater value to our stockholders than that reflected in the current price of our common stock.\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate them into our business, our business could be harmed.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may acquire other companies or businesses. However, we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business and negatively affect our operating results, including:\n\u25cf difficulties in integrating the technologies, operations, existing contracts and personnel of an acquired company;\n\u25cf difficulties in supporting and transitioning clients and suppliers, if any, of an acquired company;\n\u25cf diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition opportunities;\n\u25cf failure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction;\n\u25cf failure to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, or employee or client issues;\n\u25cf risks of entering new markets in which we have limited or no experience;\n\u25cf potential loss of key employees, clients, vendors and suppliers from either our current business or an acquired company\u2019s business;\n\u25cf inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs;\n\u25cf additional costs or equity dilution associated with funding the acquisition; and\n\u25cf possible write-offs or impairment charges relating to acquired businesses.\nThe use of our PIFA products could result in serious injuries, product liability claims, regulatory enforcement action, and/or recalls or market withdrawals, any of which would likely subject us to substantial costs and reputational harm and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn July 2020, we ceased the production and sale of its rapid, point-of-care screening and testing products. We will continue to provide support for these testing products that remain in the market through their respective product expiration dates. We believe that the users of our PIFA products are likely to be particularly sensitive to test defects and errors, as the conditions that the PIFA products are designed to identify may cause limb- and life-threatening complications if not accurately diagnosed in a timely manner. As a result, the failure of our tests or services to perform as expected could subject us to legal claims arising from any defects or errors.\nThe use of our PIFA products and our other products could lead to product liability (and other similar) claims against us if someone were to allege that one of our tests failed to perform as it was designed or as claimed in our promotional materials, was performed pursuant to incorrect or inadequate laboratory procedures, if we delivered incorrect or incomplete test results, or if someone were to misinterpret test results. In addition, we may be subject to liability for errors in, a misunderstanding of, or inappropriate reliance upon, the information we provide, or for failure to provide such information, in connection with the results generated by our products. A product liability or professional liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time-consuming for us to defend.\nOur PIFA products are not 100% accurate and may generate erroneous results that could cause patient harm. For example, PIFA could provide a so-called \u201cfalse negative\u201d result upon which a patient or physician may rely to make a conclusion about how to proceed with the patient\u2019s treatment. If the false negative causes, or exacerbates, a patient injury or condition, the patient (and/or the patient\u2019s family) may file a lawsuit against us based on product liability.\nAny product liability or professional liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our insurance rates, cause our insurance coverage to be terminated or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future.\nFurther, under the FDA\u2019s Medical Device Regulations, we are required to report to the FDA any incident in which its product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which our product malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. Repeated product malfunctions may result in a voluntary or involuntary product recall, which could divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and operating results.\nAny adverse event involving our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or regulatory agency action, which could include inspection, mandatory recall or other enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nIf we market products or interact with health care practitioners in a manner that violates healthcare fraud or abuse laws, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs.\nIf we receive payments directly from or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other national or third-party payers for its products, United States federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud or abuse will be applicable to our business. We are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation by the United States federal government and the states in which we conduct our business.\nThe laws that may affect our ability to operate include the AKS, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, the purchase, lease or order, or arrangement for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute applies to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor.\nFederal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product, reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates, engaging in off-label promotion that caused claims to be submitted to Medicaid for non-covered off-label uses and submitting inflated best price information to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.\nHIPAA also created prohibitions against healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payers. The false statements statute immediately noted above prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.\nIn addition, there has been a trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians. The ACA, through the PPSA, imposed new requirements on manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) information related to payments or other \u201ctransfers of value\u201d made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members and payments or other \u201ctransfers of value\u201d to such physician owners and their immediate family members. Manufacturers are required to report such data to the government by the 90th calendar day of each year.\nThe majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to these federal laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. In addition, some states have laws that require pharmaceutical companies to adopt comprehensive compliance programs. For example, under California law, pharmaceutical companies must comply with both the April 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and the PhRMA Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals, as amended. Moreover, certain states mandate the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration paid by us to physicians and other healthcare providers.\nAlthough compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, cause reputational harm and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable U.S. federal and state laws may prove costly.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of its third-party vendors, collaborators, or other contractors may be subject to various federal and state confidentiality and privacy laws in the United States and abroad and could sustain system failures, security breaches, or other disruptions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nNumerous international, national, federal, provincial and state laws, including state privacy laws (such as the California Consumer Privacy Act), state security breach notification and information security laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws govern the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information. In addition, most healthcare providers who may, in the future, prescribe and dispense our products in the United States and research institutions in the United States with whom we may collaborate in the future are \u201ccovered entities\u201d subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA\u2019s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors, or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. We could be subject to a wide range of penalties and sanctions under HIPAA, including criminal penalties if we, our affiliates, or our agents knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. Failure to comply with applicable HIPAA requirements or other current and future privacy laws and regulations could result in governmental enforcement actions (including the imposition of significant penalties), criminal and civil liability, and/or adverse publicity that negatively affects our business.\nMoreover, we rely on our internal and third-party provided information technology systems and applications to support our operations and to maintain and process company information including personal information, confidential business information and proprietary information. If these information technology systems are subject to cybersecurity attacks, or are otherwise compromised, due to cyberattacks, human error or malfeasance, system errors or otherwise, it may adversely impact our business, disrupt our operations, or lead to the loss, theft, destruction, corruption, or compromise of our information or that of our collaborators, study subjects, or other third-party contractors, as applicable. Such information technology or security events could also lead to legal liability, regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, loss of business, negative media coverage, and reputational damage. While we seek to protect our information technology systems from these types of incidents, the healthcare sector continues to see a high frequency of cyberattacks and increasingly sophisticated threat actors, and our systems and the information maintained within those systems remain potentially vulnerable to data security incidents.\nAny of the above-described cyber or other security-related incidents may trigger notification obligations to affected individuals and government agencies, legal claims or proceedings, and liability under foreign, federal, provincial and state laws that protect the privacy and security of personal information. Our proprietary and confidential information may also be accessed. Any one of these events could cause our business to be materially harmed and our results of operations may be adversely impacted. Finally, as cyber threats continue to evolve, and privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations continue to develop, we may need to invest additional resources to implement new compliance measures, strengthen our information security posture, or respond to cyber threats and incidents.\nWe may fail to retain qualified personnel.\nWe have substantially reduced the number of our employees in order to reduce our costs. Accordingly, retaining our remaining personnel in the future will be critical to our success. If we fail to retain and motivate these highly skilled personnel, we may be unable to continue our operating activities, and this could have a material adverse effect or our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe rely on the key executive officers of the management team.\nWe are dependent on our management team to execute against our business plan. Failure could result in delays in product development, loss of customers and sales and diversion of management resources, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nExpenses incurred with respect to monitoring, protecting, and defending our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.\nCompetitors and others may infringe on our intellectual property rights, or may allege that we have infringed on theirs. Monitoring infringement and misappropriation of intellectual property can be difficult and expensive, and we may not be able to detect infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights and we may be unable to protect our rights to, or use of, our technology.\nSome or all of our patent applications may not result in the issue of patents, or the claims of any issued patents may not afford meaningful protection for our technologies or products. In addition, patents issued to us or our licensors, if any, may be challenged and subsequently narrowed, invalidated, found unenforceable or circumvented. Patent litigation is widespread in the biotechnology industry and could harm our business. Litigation might be necessary to protect our patent position. Patentability, invalidity, freedom-to-operate or other opinions may be required to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. If we choose to go to court to stop a third party from using the inventions protected by our patent, that third party would have the right to ask the court to rule that such patents are invalid and/or should not be enforced against that third party. These lawsuits are expensive and we may not have the required resources to pursue such litigation or to protect our patent rights. In addition, there is a risk that the court will decide that our patents are not valid or that we cannot stop the other party from using their inventions. There is also the risk that, even if the validity of these patents is upheld, the court will find that the third party\u2019s activities do not infringe our rights in these patents.\nFurthermore, a third party may claim that we are infringing the third party\u2019s patent rights and may go to court to stop us from engaging in its normal operations and activities, including making or selling our products or product candidates. These lawsuits are costly and could affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and technical personnel. There is a risk that a court would decide that we are infringing the third party\u2019s patents and would order us to stop the activities covered by the patents. In addition, there is a risk that a court will order us to pay the other party\u2019s treble damages or attorneys\u2019 fees for having violated the other party\u2019s patents. The biotechnology industry has produced a proliferation of patents, and it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products or methods of use either do not infringe the claims of the relevant patent and/or that the third-party patent claims are invalid, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity in the United Sates is difficult since it requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents.\nIn addition, changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may materially diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we have no knowledge of any claims against us, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. To date, none of our employees have been subject to such claims.\nWe may be at risk that our former employees may wrongfully use or disclose our trade secrets.\nIn addition to patent protection, we rely heavily upon know-how and trade secret protection, as well as non-disclosure agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, and third parties, to protect our confidential and proprietary information, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. In addition to contractual measures, we try to protect the confidential nature of our proprietary information using physical and technological security measures. Such measures may not, for example, in the case of misappropriation of a trade secret by an employee, former employee, consultant, former consultant or third party with authorized access, provide adequate protection for our proprietary information. Our security measures may not prevent an employee or consultant from misappropriating our trade secrets and providing them to a competitor, and recourse we take against such misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to protect our interests fully. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret can be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, trade secrets may be independently developed by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by us. If any of our confidential or proprietary information, such as our trade secrets, were to be disclosed or misappropriated, or if any such information was independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position could be harmed.\nWe are subject to various internal control reporting requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We can provide no assurance that we will at all times in the future be able to report that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with Section 404. In any given year, we cannot be certain as to the time of completion of our internal control evaluation, testing and remediation actions or of their impact on our operations. Upon completion of this process, we may identify control deficiencies of varying degrees of severity under applicable SEC and Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) rules and regulations. Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, in us have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving our stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions, such as growth of the company or increased transaction volume, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nIn addition, as a public company, we are required to report, among other things, control deficiencies that constitute material weaknesses or changes in internal controls that, or that are reasonably likely to, materially affect internal controls over financial reporting. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. If we fail to comply with the requirements of Section 404 or if we report a material weakness, we might be subject to regulatory sanction and investors may lose confidence in our consolidated financial statements, which may be inaccurate if we fail to remedy such material weakness.\nWe incur increased costs and demands on management as a result of compliance with laws and regulations applicable to public companies, which could harm our operating results.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq, impose a number of requirements on public companies, including with respect to corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance and disclosure obligations. Moreover, compliance with these rules and regulations has increased our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs and has made some activities more time-consuming and costly. It is also more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe expect to require additional capital in the future in order to develop the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate. If we do not obtain any such additional financing, it may be difficult to complete development of the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate or effectively realize our long-term strategic goals and objectives.\nOur current cash resources will not be sufficient to fund the development of the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate through all of the required clinical trials to receive regulatory approval and commercialization. While we do not currently have an estimate of all of the costs that we will incur in the development of the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate, we anticipate that we will need to raise significant additional funds in order to continue the development of the COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate during the next 12-months. If we cannot secure this additional funding when such funds are required, we may fail to develop a COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate or be forced to forego certain strategic opportunities.\nAny additional capital raised through the sale of equity or equity-backed securities may dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership percentages and could also result in a decrease in the market value of our equity securities.\nThe terms of any securities issued by us in future capital transactions may be more favorable to new investors, and may include preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have a further dilutive effect on the holders of any of our securities then outstanding.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which may adversely impact our financial condition.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile, and your investment in our common stock could decline in value.\nThe stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. The market prices of the securities of biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies, particularly companies like ours without product revenues and earnings, have been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future. This volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:\n\u25cf announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf announcement of FDA approval or disapproval of our product candidates or other product-related actions;\n\u25cf developments involving our discovery efforts and clinical studies;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights, including announcements of infringement, interference or other litigation against us or our potential licensees;\n\u25cf announcements concerning our competitors, or the biotechnology, pharmaceutical or drug delivery industry in general;\n\u25cf public concerns as to the safety or efficacy of our products or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u25cf changes in government regulation of the pharmaceutical or medical industry;\n\u25cf changes in the reimbursement policies of third party insurance companies or government agencies;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf developments involving corporate collaborators, if any;\n\u25cf changes in accounting principles; and\n\u25cf the loss of any of our key scientific or management personnel.\nMoreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant financial market volatility and uncertainty in recent weeks. A continuation or worsening of the levels of market disruption and volatility seen in the recent past could have an adverse effect on our ability to access capital, on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and on the market price of our common stock.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies that experience volatility in the market price of their securities. Whether or not meritorious, litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq could result in a delisting of our common stock. The delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and the market price of our common stock could decrease.\nOur common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. In order to maintain our listing, we must meet minimum financial and other requirements, including requirements for a minimum amount of capital and a minimum price per share. We cannot assure you that we will continue to meet the continued listing requirements in the future.\nIf Nasdaq delists our common stock from trading on its exchange, due to failure to meet its continued listing requirements, and we are not able to list our common stock on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for our common stock;\n\u25cf reduced liquidity for our common stock;\n\u25cf a determination that our common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our common stock;\n\u25cf a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nIf we sell shares of our common stock in future financings, stockholders may experience immediate dilution and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nWe may from time to time issue additional shares of common stock at a discount from the current market price of our common stock. As a result, our stockholders would experience immediate dilution upon the purchase of any shares of our common stock sold at such discount. As opportunities present themselves, we may enter into financing or similar arrangements in the future, including the issuance of debt securities, preferred stock or common stock. If we issue common stock or securities convertible or exercisable into common stock, our common stockholders would experience additional dilution and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock and, accordingly, stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and limitations under applicable law, and will depend on various factors, including our operating results, financial condition, future prospects and any other factors deemed relevant our board of directors. You should not rely on an investment in us if you require dividend income from your investment in us. The success of your investment will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation of the market price of our common stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception that future sales may occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline, even if our business is doing well.\nSales by our stockholders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur in the future. Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement for the Private Placement (the \u201cPrivate Placement SPA\u201d), we are required to file a registration statement for the resale of 9,765,933 shares of common stock issued at an offering price of $1.85 per share or, at the election of each investor, Pre-Funded Warrants, and up to 9,765,933 shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of the Pre-Funded Warrants shortly after we file a proxy statement with the SEC in connection with the Merger. Following their registration and resale under a registration statement, such shares would become freely tradable. Sales by our stockholders of a substantial number or resales by the purchasers of such shares and shares issuable upon exercise of such warrants pursuant to a registration statement, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares of common stock may or intend to sell their shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise desire.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe are currently subject to a number of securities litigations, and we may be subject to similar or other litigation in the future.\nWe are currently subject to a number of litigations as described elsewhere in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. In connection with certain of these litigations, we have entered into settlements of claims for significant monetary damages. We may also be subject to judgements or enter into additional settlements of claims for significant monetary damages for the securities litigations that we have yet to enter into settlement agreements. Defending against the current litigations is or can be time-consuming, expensive and cause diversion of our management\u2019s attention.\nCompanies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have frequently been the objects of securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Class action and derivative lawsuits could result in substantial costs to us and cause a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nWith respect to any litigation, our insurance may not reimburse us, or may not be sufficient to reimburse us, for the expenses or losses we may suffer in contesting and concluding such lawsuit. Substantial litigation costs, including the substantial self-insured retention that we are required to satisfy before any insurance applies to a claim, unreimbursed legal fees or an adverse result in any litigation may adversely impact our business, operating results or financial condition. We believe that our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance will cover our potential liability with respect to any securities class-action lawsuit; however, the insurer has reserved its rights to contest the applicability of the insurance to such claims and the limits of the insurance may be insufficient to cover any eventual liability.", "PERMNO": 14419, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "AKER"}
