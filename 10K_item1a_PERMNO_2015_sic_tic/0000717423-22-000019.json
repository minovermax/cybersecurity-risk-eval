{"cik": "717423", "company": "MURPHY OIL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe Company faces risks in the normal course of business and through global, regional, and local events that could have an adverse impact on its reputation, operations, and financial performance. The Board of Directors exercises oversight of the Company\u2019s enterprise risk management program, which includes strategic, operational and financial matters, as well as compliance and legal risks. The Board of Directors receives updates annually on the risk management processes.\nThe following are some important factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. If any of the events or circumstances described in any of the following risk factors occurs, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected, and our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in any forward-looking statements we make in any public disclosures.\nPrice Risk Factors\nVolatility in the global prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas can significantly affect the Company\u2019s operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nAmong the most significant variable factors impacting the Company\u2019s results of operations are the sales prices for crude oil and natural gas that it produces. Many of the factors influencing prices of crude oil and natural gas are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022the occurrence or threat of epidemics or pandemics, such as the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), or any government response to such occurrence or threat which may lower the demand for hydrocarbon fuels;\n\u2022worldwide and domestic supplies of, and demand for, crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas;\n\u2022the ability of the members of OPEC and certain non-OPEC members, for example, Russia, to agree to and maintain production levels;\n\u2022the production levels of non-OPEC countries, including, amongst others, production levels in the shale plays in the United States;\n\u2022the level of drilling, completion and production activities by other exploration and production companies, and variability therein, in response to market conditions;\n\u2022political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions;\n\u2022changes in weather patterns and climate, including as a result of climate change;\n\u2022natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes, including as a result of climate change;\n\u2022the price, availability and the demand for and of alternative and competing forms of energy, such as nuclear, hydroelectric, wind or solar;\n\u2022the effect of conservation efforts and focus on climate-change;\n\u2022technological advances affecting energy consumption and energy supply;\n\u2022increased activism against, or change in public sentiment for, oil and gas exploration, development, and production activities and considerations including climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy;\n\u2022domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes, including further legislation requiring, subsidizing or providing tax benefits for the use of alternative energy sources and fuels; and\n\u2022general economic conditions worldwide.\nPART I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nIn 2021, a combination of the global availability of vaccines and a relaxation of certain government-imposed lockdowns in response to the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to an improving global economic outlook and subsequently increased demand for oil and gas. Several COVID-19 variants, such as Delta and Omicron, temporarily created uncertainty in the outlook; however, vaccines remained effective and therefore demand for oil and gas has remained resilient in the second half of 2021 and early 2022. The demand resilience has revealed an oil supply shortage, and hence is applying upward pressure to current and future oil and gas prices in early 2022.\nThe OPEC+ group of oil producing countries (OPEC+) continues to target increasing supply by 0.4 million barrels per day (bpd) a month, with aims to fully phase out prior cuts by September 2022, at the current rate of OPEC+ supply increases. In 2020, OPEC+ cut production by 10 million bpd following the COVID-19 demand reduction. It has gradually reinstated supply so that the curtailments were approximately 5.8 million bpd at the end of 2021. However, some members of the OPEC+ are not meeting their commitments to reinstate supply..\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices averaged $68 per barrel in 2021, compared to $39 in 2020, $57 in 2019, and $65 in 2018. The closing price for WTI at the end of 2021 was $72 per barrel, reflecting a 52% increase from the price at the end of 2020. As of close on February 24, 2022, the NYMEX WTI forward curve price for the remainder of 2022 and 2023 were $86.31 and $77.72 per barrel, respectively. The current futures forward curve indicates that prices may continue at or near current prices for an extended time. Certain U.S. and Canadian crude oils are priced from oil indices other than WTI, and these indices are influenced by different supply and demand forces than those that affect WTI prices. The most common crude oil indices used to price the Company\u2019s crude include WTI Houston (MEH), Heavy Louisiana Sweet (HLS), Mars and Brent.\nThe average New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas sales price was $3.84 per million British Thermal Units (MMBTU) in 2021, compared to $1.99 in 2020, $2.52 in 2019, and $3.12 in 2018. The closing price for NYMEX natural gas as of December 31, 2021 was $3.72 per MMBTU. The Company also has some limited exposure to the Canadian benchmark natural gas price, AECO, which averaged US$2.89 per MMBTU in 2021. The closing price for AECO as of December 31, 2021 was US$3.20 per MMBTU. The Company has entered into certain forward fixed price contracts as detailed in the Outlook section on page 54 and certain variable netback contracts providing exposure to Malin, Dawn and other locations.\nLower prices, should they occur, will materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Lower oil and natural gas prices could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that the Company can economically produce, resulting in a reduction in the proved oil and natural gas reserves we could recognize, which could impact the recoverability and carrying value of our assets. The Company cannot predict how changes in the sales prices of oil and natural gas will affect the results of operations in future periods. The Company has hedged a portion of its exposure to the effects of changing prices of crude oil and natural gas by selling forwards, swaps and other forms of derivative contracts.\nLower oil and natural gas prices adversely affect the Company in several ways:\n\u2022Lower sales value for the Company\u2019s oil and natural gas production reduces cash flows and net income.\n\u2022Lower cash flows may cause the Company to reduce its capital expenditure program, thereby potentially restricting its ability to grow production and add proved reserves.\n\u2022Lower oil and natural gas prices could lead to impairment charges in future periods, therefore reducing net income.\n\u2022Reductions in oil and natural gas prices could lead to reductions in the Company\u2019s proved reserves in future years. Low prices could make a portion of the Company\u2019s proved reserves uneconomic, which in turn could lead to the removal of certain of the Company\u2019s year-end reported proved oil reserves in future periods. These reserve reductions could be significant.\n\u2022In order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements, we maintain appropriate bank credit facilities. Inability, as a result of low oil and gas prices, to access, renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity.\nPART I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\n\u2022Lower prices for oil and natural gas could cause the Company to lower its dividend because of lower cash flows.\nSee Note L - Financial Instruments and Risk Management for additional information on the derivative instruments used to manage certain risks related to commodity prices.\nMurphy\u2019s commodity price risk management may limit the Company\u2019s ability to fully benefit from potential future price increases for oil and natural gas.\nThe Company, from time to time, enters into various contracts to protect its cash flows against lower oil and natural gas prices. Because of these contracts, if the prices for oil and natural gas increase in future periods, the Company will not fully benefit from the price improvement on all production.\nIn 2021, the Company entered into collar contracts. Under the collar contracts, which also mature monthly, the Company purchased put options and sold call options with no net premiums paid to or received from counterparties. Upon maturity, collar contracts require payments by the Company if the NYMEX average closing price is above the ceiling price or payments to the Company if the NYMEX average closing price is below the floor price.\nSee Note L - Financial Instruments and Risk Management for additional information on the derivative instruments used to manage certain risks related to commodity prices.\nOperational Risk Factors\nMurphy operates in highly competitive environments which could adversely affect it in many ways, including its profitability, cash flows and its ability to grow.\nMurphy operates in the oil and natural gas industry and experiences competition from other oil and natural gas companies, which include major integrated oil companies, private equity investors and independent producers of oil and natural gas, and state-owned foreign oil companies. Many of the major integrated and state-owned oil companies and some of the independent producers that compete with the Company have substantially greater resources than Murphy.\nIn addition, the oil industry as a whole competes with other industries in supplying energy requirements around the world. Within the industry, Murphy competes for, among other things, valuable acreage positions, exploration licenses, drilling equipment and talent.\nExploration drilling results can significantly affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company drills exploratory wells which subjects its exploration and production operating results to exposure to dry hole expense, which may have adverse effects on, and create volatility for, the Company\u2019s results of operations. The Company\u2019s strategy is to participate in three to five exploration wells per year. In 2021, the Company drilled a successful exploration well in Brunei (Jagus Subthrust) and participated in one unsuccessful (non-commercial) well in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The Cutthroat well in Brazil, originally planned for 2021, will now be drilled in early 2022 due to permitting delays. The Company has budgeted $75 million for its 2022 exploration program, which includes the Cutthroat well in Brazil, the operated well in Mexico (Tulum), as well as a non-operated well in Brunei.\nIf Murphy cannot replace its oil and natural gas reserves, it may not be able to sustain or grow its business.\nMurphy continually depletes its oil and natural gas reserves as production occurs. To sustain and grow its business, the Company must successfully replace the oil and natural gas it produces with additional reserves. Therefore, it must create and maintain a portfolio of good prospects for future reserves additions and production. The Company does this by obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce hydrocarbons in prospective areas. In addition, it must find, develop and produce (and/or acquire) reserves at a competitive cost to be successful in the long-term. Murphy\u2019s ability to operate profitably in the exploration and production business, therefore, is dependent on its ability to find (and/or acquire), develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves at costs that are less than the realized sales price for these products.\nPART I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nMurphy\u2019s proved reserves are based on the professional judgment of its engineers and may be subject to revision.\nProved reserves of crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGL) and natural gas included in this report on pages 110 through 119 have been prepared according to the Securities and Exchange (SEC) guidelines by qualified Company personnel or qualified independent engineers based on an unweighted average of crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices in effect at the beginning of each month of the respective year as well as other conditions and information available at the time the estimates were prepared. Estimation of reserves is a subjective process that involves professional judgment by engineers about volumes to be recovered in future periods from underground oil and natural gas reservoirs. Estimates of economically recoverable crude oil, NGL and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, and consequently, different engineers could arrive at different estimates of reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data and using industry accepted engineering practices and scientific methods. In 2021, 93.2% of the Proved reserves were audited by third-party auditors.\nMurphy\u2019s actual future oil and natural gas production may vary substantially from its reported quantity of proved reserves due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022Oil and natural gas prices which are materially different from prices used to compute proved reserves,\n\u2022Operating and/or capital costs which are materially different from those assumed to compute proved reserves,\n\u2022Future reservoir performance which is materially different from models used to compute proved reserves, and\n\u2022Governmental regulations or actions which materially impact operations of a field.\nThe Company\u2019s proved undeveloped reserves represent significant portions of total proved reserves. As of December 31, 2021, and including noncontrolling interests, approximately 34% of the Company\u2019s crude oil and condensate proved reserves, 26% of natural gas liquids proved reserves and 49% of natural gas proved reserves are undeveloped. The ability of the Company to reclassify these undeveloped proved reserves to the proved developed classification is generally dependent on the successful completion of one or more operations, which might include further development drilling, construction of facilities or pipelines, and well workovers.\nThe discounted future net revenues from our proved reserves as reported on pages 124 and 125 should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties. As required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the estimated discounted future net revenues from our proved reserves are based on an unweighted average of the oil and natural gas prices in effect at the beginning of each month during the year. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than those used in the reserves computations.\nIn addition, the 10% discount factor that is required to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes under GAAP is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital, the risks associated with our business and the risk associated with the industry in general.\nMurphy is sometimes reliant on joint venture partners for operating assets, and/or funding development projects and operations.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s major oil and natural gas producing properties are operated by others. Therefore, Murphy does not fully control all activities at certain of its revenue generating properties. During 2021, approximately 24% of the Company\u2019s total production was at fields operated by others, while at December 31, 2021, approximately 15% of the Company\u2019s total proved reserves were at fields operated by others.\nAdditionally, the Company relies on the availability of transportation and processing facilities that are often owned and operated by others. These third-party systems and facilities may not always be available to the Company, and if available, may not be available at a price that is acceptable to the Company.\nPART I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nSome of Murphy\u2019s development projects entail significant capital expenditures and have long development cycle times. As a result, the Company\u2019s partners must be able to fund their share of investment costs through the development cycle, through cash flow from operations, external credit facilities, or other sources, including financing arrangements. Murphy\u2019s partners are also susceptible to certain of the risk factors noted herein, including, but not limited to, commodity price, fiscal regime changes, government project approval delays, regulatory changes, credit downgrades and regional conflict. If one or more of these factors negatively impacts a project partners\u2019 cash flows or ability to obtain adequate financing, it could result in a delay or cancellation of a project, resulting in a reduction of the Company\u2019s reserves and production, which negatively impacts the timing and receipt of planned cash flows and expected profitability.\nMurphy\u2019s business is subject to operational hazards, physical security risks and risks normally associated with the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, which could become more significant as a result of climate change.\nThe Company operates in urban and remote, and sometimes inhospitable, areas around the world. The occurrence of an event, including but not limited to acts of nature such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes (and other forms of severe weather), mechanical equipment failures, industrial accidents, fires, explosions, acts of war, civil unrest, piracy and acts of terrorism could result in the loss of hydrocarbons and associated revenues, environmental pollution or contamination, personal injury, (including death), and property damages for which the Company could be deemed to be liable and which could subject the Company to substantial fines and/or claims for punitive damages. This risk extends to actions and operational hazards of other operators in the industry, which may also impact the Company.\nThe location of many of Murphy\u2019s key assets causes the Company to be vulnerable to severe weather, including hurricanes and tropical storms. Many of the Company\u2019s offshore fields are in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where hurricanes and tropical storms can lead to shutdowns and damages. The U.S. hurricane season runs from June through November. Moreover, it should be noted that scientists have predicted that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that increase significant weather events, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. If such effects were to occur, our operations could be adversely affected. Although the Company maintains insurance for such risks as described elsewhere in this Form 10-K report, due to policy deductibles and possible coverage limits, weather-related risks are not fully insured.\nMurphy is subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and such existing and any potential future laws and regulations may result in material liabilities and costs.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to various international, foreign, national, state, provincial, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including related to the generation, storage, handling, use, disposal and remediation of petroleum products, wastewater and hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of such materials to the environment, including greenhouse gas emissions; wildlife, habitat and water protection; the placement, operation and decommissioning of production equipment; and the health and safety of our employees, contractors and communities where our operations are located. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and have tended to become stricter over time. They can impose permitting and financial assurance obligations, as well as operational controls and/or siting constraints on our business, and can result in additional capital and operating expenditures.\nMurphy also could be subject to strict liability for environmental contamination in various jurisdictions where it operates, including with respect to its current or former properties, operations and waste disposal sites, or those of its predecessors. Contamination has been identified at some locations, and the Company has been required, and in the future may be required, to investigate, remove or remediate previously disposed wastes; or otherwise clean up contaminated soil, surface water or groundwater, address spills and leaks from pipelines and production equipment, and perform remedial plugging operations. In addition to significant investigation and remediation costs, such matters can result in fines and also give rise to third-party claims for personal injury and property or other environmental damage.\nPART I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nIt is possible in the future certain regulatory bodies such as the Railroad Commission of Texas may enact regulation that bans or reduces flaring for US Onshore operations. Compliance with such regulations could result in capital investment which would reduce the Company\u2019s net cash flows and profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s onshore North America oil and natural gas production is dependent on a technique known as hydraulic fracturing whereby water, sand and certain chemicals are injected into deep oil and natural gas bearing reservoirs in North America. This process occurs thousands of feet below the surface and creates fractures in the rock formation within the reservoir which enhances migration of oil and natural gas to the wellbore. The Company primarily uses this technique in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas and in Western Canada. Texas law imposes permitting, disclosure, disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations, as well as public disclosure of certain information regarding the components used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Regulations in the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta also govern various aspects of hydraulic fracturing activities under their jurisdictions. It is possible that Texas, other states in which we may conduct fracturing in the future, the U.S., Canadian provinces and certain municipalities may adopt further laws or regulations which could render the process unlawful, less effective or drive up its costs. If any such action is taken in the future, the Company\u2019s production levels could be adversely affected, or its costs of drilling and completion could be increased. Once new laws and/or regulations have been enacted and adopted, the costs of compliance are appraised.\nHydraulic fracturing operations subject the Company to operational risks inherent in the drilling and production of oil and natural gas. These risks include underground migration or surface spillage due to releases of oil, natural gas, formation water or well fluids, as well as any related surface or groundwater contamination, including from petroleum constituents or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives. Ineffective containment of surface spillage and surface or groundwater contamination resulting from hydraulic fracturing operations, including from petroleum constituents or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives, could result in environmental pollution, remediation expenses and third-party claims alleging damages, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, hydraulic fracturing requires significant quantities of water; the wastewater from oil and natural gas operations is often disposed of through underground injection. Certain increased seismic activities have been linked to underground water injection. Any diminished access to water for use in the hydraulic fracturing process, any inability to properly dispose of wastewater, or any further restrictions placed on wastewater, could curtail the Company\u2019s operations or otherwise result in operational delays or increased costs.\nIn addition, BOEM and BSEE have regulations applicable to lessees in federal waters that impose various safety, permitting and certification requirements applicable to exploration, development and production activities in the Gulf of Mexico, and also require lessees to have substantial U.S. assets and net worth or post bonds or other acceptable financial assurance that the regulatory obligations will be met. These include, in the Gulf of Mexico, well design, well control, casing, cementing, real-time monitoring, and subsea containment, among other items. Under applicable requirements, BOEM evaluates the financial strength and reliability of lessees and operators active on the OCS. If the BOEM determines that a company does not have the financial ability to meet its decommissioning and other obligations, that company will be required to post additional financial security as assurance.\nIn addition, various executive orders by the current presidential administration and the Department of Interior over the course of 2021 regarding a temporary suspension of normal-course issuance of permits for fossil fuel development on federal lands and a pause on new oil and natural gas leases on public lands and offshore waters, and the Secretary of Interior\u2019s related review of permitting and leasing practices, could adversely impact Murphy\u2019s operations. For further details, see See \u201cRisk Factors - General Risk Factors - Murphy\u2019s operations and earnings have been and will continue to be affected by domestic and worldwide political developments.\u201d\nPART I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nWe face various risks associated with increased activism against, or change in public sentiment for, oil and gas exploration, development, and production activities and sustainability considerations, including climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy.\nOpposition toward oil and gas drilling, development, and production activity has been growing globally. Companies in the oil and gas industry are often the target of activist efforts from both individuals and non-governmental organizations and other stakeholders regarding safety, human rights, climate change, environmental matters, sustainability, and business practices. Anti-development activists are working to, among other things, delay or cancel certain operations such as offshore drilling and development.\nActivism may continue to increase regardless of whether the current presidential administration in the U.S. is perceived to be following, or actually follows, through on the current president\u2019s campaign commitments to promote decreased fossil fuel exploration and production in the U.S, including as a result of the administration\u2019s environmental and climate change executive orders described earlier in this 10-K. Our need to incur costs associated with responding to these initiatives or complying with any resulting new legal or regulatory requirements resulting from these activities that are substantial and not adequately provided for, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a change in public sentiment regarding the oil and gas industry could result in a reduction in the demand for our products or otherwise affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nFinancial Risk Factors\nCapital financing may not always be available to fund Murphy\u2019s activities; and interest rates could impact cash flows.\nMurphy usually must spend and risk a significant amount of capital to find and develop reserves before revenue is generated from production. Although most capital needs are funded from operating cash flow, the timing of cash flows from operations and capital funding requirements may not always coincide, and the levels of cash flow generated by operations may not fully cover capital funding requirements, especially in periods of low commodity prices. Therefore, the Company maintains financing arrangements with lending institutions to meet certain funding needs. The Company periodically renews these financing arrangements based on foreseeable financing needs or as they expire. In November 2018, the Company entered into a $1.6 billion revolving credit facility (the \u201cRCF\u201d). The RCF is a senior unsecured guaranteed facility and will expire in November 2023. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the RCF.\nHowever, in the event the RCF was drawn, amounts drawn under the RCF may bear interest in relation to 1-month, 2-month, 3-month and 6-month LIBOR, depending on our selection of rates. In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K. announced a desire to phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. Some USD LIBOR tenors (overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month) will continue to be published until June 30, 2023, but U.S. regulators have published guidance instructing banks to cease entering into new contracts referencing USD-LIBOR no later than December 31, 2021. While methodologies to transition existing agreements that depend on LIBOR as a reference rate are being developed, we can provide no assurance that market-accepted rates and transition methodologies will be available and finalized at the time of LIBOR cessation. If clear market standards and transition methodologies have not developed by the time LIBOR becomes unavailable, we may have difficulty reaching agreement on acceptable replacement rates under the RCF. If we are unable to negotiate replacement rates, on favorable terms, it could have an adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows.\nIn March 2020, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) and associated indices. However, SOFR is fundamentally different from USD LIBOR for two key reasons. First, SOFR is a secured rate, while LIBOR is an unsecured rate. Second, SOFR is an overnight rate, while USD LIBOR represents interbank funding over different maturities. As a result, there can be no assurance that SOFR will perform in the same way as LIBOR would have at any time, including, without limitation, as a result of changes in interest and yield rates in the market, market volatility or global or regional economic, financial, political, regulatory, judicial or other events. For example, since publication of SOFR began on April 3, 2018, daily changes in SOFR have, on occasion, been more volatile than daily changes in comparable benchmark or other market rates.\nPART I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nIn 2021, the Company undertook several actions to reduce overall debt. See Note G - Financing Arrangements and Debt for information regarding the Company\u2019s outstanding debt as of December 31, 2021.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing is affected by the Company\u2019s debt credit ratings and competition for available debt financing. A ratings downgrade could materially and adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to access debt markets, increase the borrowing cost under the Company\u2019s credit facility and the cost of future debt, and potentially require the Company to post additional letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain obligations.\nFurther, changes in economic environments and investors\u2019 view of risk of the exploration and production industry could adversely impact interest rates. This could result in higher interest costs on capital funding lowering net income and cash-flows. Murphy partially manages this risk through borrowing at fixed rates where-ever possible; however, rates determined when refinancing or new capital is required are partly determined through factors outside of Murphy\u2019s control, such as centrally (federal government) set interest rates and investors\u2019 view of the exploration and production industry.\nMurphy\u2019s operations could be adversely affected by changes in foreign exchange rates.\nThe Company\u2019s worldwide operational scope exposes it to risks associated with foreign currencies. Most of the Company\u2019s business is transacted in U.S. dollars, and therefore the Company and most of its subsidiaries are U.S. dollar functional entities for accounting purposes. However, the Canadian dollar is the functional currency for all Canadian operations. This exposure to currencies other than the U.S. dollar functional currency can lead to impacts on consolidated financial results from foreign currency translation. On occasions, the Canadian business may hold assets or incur liabilities denominated in a currency which is not Canadian dollars which could lead to exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. See also Note L - Financial Instruments and Risk Management in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on derivative contracts.\nThe costs and funding requirements related to the Company\u2019s retirement plans are affected by several factors.\nA number of actuarial assumptions impact funding requirements for the Company\u2019s retirement plans. The most significant of these assumptions include return on assets, long-term interest rates and mortality. If the actual results for the plans vary significantly from the actuarial assumptions used, or if laws regulating such retirement plans are changed, Murphy could be required to make more significant funding payments to one or more of its retirement plans in the future and/or it could be required to record a larger liability for future obligations in its Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nMurphy has limited control over supply chain costs.\nThe Company often experiences pressure on its operating and capital expenditures in periods of strong crude oil and natural gas prices because an increase in exploration and production activities due to high oil and natural gas sales prices generally leads to higher demand for, and consequently higher costs for, goods and services in the oil and natural gas industry. In 2021 and at the start of 2022, this scenario of higher costs for goods and services in the oil and gas natural gas industry is being observed. In early 2022, the pressure of rising prices and demand for services has begun affecting the cost of goods and services in the oil and natural gas industry. Murphy has a dedicated procurement department focused on managing supply chain and input costs. Murphy also has certain transportation, processing and production handling services costs fixed through long-term contracts and commitments and therefore is partly protected from increasing price of services. However, from time to time, Murphy will seek to enter new commitments, exercise options to extend contracts and retender contracts for rigs and other industry services which could expose Murphy to the impact of higher prices.\nPART I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nThe Company is exposed to credit risks associated with (i) sales of certain of its products to customers, (ii) joint venture partners and (iii) other counterparties.\nMurphy is exposed to credit risk in three principle areas:\n\u2022 Accounts receivable credit risk from selling its produced commodity to customers;\n\u2022 Joint venture partners related to certain oil and natural gas properties operated by the Company. These joint venture partners may not be able to meet their financial obligation to pay for their share of capital and operating costs as they become due; and\n\u2022 Counterparty credit risk related to forward price commodity hedge contracts to protect the Company\u2019s cash flows against lower oil and natural gas prices\nTo mitigate these risks the Company:\n\u2022 Actively monitors the credit worthiness of all its customers, joint venture partners, and forward commodity hedge counterparties;\n\u2022 Given the inherent credit risks in a cyclical commodity price business, the Company has increased the focus on its review of joint venture partners, the magnitude of potential exposure, and planning suitable actions should a joint venture partner fail to pay its share of capital and operating expenditures.\nThe inability of a purchaser of the Company\u2019s produced commodity, a joint venture partner of the Company, or counterparty in a forward price commodity hedge to meet their respective payment obligations to the Company could have an adverse effect on Murphy\u2019s future earnings and cash flows.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe face various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, which may have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic has evolved from its emergence in early 2020, so has its global impact. Our business has been affected in various ways, including in our results of operations. In 2020 the spread of COVID-19 led to disruption in the global economy and weakness in demand in crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, which applied downward pressure on global commodity prices. In 2021, a combination of the global availability of vaccines and a relaxation of certain government-imposed lockdowns in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic led to an improving global economic outlook and subsequently increased demand for oil and gas. Several COVID-19 variants, such as Delta and Omicron, temporarily created uncertainty in the outlook; however, vaccines remained effective and therefore demand for oil and gas has remained resilient in the second half of 2021 and early 2022.\nThe unpredictable nature of pandemics can therefore create volatility in commodity prices, hence see Risk Factors, \u201cPrice Risk Factors - Volatility in the global prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas can significantly affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\u201d\nIf significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closures or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 or other pandemic, our operations will likely be impacted and decrease our ability to produce, oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas. We may be unable to perform fully on our commitments and our costs may increase as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. These cost increases may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance.\nThe COVID-19 or other pandemic could also cause disruption in our supply chain; cause delay, or limit the ability of vendors and customers to perform, including in making timely payments to us; and cause other unpredictable events.\nWe continue to work with our stakeholders (including customers, employees, suppliers, financial and lending institutions and local communities) to address this global pandemic responsibly. We continue to monitor the situation, to assess further possible implications to our business, supply chain and customers, and to take actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences. The Company continues to exercise financial discipline in managing costs and capital expenditures.\nWe cannot predict the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 or other pandemic. The extent to which the COVID-19 or other health pandemics or epidemics may impact our results will depend on future developments, including, among other factors, the duration and spread of the virus and its variants, availability, acceptance and\nPART I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\neffectiveness of vaccines along with related travel advisories, quarantines and restrictions, the recovery time of the disrupted supply chains and industries, the impact of labor market interruptions, and the impact of government interventions.\nMurphy\u2019s Information Technology environment may be exposed to cyber threats.\nThe oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct exploration, development, and production activities. We are no exception to this trend. As a company, we depend on these technologies to estimate quantities of oil and natural gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, communicate internally and externally, and conduct many other business activities.\nMaintaining the security of our technology and preventing breaches is critical to our business operation. We rely on our information systems to protect and secure intellectual property, strategic plans, customer information, and personally identifiable information, such as employee information.\nA successful or undetected cyberattack has the potential to halt business operations, impair our reputation, weaken our competitive advantage, and / or adversely impact our financial condition. Given the increasing global threats from cybercrime, the Company\u2019s approach to mitigate cybersecurity risk focuses on three key elements:\n\u2022 People - Security awareness education and readiness-testing throughout the year for employees and contractors;\n\u2022 Process - Incorporating \u201ccyber awareness\u201d in our day to day processes and maturing key controls such as recurring internal and external cyber risk assessments, physical and digital asset protection, and security vulnerability remediation via preventative and detective measures; and\n\u2022 Technology - Investing in industry aligned security technology and threat intelligence capabilities.\nAs the sophistication of cyber threats continues to evolve, we may be required to dedicate additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our security measures, or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks.\nMurphy\u2019s operations and earnings have been and will continue to be affected by domestic and worldwide political developments.\nFrom time to time, some governments intervene in the market for crude oil and natural gas produced in their countries through such actions as setting prices, determining rates of production, and controlling who may buy and sell the production.\nMurphy is exposed to regulation, legislation and policies enacted by the federal government. As an example, following the election and inauguration of current president in January 2021, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior issued Order No. 3395 on January 20, 2021. This order served to potentially impact the timing of issuance of oil and gas leases, lease amendments and extension, and drilling permits on federal lands and offshore waters. However, following this notice, the Department of Interior has continued to approve permits and Murphy has not experienced a delay in project approvals. An extension or permanency of this regime could impact the options available to Murphy for future development, reserves available for production and hence future cash flows and profitability. In the event leasing delays or cancellations alter Murphy\u2019s plans in the Gulf of Mexico, the Company believes it will be able to re-focus activities and allocate capital to other areas. The Company does not hold any onshore federal lands in the U.S.\nIn addition, the current presidential administration has pursued other initiatives related to environmental, health and safety standards applicable to the oil and gas industry. These include an executive order in January 2021 that directed the Secretary of the Interior to halt indefinitely new oil and natural gas leases on federal lands and offshore waters pending a since-completed review by the Secretary of the Interior of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices; however, a June 2021 preliminary injunction in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana barred the current presidential administration from implementing the pause in new federal oil and gas leases. This executive order also set forth other initiatives and goals, including procurement of carbon pollution-free electricity, elimination of fossil fuel subsidies, a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035 and a net-zero emissions U.S. economy by 2050. Another executive order from January 2021 called for a\nPART I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nclimate change-focused review of regulations and other executive actions promulgated, issued or adopted during the prior Presidential administration.\nThese actions and any future changes to applicable environmental, health and safety, regulatory and legal requirements promulgated by the current presidential administration and Congress may restrict our access to additional acreage and new leases in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico or lead to limitations or delays on our ability to secure additional permits to drill and develop our acreage and leases or otherwise lead to limitations on the scope of our operations, or may lead to increases to our compliance costs. The potential impacts of these changes on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows cannot be predicted.\nPrices and availability of crude oil, natural gas and refined products could be influenced by political factors and by various governmental policies to restrict or increase petroleum usage and supply. Other governmental actions that could affect Murphy\u2019s operations and earnings include expropriation, tax changes, royalty increases, redefinition of international boundaries, preferential and discriminatory awarding of oil and natural gas leases, restrictions on drilling and/or production, restraints and controls on imports and exports, safety, and relationships between employers and employees. Governments could also initiate regulations concerning matters such as currency fluctuations, currency conversion, protection and remediation of the environment, and concerns over the possibility of global warming caused by the production and use of hydrocarbon energy. As of December 31, 2021, 0.1% of the Company\u2019s proved reserves, as defined by the SEC, were located in countries other than the U.S. and Canada.\nA number of non-governmental entities routinely attempt to influence industry members and government energy policy in an effort to limit industry activities, such as hydrocarbon production, drilling and hydraulic fracturing with the desire to minimize the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, which may harm air quality, and to restrict hydrocarbon spills, which may harm land and/or groundwater.\nAdditionally, because of the numerous countries in which the Company operates, certain other risks exist, including the application of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar anti-corruption compliance statutes in the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nIt is not possible to predict the actions of governments and hence the impact on Murphy\u2019s future operations and earnings.\nMurphy\u2019s insurance may not be adequate to offset costs associated with certain events, and there can be no assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available in the future on terms that justify its purchase.\nMurphy maintains insurance against certain, but not all, hazards that could arise from its operations. The Company maintains liability insurance sufficient to cover its share of gross insured claim costs up to approximately $500 million per occurrence and in the annual aggregate. Generally, this insurance covers various types of third-party claims related to personal injury, death and property damage, including claims arising from \u201csudden and accidental\u201d pollution events. The Company also maintains insurance coverage for property damage and well control with an additional limit of $450 million per occurrence ($875 million for Gulf of Mexico claims), all or part of which could apply to certain sudden and accidental pollution events. These policies have deductibles ranging from $10 million to $25 million. The occurrence of an event that is not insured or not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nMurphy could face long-term challenges to the fossil fuels business model reducing demand and price for hydrocarbon fuels.\nAs environmental and social trends change towards less carbon intensive energy sources, Murphy\u2019s business model may come under more pressure from changing global demands for non-fossil fuel energy sources. As part of Murphy\u2019s strategy review process, the Company reviews hydrocarbon demand forecasts and assesses the impact on its business model and plans. The Company also has significant natural gas reserves which emit lower carbon compared to oil and liquids.\nThe issue of climate change has caused considerable attention to be directed towards initiatives to reduce global GHG emissions. The Paris Agreement and COP26 have resulted in commitments from many countries to reduce GHG emissions and have called for parties to eliminate certain fossil fuel subsidies and pursue further action on non-carbon dioxide GHGs. In addition, the federal government could issue various executive orders that may result in additional laws, rules and regulations in the area of climate change. It is possible that the Paris\nPART I\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nAgreement, COP26, government executive orders and other such initiatives, including foreign, federal and state laws, rules or regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, may reduce the demand for crude oil and natural gas globally. In addition to regulatory risk, other market and social initiatives such as public and private initiatives that aim to subsidize the development of non-fossil fuel energy sources, may reduce the competitiveness of carbon-based fuels, such as oil and gas. While the magnitude of any reduction in hydrocarbon demand is difficult to predict, such a development could adversely impact the Company and other companies engaged in the exploration and production business. With or without renewable-energy subsidies, the unknown pace and strength of technological advancement of non-fossil-fuel energy sources creates uncertainty about the timing and pace of effects on our business model. The Company continually monitors the global climate change agenda initiatives and plans accordingly based on its assessment of such initiatives on its business.\nLawsuits against Murphy and its subsidiaries could adversely affect its operating results.\nThe Company or certain of its consolidated subsidiaries are involved in numerous legal proceedings, including lawsuits for alleged personal injuries, property damages and other business-related matters. Certain of these claims may take many years to resolve through court and arbitration proceedings or negotiated settlements. In the opinion of management and based upon currently known facts and circumstances, the currently pending legal proceedings are not expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect upon the Company\u2019s operations or financial condition.\nPART I", "PERMNO": 28345, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "MUR"}
