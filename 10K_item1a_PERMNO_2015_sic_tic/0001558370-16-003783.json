Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face but are risks we believe material at this time. Additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, may also impair our business operations or financial results. If any of the events or circumstances described below occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations and the trading price of our securities could decline. Investors and prospective investors should consider the following risks and the information contained under the heading \u201cWarning Concerning Forward Looking Statements\u201d before deciding whether to invest in our securities.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nA small percentage decline in our revenues or increase in our expenses could have a material adverse impact upon our operating results.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our revenues were $1.37 billion and our operating expenses, excluding noncash charges for long lived asset impairments, were $1.38 billion. A small percentage decline in our revenues or increase in our expenses could have a material adverse impact on our operating results because some of our fixed costs, such as our base rent, would not decrease during times of lower revenues and could not be reduced to offset other expenses which may be increasing.\nThe failure of Medicare and Medicaid rates to match our costs will reduce our income or create losses.\nSome of our current operations, especially our SNFs, receive significant revenues from Medicare and Medicaid. During each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we derived approximately 22% and 23%, respectively, of our senior living revenues from continuing operations from these programs. Payments under Medicare and Medicaid are set by government policy, laws and regulations. The rate and amount of these payments are subject to periodic adjustment. Current and projected federal budget deficits, federal spending priorities and challenging state fiscal conditions have resulted in numerous recent legislative and regulatory actions or proposed actions with respect to Medicare and Medicaid payments, insurance and healthcare delivery. Examples of these, and other information regarding such matters and developments, are provided under the caption \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation and Reimbursement\u201d above. We cannot estimate the type and magnitude of these matters. However, these matters could result in the failure of Medicare or Medicaid payment rates to cover our costs of providing required services to residents, in reductions in payments to us or other circumstances that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCircumstances that adversely affect the ability of seniors or their families to pay for our services could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur residents paid approximately 78% of our senior living revenues from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2015 from their private resources. We expect to continue to rely on the ability of our residents to pay for our services from their own financial resources. Inflation, high levels of unemployment, housing market declines, market declines affecting the value and liquidity of other personal assets, or other circumstances affecting the ability of seniors or their families to pay for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSeniors\u2019 inability to sell their homes may delay their moving into senior living communities.\nHousing price declines and reduced home mortgage financing availability have negatively affected the U.S. housing market. Although home prices and sales activity have increased during the past few years, they continue to be generally below levels experienced prior to the recent economic recession in the United States. Further, although mortgage financing availability has improved since the recession, in December 2015 the U.S. Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, and market interest rates may further increase in the future; if interest rates rise sharply, home prices or sales activity may decline. Difficulties in the U.S. housing market may have a negative effect on our revenues or result in increased reliance on Medicare and Medicaid for our revenues. Specifically, if seniors have a difficult time selling their homes, fewer seniors may relocate to our senior living communities or finance their stays at our senior living communities with their private resources.\nPrivate third party payers continue to try to reduce healthcare costs.\nPrivate third party payers such as insurance companies continue their efforts to control healthcare costs through direct contracts with healthcare providers, increased utilization review practices and greater enrollment in managed care programs and preferred provider organizations. These third party payers increasingly demand discounted fee structures and the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk. These efforts of third party payers to limit the amount of payments we receive for healthcare services could adversely affect us. Reimbursement payments under third party payer programs may not remain at levels comparable to present levels or be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients participating in such programs. Future changes in, or renegotiations of, the reimbursement rates or methods of third party payers, or the implementation of other measures to reduce payments for our services could result in a substantial reduction in our net operating revenues. At the same time, as a result of competitive pressures, our ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to private pay residents may be limited.\nProvisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act could reduce our income and increase our costs.\nThe ACA contains insurance changes, payment changes and healthcare delivery systems changes that have affected, and will continue to affect, us. The ACA provides for multiple reductions to the annual market basket updates for inflation that may result in reductions in SNF Medicare payment rates. In addition, certain provisions of the ACA that affect employers generally, including the employer shared responsibility provisions that went into effect on January 1, 2015, may have an impact on the design and cost of the health coverage that we offer to our employees. We are unable to predict the impact of the ACA on our future financial results of operations, but it may be adverse and material. In addition, maintaining compliance with the ACA will require us to expend management time and financial resources.\nThe ACA also established an Independent Payment Advisory Board to submit legislative proposals to Congress and take other actions with a goal of reducing Medicare spending growth. When and if such spending reductions take effect, they may be adverse and material to our financial results. The ACA includes other changes that may affect us, such as enforcement reforms and Medicare and Medicaid program integrity control initiatives, new compliance, ethics and public disclosure requirements, initiatives to encourage the development of home and community based long term care services rather than institutional services under Medicaid, value based purchasing plans and a Medicare post acute care pilot program to develop and evaluate making a bundled payment for services, including physician and SNF services, provided during an episode of care. We are unable to predict the impact on us of the insurance, payment, and healthcare delivery systems reforms contained in and to be developed pursuant to the ACA. If the changes implemented under the ACA result in reduced payments for our services or the failure of Medicare, Medicaid or insurance payment rates to cover our increasing costs, our future financial results could be adversely and materially affected.\nIncreases in our labor costs may have a material adverse effect on us.\nWages and employee benefits associated with our continuing operations were approximately 41% of our 2015 total operating expenses. We compete with other senior living community operators, among others, to attract and retain qualified personnel responsible for the day to day operations of our communities. The market for qualified nurses, therapists and other healthcare professionals is highly competitive and periodic or geographic area shortages of such healthcare professionals may require us to increase the wages and benefits we offer to our employees in order to attract and retain such personnel or to utilize temporary personnel at an increased cost. In addition, employee benefit costs, including health insurance and workers\u2019 compensation insurance costs, have materially increased in recent years and, as\ndiscussed above, we cannot predict the future impact of the ACA on the cost of employee health insurance. Although we determine our employee health insurance and workers\u2019 compensation self insurance reserves with guidance from third party professionals, our reserves may nonetheless be inadequate. Increasing employee health insurance and workers\u2019 compensation insurance costs and increasing self insurance reserves for labor related insurance may materially and adversely affect our earnings.\nWe cannot assure that our labor costs will not increase or that any increases will be recovered by corresponding increases in the rates we charge to residents or otherwise. Any significant failure by us to control labor costs or to pass any increases on to residents through rate increases could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, increased costs charged to our residents may reduce our occupancy and growth.\nIf we do not achieve and maintain high quality of care, payments through pay-for-performance and value-based purchasing programs may be reduced, and the overall attractiveness of our communities to potential residents could decrease as more quality data becomes publicly available.\nAs noted above, CMS is moving towards pay-for-performance programs, such as value-based payment. Under PAMA, beginning in federal fiscal year 2019, Medicare payment rates will be partially based on SNFs\u2019 performance scores on a hospital readmissions measure as part of CMS\u2019s new value-based purchasing program. Moreover, under the IMPACT Act, HHS will require SNFs to begin reporting certain quality measures and resource use measures in a standardized and interoperable format by October 1, 2016 and begin reporting certain patient assessment data in such a format by October 1, 2018. Beginning in federal fiscal year 2018, SNFs that fail to comply with the reporting requirements by the established times will be subject to a 2.0% reduction in their Medicare payment rates for that fiscal year. Beginning October 1, 2018, HHS will make this data publicly available. We cannot predict the impact of these quality-driven payment reforms, but they may be material to and adversely affect our future results of operations. In addition, we cannot predict the impact of more quality data becoming publically available, but if we do not achieve and maintain high quality of care, the overall attractiveness of our communities to potential residents could decrease.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation which increases our costs and may result in losses.\nLicensing and Medicare and Medicaid laws require operators of senior living communities and rehabilitation and wellness clinics to comply with extensive standards governing operations and physical environments. Federal and state laws also prohibit fraud and abuse by senior living providers and rehabilitation and wellness clinic operators, including civil and criminal laws that prohibit false claims and regulate patient referrals in Medicare, Medicaid and other programs. In recent years, federal and state governments have devoted increased resources to monitoring the quality of care at senior living communities and to anti-fraud investigations in healthcare generally. CMS contractors are expanding the retroactive audits of Medicare claims submitted by SNFs and other providers, and recouping alleged overpayments for services determined by auditors not to have been medically necessary or not to meet Medicare coverage criteria as billed. State Medicaid programs and other third party payers are conducting similar medical necessity and compliance audits. When federal or state agencies identify violations of anti-fraud, false claims, anti-kickback and physician referral laws, they may impose or seek civil or criminal penalties, treble damages and other governmental sanctions, and may revoke the community\u2019s license or make conditional or exclude the community from Medicare or Medicaid participation. The ACA amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, making it easier for government agencies and private plaintiffs to prevail in lawsuits brought against healthcare providers, and for severe fines and penalties to be imposed on healthcare providers that violate applicable laws and regulations. In addition, when these agencies determine that there have been quality of care deficiencies or improper billing, they may impose or seek various remedies or sanctions, including denial of new admissions, exclusion from Medicare or Medicaid program participation, monetary penalties, restitution of overpayments, governmental oversight, temporary management, loss of licensure and criminal penalties. Current state laws and regulations allow enforcement officials to make determinations as to whether the care provided at our communities exceeds the level of care for which a particular community is licensed. A finding that a community is delivering care beyond the scope of its license could result in the immediate discharge and transfer of residents. Certain states and the federal government may determine that citations relating to one community affect other communities operated by the same entity or related entities, which may negatively impact an operator\u2019s ability to maintain or renew other licenses or Medicare or Medicaid certifications or to secure new licenses or certifications. In\naddition, revocation of a license or certification at one community could impact our ability to obtain new licenses or certifications or to maintain or renew existing licenses and certifications at other communities, and trigger defaults under our leases, our management agreements with SNH and the agreement governing our credit facility, or adversely affect our ability to operate or obtain financing in the future.\nOur communities incur sanctions and penalties from time to time. As a result of the healthcare industry\u2019s extensive regulatory system and increasing enforcement initiatives, we have experienced increased costs for monitoring quality of care compliance, billing procedures, and compliance with referral laws and other laws that apply to us, and we expect these costs may continue to increase. For example, as previously disclosed and disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as a result of our compliance program to review medical records related to our Medicare billing practices, during 2014 we discovered potentially inadequate documentation and other issues at one of our leased SNFs. This compliance review was not initiated in response to any specific complaint or allegation, but was a review of the type that we periodically undertake to test our own compliance with applicable Medicare billing rules. As a result of these discoveries, in February 2015, we made a voluntary disclosure of deficiencies to the OIG pursuant to the OIG\u2019s Provider Self-Disclosure Protocol. We completed our investigation and assessment of these matters and submitted a final supplemental disclosure to the OIG in May 2015. At December 31, 2014, we had accrued a revenue reserve of $4.3 million for historical Medicare payments we received that we expect to repay as a result of these deficiencies. For the year ended December 31, 2015, this revenue reserve was increased by $2.4 million and totals $6.7 million as of December 31, 2015. In addition, we have recorded expense for additional costs we incurred or expect to incur, including OIG imposed penalties, as a result of this matter totaling $4.8 million and $3.6 million for the years ending December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, of which $4.0 million remains accrued and not paid at December 31, 2015.\nIf we become subject to additional regulatory sanctions or repayment obligations at any of our existing communities (or at any of our newly acquired communities with prior deficiencies that we are unable to correct or resolve), our business may be adversely affected, and we might experience financial losses. Any adverse determination concerning any of our licenses or eligibility for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement or any penalties, repayments, or sanctions, and the increasing costs of required compliance with applicable federal and state laws, may adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nSuccessful union organization of our employees may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time labor unions attempt to organize our employees. If federal legislation modifies the labor laws to make it easier for employee groups to unionize, additional groups of employees may seek union representation. If our employees were to unionize, it could result in business interruptions, work stoppages, the degradation of service levels due to work rules, or increased operating expenses that may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to litigation.\nWe have been, are currently, and expect in the future to be involved in claims, lawsuits and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, some of which may involve material amounts. For example, as discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we were defendants in a lawsuit filed by the estate of a former resident of a senior living community operated by us in which a verdict was rendered against us awarding damages of approximately $19.2 million, which consisted of $2.5 million for pain and suffering and the remainder in punitive damages. In February 2016, we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiff for approximately $7.3 million, including approximately $3.0 million which our liability insurer has agreed to reimburse us. We believe our liability insurer may be financially responsible for more than $3.0 million and we are seeking additional payments from our liability insurer; however, we cannot predict the outcome of any future negotiations or litigation with our liability insurer. The defense and resolution of this and other such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings may require us to incur significant expense.\nIn several well publicized instances, private litigation by residents of senior living communities for alleged abuses has resulted in large damage awards against other senior living companies. Some lawyers and law firms specialize in bringing litigation against senior living community operators. As a result of this litigation and potential\nlitigation, the cost of our liability insurance continues to increase. Medical liability insurance reform has become a topic of political debate and some states have enacted legislation to limit future liability awards. However, such reforms have not generally been adopted and we expect our insurance costs may continue to increase. Although we determine our self insurance reserves with guidance from third party professionals, our reserves may nonetheless be inadequate. Increasing liability insurance costs and increasing self insurance reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur growth strategy may not succeed.\nWe intend to continue to grow our business through acquisitions and by entering into additional long term lease and management arrangements for senior living communities where residents\u2019 private resources account for all or a large majority of revenues. Our business plan includes seeking to take advantage of expected increases in demand for senior living communities. Our growth strategy involves risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\nwe may be unable to identify and acquire additional senior living communities at acceptable purchase prices or to identify and lease or manage additional senior living communities on acceptable terms;\n\u00b7\nwe may be unable to access the capital required to fund acquisitions or to operate additional senior living communities;\n\u00b7\nwe may be unable to identify and operate or manage additional senior living communities where residents\u2019 private resources account for all or a large majority of revenues;\n\u00b7\nwe may not achieve the operating results we expect from newly acquired, leased or managed senior living communities;\n\u00b7\nthe operations of newly acquired, leased or managed senior living communities may subject us to unanticipated contingent liabilities or regulatory matters;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to make significant capital expenditures to improve newly acquired, leased or managed senior living communities, including capital expenditures that were unanticipated at the time of acquisition or entry into the lease or management arrangements;\n\u00b7\nwe may have difficulty retaining key employees and other personnel at newly acquired, leased or managed senior living communities;\n\u00b7\nto the extent we incur debt in connection with acquisitions or incur additional lease obligations associated with new leased senior living communities, our operating leverage and resulting risks of debt defaults may increase;\n\u00b7\nto the extent we issue equity to fund acquisitions, our stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership of us will be diluted;\n\u00b7\nwe may experience declines in occupancy at newly acquired, leased or managed senior living communities and it may take a period of time to stabilize the operations of newly acquired, leased or managed senior living communities;\n\u00b7\nintegrating the operations of newly acquired, leased or managed senior living communities may disrupt our existing operations, or may cost more than anticipated;\n\u00b7\nwe may assume or become responsible for known or unknown liabilities with regard to a newly acquired, leased or managed senior living community for the period prior to when we acquired or began to lease or manage the community and those assumptions of liabilities may be without any\nrecourse or with only limited recourse; these liabilities may include, among others, cleanup of undisclosed environmental contamination, claims by vendors or other persons dealing with the former owners and claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the senior living communities; and\n\u00b7\nany failure to comply with licensing requirements at our senior living communities may prevent our obtaining licenses for, or renewing licenses at, senior living communities we want to acquire, lease or manage.\nFor these reasons and others:\n\u00b7\nour growth strategy may not succeed;\n\u00b7\nthe benefits which we hope to achieve by growth may not be realized;\n\u00b7\nwe may suffer declines in profitability or suffer recurring losses; and\n\u00b7\nour existing operations may suffer from a lack of management attention or financial resources if such attention and resources are devoted to a failed growth strategy.\nWe have not been consistently profitable, and we have limited resources and substantial lease obligations.\nWe have not been consistently profitable since we became a public company in 2001, and we currently have limited resources and substantial lease obligations. Although we have access to our $150.0 million revolving credit facility, and we have notified the lenders under that facility of our intent to exercise our second one year option to extend the maturity date of that facility to April 2017, subject to the payment of an extension fee and meeting certain other conditions, in the longer term we may be unable to maintain that facility, or obtain a replacement facility on similar or more favorable terms. Given our history of losses, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and/or maintain profitability in the future. If are unable to effectively manage our operations and cash flow, or achieve profitability in other ways, the market price of our common shares may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to obtain financing or extend or refinance debt as it matures to grow or operate our business due to disruptions in the financial markets or otherwise.\nThe U.S. economy\u2019s recovery from its most recent recession has been slow, unsteady and incomplete, which has created volatile market conditions. While the markets had been showing signs of stabilization and growth, new challenges have arisen, including uncertain U.S. Federal Reserve policy regarding the timing and amount of future increases in interest rates and the risk that declining overseas markets may hinder the growth of the U.S. economy. It remains unclear whether the U.S. economy will be able to withstand these market challenges and global uncertainty and achieve meaningful and sustained growth. These circumstances materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets, making terms for certain financings less attractive, and in some cases resulted in the unavailability of financing. Economic weakness in the U.S. economy generally, a new recession, our inability to achieve consistent profitability or a perceived decline in our communities would likely adversely affect our ability to access additional financing (including any refinancing or extension of our existing debt) on reasonable terms, which may negatively affect our business.\nWe may be unable to use our federal net operating loss or tax credit carry forwards before they expire, or our ability to use our federal net operating loss or tax credit carry forwards may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our federal net operating loss carry forwards, which are scheduled to begin expiring in 2026 if unused, were approximately $125.5 million, and our tax credit carry forwards, which begin expiring in 2022 if unused, were approximately $19.4 million. As of December 31, 2014, we determined it was more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets would not be realized and concluded that a full valuation allowance was required. If in the future we use our federal net operating loss or tax credit carry forwards to reduce our tax liabilities, the existence and amounts\nof these federal net operating loss or tax credit carry forwards may be subject to audit by the relevant tax authorities and the amounts of these federal net operating loss or tax credit carry forwards may be reduced.\nOur credit agreement contains terms limiting our ability to incur additional debt. These terms, or our failure or inability to meet them, could adversely affect our business.\nThe agreement governing our $150.0 million revolving credit facility, or our credit agreement, includes various conditions to our borrowing and various financial and other covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain certain minimum debt service coverage and leverage ratios, and events of default. We may not be able to satisfy all of these conditions or may default on some of these covenants for various reasons, including matters which are beyond our control. Further, maintaining compliance with these covenants may limit our ability to pursue actions that may otherwise be beneficial to us and our stockholders.\nIf we are unable to borrow under our credit facility, we may be unable to meet our business obligations or to grow by buying additional senior living communities, or we may be required to sell some of our senior living communities. If we default under our credit agreement, our lenders may demand immediate payment and may elect not to make further borrowings available to us. Any default under our credit agreement that resulted in our obligations to repay outstanding indebtedness being accelerated or in our no longer being permitted to borrow under our credit facility would likely have serious and adverse consequences to us and would likely cause the market price of our common shares to materially decline.\nIn the future, we may obtain additional debt financing, and the covenants and conditions which apply to any such additional indebtedness may be more restrictive than the covenants and conditions contained in our credit facility. Defaults under our future debt could likely have the same consequences as described above.\nOur business could be adversely impacted if there are deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting.\nThe design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. In 2014, we determined that we had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting relating to our lack of sufficient personnel with requisite accounting competencies and insufficient level of oversight in the financial statement close process. These material weaknesses were remediated as of December 31, 2015; however, while management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Deficiencies, including any material weaknesses, in our internal control over financial reporting could result in misstatements of our results of operations or our financial statements or could otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nFailure to comply with laws governing the privacy and security of personal information, including relating to health, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are required to comply with federal and state laws governing the privacy, security, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information, including information relating to health. Under HIPAA and the HITECH Act, as updated by the HIPAA Omnibus Rule, we are required to comply with the HIPAA privacy rule, security standards, and standards for electronic healthcare transactions. State laws also govern the privacy of individual health information, and rules regarding state privacy rights may be more stringent than HIPAA. Other federal and state laws govern the privacy of other personal information. If we fail to comply with applicable federal or state standards, we could be subject to civil sanctions and criminal penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including medical records, financial transactions and maintenance of records, which may include personally identifiable information of residents or other customers, employees and vendors.\nWe rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing confidential resident or other customer, employee and vendor information, such as personally identifiable information relating to health and financial accounts. Although we take various actions to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems, it is possible that our security measures will not prevent the systems\u2019 improper functioning, or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber attacks. Security breaches, including physical or electronic break ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect us.\nTermination of assisted living resident agreements and resident attrition could adversely affect our revenues and earnings.\nState regulations governing assisted living communities typically require a written resident agreement with each resident. Most of these regulations also require that each resident have the right to terminate these assisted living resident agreements for any reason on reasonable notice. Consistent with these regulations, most of our resident agreements allow residents to terminate their agreements on 30 days\u2019 notice. Thus, we may be unable to contract with assisted living residents to stay for longer periods of time, unlike typical apartment leasing arrangements that involve lease agreements with terms of up to a year or longer. If a large number of residents elected to terminate their resident agreements at or around the same time, our revenues and earnings could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the advanced ages of our senior living residents make the resident turnover rate in our senior living communities difficult to predict.\nThe trend for senior citizens to delay moving to senior living communities until they reach an older age or require greater care may increase operating costs, reduce occupancy and increase resident turnover rate at our senior living communities.\nSenior citizens have been increasingly delaying their moves to senior living communities, including to our senior living communities, until they reach an older age. If this trend continues, the occupancy rate at our senior living communities may decline and the resident turnover rate at our communities may increase. Further, older aged persons may have greater care needs and require higher acuity services, which may increase our cost of business, expose us to additional liability or result in lost business and shorter stays at our senior living communities if we are not able to provide the requisite care services or fail to adequately provide those services.\nOur business requires us to make significant capital expenditures to maintain and improve our senior living communities.\nOur senior living communities sometimes require significant expenditures to address required ongoing maintenance or to make them more attractive to residents. Physical characteristics of senior living communities are mandated by various governmental authorities; changes in these regulations may require us to make significant expenditures. In addition, we are often required to make significant capital expenditures when we acquire, lease or manage new senior living communities. Our available financial resources may be insufficient to fund these expenditures. SNH has historically provided most of the capital required to improve the senior living communities we lease from them or manage for their account. However, when SNH funds capital expenditures at our leased senior living communities our rent increases, and when SNH funds capital expenditures at our managed senior living communities the invested capital on which SNH\u2019s returns are based increases. We may be unable to pay increased rent at our leased senior living communities without experiencing losses and increases in SNH\u2019s invested capital at our managed communities may reduce or prevent our receipt of incentive fees or subject the agreements to termination by SNH if it is unable to realize its return on invested capital under the applicable agreements.\nWe face significant competition.\nWe compete with numerous other senior living community operators, as well as companies that provide senior living services, such as home healthcare companies and other real estate based service providers. In recent years, a significant number of new assisted living communities have been developed, and this increased development activity may continue in the future. Although some states require certificates of need to develop new SNFs and assisted living communities, there are fewer barriers to competition for home healthcare, for independent and assisted living communities or for other real estate based services. Some of our existing competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than us. Some of our competitors are not for profit entities which have endowment income and may not face the same financial pressures that we do. We cannot assure that we will be able to attract a sufficient number of residents to our communities or that we will be able to attract employees and control wages and other employee benefits, including health insurance and workers\u2019 compensation insurance costs, or other operating expenses, such that we will be able to compete successfully and operate profitably.\nIncreased leverage may harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur total consolidated long term debt as of December 31, 2015 was approximately $60.4 million and represented approximately 20% of our total book capitalization as of that date. We also had $50.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and approximately $1.8 million of short term mortgage debt. In addition to our indebtedness, we have substantial lease and other obligations.\nOur level of indebtedness and substantial lease and other obligations could impact our business in the following ways, among others:\n\u00b7\nour ability to satisfy our debt obligations could be affected;\n\u00b7\nthe funds required to make interest and principal payments will not be available for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain additional financing may be impaired;\n\u00b7\nour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry may be limited; and\n\u00b7\nwe may be more vulnerable to downturns in our business and industry or the economy generally.\nIncreasing interest rates may adversely affect us.\nSince the most recent recession, the U.S. Federal Reserve has taken actions which have resulted in low interest rates prevailing in the marketplace for a historically long period of time. In December 2015, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point. Market interest rates may continue to increase and the increase may materially and negatively affect us. Increases in interest rates could adversely impact the housing market and reduce demand for our services and occupancy at our communities, could increase our rent expense at our leased senior living communities due to the landlord setting rent based on a required return on the its investment, and could reduce the likelihood that we will earn incentive fees at our managed senior living communities due to the owners requiring a minimum return on their investment prior to our being eligible to receive an incentive fee.\nInterest rates may negatively impact the value of our common shares, which may increase our cost of capital, including decreasing the amount of equity and debt we may be able to raise, increasing the extent of dilution from any equity offering we may make or increasing the costs to us for any such equity or debt offering.\nAmounts outstanding under our credit facility require interest to be paid at variable interest rates. When interest rates increase, so will our interest costs, which could adversely affect our cash flow, our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt, our cost of refinancing our debt when it becomes due and our ability to fund our operations and\nworking capital. Additionally, if we choose to hedge our interest rate risk, we cannot assure that the hedge will be effective or that our hedging counterparty will meet its obligations to us.\nAn increase in interest rates could decrease the amount buyers may be willing to pay for our senior living communities, thereby reducing the market value of our senior living communities and limiting our ability to sell senior living communities or to obtain mortgage financing secured by our senior living communities. Further, increased interest rates may effectively increase the cost of senior living communities we acquire to the extent we utilize leverage for those acquisitions and may result in a reduction in our acquisitions to the extent we reduce the amount we offer to pay for senior living communities, due to the effect of increased interest rates, to a price that sellers may not accept.\nIn addition, increased interest rates may increase our operating costs to the extent we utilize financing, such as borrowings under our credit facility, to fund our operations.\nOur operations are subject to environmental and climate change risks.\nOur operations are subject to risks associated with environmental hazards. We may be liable for environmental hazards at, or migrating from, the properties on which our owned, leased and managed senior living communities are located, including those created by prior owners or occupants, abutters or other persons. Various federal and state laws impose liabilities upon property owners, such as us, for any environmental damages arising at, or migrating from, properties they own, and we cannot assure that we will not be held liable for environmental investigation and clean up at, or near, our properties. As an owner or previous owner of properties which contain environmental hazards, we also may be liable to pay damages to governmental agencies or third parties for costs and damages they incur arising from environmental hazards at, or migrating from, our properties. In addition, under our leases with SNH, we have agreed to indemnify SNH for any such liabilities related to the properties on which our senior living communities that we lease from SNH are located. Moreover, costs and damages which may arise from environmental hazards are often difficult to project and may be substantial.\nWe believe any asbestos in our senior living communities is contained in accordance with current regulations, and we have no current plans to remove it. If we removed the asbestos or demolished these senior living communities, certain environmental regulations govern the manner in which the asbestos must be handled and removed, and we could incur substantial costs complying with such regulations.\nThere have recently been severe weather activities in different parts of the country that some observers believe evidence global climate change. Such severe weather that may result from climate change may have an adverse effect on the senior living communities we operate. Further, the current political debate about climate change has resulted in various treaties, laws and regulations which are intended to limit carbon emissions. We believe these laws being enacted or proposed may cause energy costs at our senior living communities to increase. In the long term, we believe any such increased costs will be passed through and paid by our residents and other customers through rate increases. However, in the short term, these increased costs, if material in amount, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For more information regarding climate change matters and their possible adverse impact on us, please see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Impact of Climate Change\u201d in Part II, Item 7 below.\nOur former rehabilitation hospitals may be subject to retroactive Medicare reclassifications or repayments.\nDuring the period we operated our rehabilitation hospitals, which were sold in the fourth quarter of 2013, Medicare payments accounted for a significant amount of the rehabilitation hospitals\u2019 revenues. CMS has established a standard known as the \u201c60% Rule,\u201d which provides that at least 60% of an inpatient rehabilitation facility\u2019s, or IRFs, total inpatient population must require intensive rehabilitation services associated with treatment of at least one of 13 designated medical conditions in order for the facility to be classified as an IRF by the Medicare program. Although we believe that our IRFs were operated in compliance with the 60% Rule during the period in which we operated them, CMS could determine that we were non-compliant in a prior year. Such an event would result in these rehabilitation hospitals being subject to Medicare reclassification to a different type of provider and our receiving lower Medicare payment rates retroactively. Reductions in our Medicare payments as a result of the reclassification of our rehabilitation\nhospitals could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Also, retroactive audits of Medicare claims submitted by IRFs and other providers are expanding, and CMS is recouping amounts paid for services determined by auditors not to have been medically necessary or not to meet Medicare criteria for coverage as billed. If our communities were required to make substantial retroactive repayments to Medicare, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges in lease accounting standards may materially and adversely affect us.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, recently adopted new accounting rules, to be effective for our fiscal year ending after December 2018, that will require companies to capitalize all leases on their balance sheets by recognizing a lessee\u2019s rights and obligations. When the rules are effective, we will be required to account for the leases for our senior living communities, including those with SNH, in the assets and liabilities on our balance sheet, where previously we accounted for such leases on an \u201coff balance sheet\u201d basis. As a result, a significant amount of lease related assets and liabilities will be recorded on our balance sheet and we may be required to make other changes to the recording and classification of our lease related expenses. Though these changes will not have any direct impact on our overall financial condition, these changes could cause investors or others to believe that we are highly leveraged and could change the calculations of financial metrics and covenants, as well as third party financial models regarding our financial condition.\nRISKS ARISING FROM CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS OF OURS AND OUR ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE\nWe are subject to possible conflicts of interest; our agreements and relationship with SNH and RMR LLC may restrict our ability to grow our business; and we have engaged in, and expect to continue to engage in, transactions with parties that may be considered related parties.\nOur business is subject to possible conflicts of interest as follows:\n\u00b7\nas of December 31, 2015, we leased from SNH 177 of our 274 senior living communities for total annual rent of approximately $192.3 million plus percentage rent based on increases in gross revenues at certain properties;\n\u00b7\nas of December 31, 2015, we managed 60 senior living communities which are owned by SNH, and during 2015, we realized $10.7 million in management fees from SNH;\n\u00b7\nwe manage a portion of a senior living community for D&R Yonkers LLC, which is owned by SNH\u2019s president and chief operating officer and our Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer and to which a subsidiary of SNH subleases that portion of the community;\n\u00b7\nRMR LLC, the manager of SNH, provides business management services to us;\n\u00b7\nour President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Bruce J. Mackey Jr., and our Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Richard A. Doyle, are also officers and employees of RMR LLC; one of our Managing Directors, Mr. Barry Portnoy, is a Managing Director, officer and controlling shareholder (through ABP Trust (f/k/a Reit Management & Research Trust)) of The RMR Group Inc., or RMR Inc., an officer of RMR LLC and a managing trustee of SNH;\n\u00b7\nRMR LLC\u2019s simultaneous contractual obligations to us and SNH create potential conflicts of interest, or the appearance of such conflicts of interest, and under the business management agreement with RMR LLC, in the event of a conflict between SNH and us, RMR LLC may act on behalf of SNH rather than on our behalf; and\n\u00b7\nwe lease our headquarters from an affiliate of RMR LLC.\nOn December 31, 2001, SNH distributed substantially all of its ownership of our common shares to its shareholders. Simultaneously with the spin off, we entered into agreements with SNH and RMR LLC which, among other things, limit (subject to certain exceptions) ownership of more than 9.8% of our voting shares, restrict our ability to take any action that could jeopardize the tax status of SNH as a real estate investment trust and limit our ability to acquire real estate of types which are owned by SNH or other businesses managed by RMR LLC. As a result of these agreements, our leases and management agreements with SNH, and our business management agreement with RMR LLC, SNH, RMR LLC and their respective affiliates have significant roles in our business. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, SNH owned 4.2 million of our common shares, or approximately 8.6% of our outstanding common shares, and SNH is our largest stockholder.\nWe believe that our historical and ongoing business dealings with SNH, RMR LLC and D&R Yonkers LLC have benefited us and that, despite these possible conflicts of interest, the transactions we have entered with SNH, RMR LLC and D&R Yonkers LLC have been commercially reasonable and not less favorable than otherwise available to us. Nonetheless, in the past, in particular following periods of volatility in the overall market or declines in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholder litigation, dissident stockholder director nominations and dissident stockholder proposals have often been instituted against companies alleging conflicts of interest in business dealings with affiliated and related persons and entities. Our relationships with SNH, RMR LLC, D&R Yonkers LLC, AIC, the other businesses and entities to which RMR LLC provides management services, Mr. Portnoy and with other related parties of RMR LLC may precipitate such activities. These activities, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention, even if the action is unfounded.\nOur leases of certain of our senior living communities are subordinated to mortgage debt of SNH, and a default by SNH could result in the termination of those leases.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our leases with SNH for 25 of our senior living communities, which had 2015 revenues totaling $175.9 million were subordinated to mortgage financing secured by such communities. As a result, in the event SNH was to default on such mortgage financing, by reason of our default under our leases or for reasons unrelated to us or beyond our control, and its lender were to foreclose on those properties, our leases would terminate as a matter of law. While we may be able to enter into new leases with the lenders or the purchaser or purchasers of such properties, or they may elect to continue our occupancy under the terms of the lease as if there had been no foreclosure, they would not be obligated to pursue either of those options and, if we are able to retain possession, the terms of our continued occupancy may not be as favorable to us as those contained in our leases with SNH. If we do not enter into new leases of such communities following a foreclosure, we would lose the right to continue to operate these communities and we may incur material obligations to residents, employees and other parties as a result of such loss.\nOwnership limitations and certain provisions in our charter, bylaws and certain material agreements, as well as certain provisions of Maryland law, may deter, delay or prevent a change in our control or unsolicited acquisition proposals.\nOur charter and bylaws contain separate provisions which prohibit any stockholder from owning more than 9.8% and 5% of the number or value of any class or series of our outstanding shares of stock. The 9.8% ownership limitation in our charter is consistent with our contractual obligation with SNH to not take actions that may conflict with SNH\u2019s status as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code. The 5% ownership limitation in our bylaws is intended to help us preserve the tax treatment of our NOLs and other tax benefits. We also believe these provisions promote good orderly governance. These provisions inhibit acquisitions of a significant stake in us and may deter, delay or prevent a change in control of us or unsolicited acquisition proposals that a stockholder may consider favorable. Additionally, provisions contained in our charter and bylaws or under Maryland law may have a similar impact, including, for example, provisions relating to:\n\u00b7\nthe division of our Directors into three classes, with the term of one class expiring each year, which could delay a change of control;\n\u00b7\nstockholder voting rights and standards for the election of Directors and other provisions which require larger majorities for approval of actions which are not approved by our Directors than for actions which are approved by our Directors;\n\u00b7\nthe authority of our Board of Directors, and not our stockholders, to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws and to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors;\n\u00b7\nrequired qualifications for an individual to serve as a Director and a requirement that certain of our Directors be \u201cIndependent Directors\u201d and other Directors be \u201cManaging Directors\u201d, as defined in our bylaws;\n\u00b7\nlimitations on the ability of our stockholders to propose nominees for election as Directors and propose other business to be considered at a meeting of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nlimitations on the ability of our stockholders to remove our Directors; and\n\u00b7\nthe authority of our Board of Directors to create and issue new classes or series of stock (including stock with voting rights and other rights and privileges that may deter a change in control) and issue additional common stock.\nIn addition, our shareholders agreement with respect to AIC provides that AIC and the other shareholders of AIC may have rights to acquire our interests in AIC in the event that anyone acquires more than 9.8% of our shares or we experience some other change in control. The terms of our leases and management agreements with SNH provide that our rights under these agreements may be cancelled by SNH upon the acquisition by any person or group of more than 9.8% of our voting stock, and upon other change in control events, as defined in those documents including, in certain of the leases and management agreements, the adoption of any proposal (other than a precatory proposal) or the election to our Board of Directors of any individual if such proposal or individual was not approved, nominated or appointed, as the case may be, by vote of a majority of our Directors in office immediately prior to the making of such proposal or the nomination or appointment of such individual. In addition, a change in control event of us, including upon the acquisition by any person or group of more than 35% of our voting stock, is a default under our credit agreement, unless approved by our lenders.\nOur ownership interest in AIC may prevent stockholders from accumulating large share ownership, from nominating or serving as Directors, or from taking actions to otherwise control our business.\nAs an owner of AIC, we are licensed and approved as an insurance holding company; and any stockholder who owns or controls 10% or more of our securities or anyone who wishes to solicit proxies for election of, or to serve as, one of our Directors or for another proposal of business not approved by our Board of Directors may be required to receive pre-clearance from the concerned insurance regulators. These pre-approval procedures may discourage or prevent investors from purchasing our securities, from nominating persons to serve as our Directors or from taking other actions.\nOur rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our Directors and officers are limited.\nOur charter limits the liability of our Directors and officers to us and our stockholders for money damages to the maximum extent permitted under Maryland law. Under current Maryland law, our Directors and officers will not have any liability to us and our stockholders for money damages other than liability resulting from:\n\u00b7\nactual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services; or\n\u00b7\nactive and deliberate dishonesty by such Director or officer that was established by a final judgment as being material to the cause of action adjudicated.\nOur charter and contractual obligations authorize and may require us to indemnify our present and former Directors and officers for actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. However, except with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, we will indemnify any person referenced in the previous sentence in connection with a proceeding initiated by such person against us only if such proceeding is authorized by our charter or bylaws or by our Board of Directors or stockholders. In addition, we may be obligated to pay or reimburse the expenses incurred by our present and former Directors and officers without requiring a preliminary determination of their ultimate entitlement to indemnification. As a result, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our present and former Directors and officers than might otherwise exist absent the provisions in our charter and contracts or that might exist with other companies, which could limit your recourse in the event of actions not in your best interest.\nDisputes with SNH and RMR LLC and stockholder litigation against us or our Directors and officers may be referred to binding arbitration proceedings.\nOur contracts with SNH and RMR LLC provide that any dispute arising under those contracts may be referred to binding arbitration proceedings. Similarly, our bylaws provide that actions by our stockholders against us or against our Directors and officers, including derivative and class actions, may be referred to binding arbitration proceedings. As a result, we and our stockholders would not be able to pursue litigation for these disputes in courts against SNH, RMR LLC or our Directors and officers if the disputes were referred to arbitration. In addition, the ability to collect attorneys\u2019 fees or other damages may be limited in the arbitration proceedings, which may discourage attorneys from agreeing to represent parties wishing to commence such a proceeding.\nWe may experience losses from our business dealings with AIC.\nWe have invested approximately $6.0 million in AIC, we have purchased substantially all our property insurance in a program designed and reinsured in part by AIC, and we periodically consider the possibilities for expanding our relationship with AIC to other types of insurance. We, SNH, ABP Trust and four other companies to which RMR LLC provides management services each own approximately 14.3% of AIC, and we and those other AIC shareholders participate in a combined insurance program designed and reinsured in part by AIC. Our principal reason for investing in AIC and for purchasing insurance in these programs is to seek to improve our financial results by obtaining improved insurance coverages at lower costs than may be otherwise available to us or by participating in any profits which we may realize as an owner of AIC. While we believe we have in the past benefitted from these arrangements, these beneficial financial results may not occur in the future, and we may need to invest additional capital in order to continue to pursue these results. AIC\u2019s business involves the risks typical of an insurance business, including the risk that it may not operate profitably. Accordingly, financial benefits from our business dealings with AIC may not be achieved in the future, and we may experience losses from these dealings.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR SECURITIES\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common shares in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common shares, and we currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nChanges in market conditions, our operating results and investors\u2019 perception of our prospects could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.\nAs with other publicly traded equity securities, the value of our common shares depends on various market conditions and other factors that may change from time to time, including:\n\u00b7\nthe liquidity of the market for our common shares;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our operating results;\n\u00b7\nchanges in analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u00b7\nthe extent of investor interest in our common shares;\n\u00b7\nmarket interest rates;\n\u00b7\nnational economic conditions; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral market conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced broad price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also cause the market price of our common shares to decline. Stockholders may be unable to resell our common shares at or above the price at which they purchased our common shares.", "PERMNO": 89252, "SIC": 8051, "TIC": "FVE"}
