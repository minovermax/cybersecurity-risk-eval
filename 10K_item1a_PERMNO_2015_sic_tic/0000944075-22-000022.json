{"cik": "944075", "company": "SOCKET MOBILE, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOwnership of the Company\u2019s securities involves a number of risks and uncertainties. Potential investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before deciding whether to invest in the Company\u2019s securities. The Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The risks described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks that are currently unknown to the Company or that the Company currently considers immaterial may also impair its business or adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations.\nWe could be materially adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic for which we are unable to predict the ultimate impact as the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in widespread impacts on the global economy, and the unfavorable impacts we may experience include:\n\u2022 Reductions or volatility in demand for one or more of our products which may be caused by the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, business closures, or financial hardship; and shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher-priced products to lower-priced products. If prolonged, such impacts can further increase the difficulty in planning our operations, which may adversely impact our results, liquidity and financial condition.\n\u2022 Inability to meet our customers\u2019 needs due to disruptions in our manufacturing operations.\n\u2022 Failure of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, contract manufacturers, and distributors, to meet their obligations to the Company, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties, which may adversely impact our operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nDespite our efforts to manage and remedy these impacts to the Company, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which COVID-19 will spread and the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the virus. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control. Additionally, other new variants of COVID-19 could emerge in the future. The potential impact of possible future variants cannot be predicted at this time, and we cannot predict with any certainty the degree to, or the time period over, which our liquidity, financial position, results of operations and cash flows will be affected by this pandemic.\nA deterioration in global economic conditions may have adverse impacts on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict and may limit our ability to raise additional funds.\nIf global economic conditions deteriorate, it may have a negative impact on our business and our financial condition. We may face significant challenges if conditions in the financial markets worsen. The impact of such future developments on our business, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia\u2019s military action against Ukraine, is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. If the overall economy is negatively impacted for an extended period, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected. In addition, a severe prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to the business, including weakening our ability to develop potential businesses and a decreased ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe may not maintain ongoing profitability.\nTo maintain ongoing profitability, we must accomplish numerous objectives, including achieving continued growth in our business, providing ongoing support to application providers who support the use of our data capture solutions, and developing successful new products. We cannot foresee with any certainty whether we will be able to achieve these objectives in the future. Accordingly, we may not generate sufficient revenue or control our expenses enough to maintain ongoing profitability. If we cannot maintain ongoing profitability, we will not be able to support our operations from positive cash flows, and we would be required to use our existing cash to support operating losses. If we are unable to secure the necessary capital to replace that cash, we may need to suspend some or all of our current operations.\nWe may require additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, or on terms that would not cause substantial dilution to investors\u2019 stock holdings.\nWe may need to raise capital to fund our growth or operating losses in future periods. Our forecasts are highly dependent on factors beyond our control, including market acceptance of our products and delays in deployments by businesses of applications that use our data capture products. Even if we maintain profitable operating levels, we may need to raise capital to provide sufficient working capital to fund our growth. If capital requirements vary materially from those currently planned, we may require additional capital sooner than expected. There can be no assurance that such capital will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nIf application providers are not successful in their efforts to develop, market and sell their applications into which our software and products are incorporated, we may not achieve our sales projections.\nWe are dependent upon application providers to integrate our scanning and software products into their applications designed for mobile workers using smartphones, tablets and mobile computers, and to successfully market and sell those application products and solutions into the marketplace. We focus on serving the needs of application providers as sales of our data capture products are application driven. However, these application providers may take considerable time to complete development of their applications, may experience delays in their development timelines, may develop competing applications, may be unsuccessful in marketing and selling their application products and solutions to customers, or may experience delays in customer deployments and implementations, which would adversely affect our ability to achieve our revenue projections.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and stock price.\nWe have evaluated and will continue to evaluate our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires an annual management assessment of the design and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition and access to assets, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our stock could drop significantly.\nDespite security protections, our business records and information could be hacked by unauthorized personnel.\nWe protect our business records and information from access by unauthorized personnel and are not aware of any instances where such data has been compromised. We maintain adequate segregation of duties in safeguarding our assets and related records and monitor our systems to detect any attempts to bypass our controls and procedures which we evaluate and update from time to time. We are aware that unauthorized efforts to access our business records and information with sophisticated tools could bypass our controls and procedures and we remain alert to that possibility.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe expect to experience quarterly fluctuations in operating results in the future. We generally ship orders as received, and as a result we may have little backlog. Quarterly revenues and operating results therefore depend on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Historically, we have often recognized a substantial portion of our revenue in the last month of the quarter. This subjects us to the risk that even modest delays in orders or in the manufacture of products relating to orders received, may adversely affect our quarterly operating results. Our operating results may also fluctuate due to factors such as:\n\u2022 the demand for our products;\n\u2022 the size and timing of customer orders;\n\u2022 unanticipated delays or problems in our introduction of new products and product enhancements;\n\u2022 the introduction of new products and product enhancements by our competitors;\n\u2022 the timing of the introduction and deployments of new applications that work with our products;\n\u2022 changes in the revenues attributable to royalties and engineering development services;\n\u2022 product mix;\n\u2022 timing of software enhancements;\n\u2022 changes in the level of operating expenses;\n\u2022 competitive conditions in the industry including competitive pressures resulting in lower average selling prices;\n\u2022 timing of distributors\u2019 shipments to their customers;\n\u2022 delays in supplies of key components used in the manufacturing of our products; and\n\u2022 general economic conditions and conditions specific to our customers\u2019 industries.\nBecause we base our staffing and other operating expenses on anticipated revenues, unanticipated declines or delays in the receipt of orders can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter. As a result of any of the foregoing factors, or a combination, our results of operations in any given quarter may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors, in which case the market price of our common stock would be adversely affected.\nIn order to maintain the availability of our bank lines of credit we must remain in compliance with the covenants as specified under the terms of the credit agreements and the bank may exercise discretion in making advances to us.\nOur credit agreements with our bank requires us to remain in compliance with the covenants specified under the terms of the agreement. The agreements also contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict our ability to, among other things, grant liens, make investments, incur indebtedness, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, make acquisitions, pay dividends or make distributions, repurchase stock, enter into transactions with affiliates and enter into restrictive agreements, in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type. The agreements also contain customary events of default including, among others, payment defaults, breaches of covenants, bankruptcy and insolvency events, cross defaults with certain material indebtedness, judgment defaults, and breaches of representations and warranties. Upon an event of default, our bank may declare all or a portion of our outstanding obligations payable to be immediately due and payable and exercise other rights and remedies provided for under the agreement. During the existence of an event of default, interest on the obligations could be increased. The agreements may be terminated by us or by our bank at any time. Upon such termination, our bank would no longer make advances under the credit agreement and outstanding advances would be repaid as receivables are collected. All advances are at our bank\u2019s discretion and our bank is not obligated to make advances.\nDeferred tax assets comprise a significant portion of our assets and are dependent upon future tax profitability to realize the benefits.\nWe have recorded deferred tax assets on our balance sheet because we believe that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient tax profitability in the future to realize the tax savings that our deferred tax assets represent. If we do not achieve and maintain sufficient profitability, the tax savings represented by our deferred tax assets may never be realized and we would need to recognize a loss for those deferred tax assets.\nWe may be unable to manufacture our products because we are dependent on a limited number of qualified suppliers for our components.\nSeveral of our component parts are produced by one or a limited number of suppliers. Shortages or delays could occur in these essential components due to an interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry. Suppliers may choose to restrict credit terms or require advance payment causing delays in the procurement of essential materials. If we are unable to procure certain component parts, we could be required to reduce our operations while we seek alternative sources for these components, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. To the extent that we acquire extra inventory stocks to protect against possible shortages, we would be exposed to additional risks associated with holding inventory, such as obsolescence, excess quantities, or loss.\nIf we fail to develop and introduce new products rapidly and successfully, we will not be able to compete effectively, and our ability to generate sufficient revenues will be negatively affected.\nThe market for our products is prone to rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and short product life cycles. If we are unsuccessful at developing and introducing new products and services on a timely basis that include the latest technologies, conform to the newest standards, and that are appealing to end users, we will not be able to compete effectively, and our ability to generate significant revenues will be seriously harmed.\nThe development of new products and services can be very difficult and requires high levels of innovation. The development process is also lengthy and costly. Short product life cycles for smartphones and tablets expose our products to the risk of obsolescence and require frequent new product upgrades and introductions. We will be unable to introduce new products and services into the market on a timely basis and compete successfully if we fail to:\n\u2022 invest significant resources in research and development, sales and marketing, and customer support;\n\u2022 identify emerging trends, demands and standards in the field of mobile computing products;\n\u2022 enhance our products by adding additional features;\n\u2022 maintain superior or competitive performance in our products; and\n\u2022 anticipate our end users\u2019 needs and technological trends accurately.\nWe cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to make adequate investments in research and development or that we will be able to identify trends or make the technological advances necessary to be competitive.\nWe may not be able to collect receivables from customers who experience financial difficulties.\nOur accounts receivables are derived primarily from distributors. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers\u2019 financial conditions but generally require no collateral from our customers. Reserves are maintained for potential credit losses, and such losses have historically been within such reserves. However, many of our customers may be thinly capitalized and may be prone to failure in adverse market conditions. Although our collection history has been good, from time to time a customer may not pay us because of financial difficulty, bankruptcy or liquidation. If global financial conditions have an impact on our customers\u2019 ability to pay us in a timely manner, and consequently, we may experience increased difficulty in collecting our accounts receivable, and we may have to increase our reserves in anticipation of increased uncollectible accounts.\nWe could face increased competition in the future, which would adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe market in which we operate is very competitive. Our future financial performance is contingent on a number of unpredictable factors, including that:\n\u2022 some of our competitors have greater financial, marketing, and technical resources than we do;\n\u2022 we periodically face intense price competition, particularly when our competitors have excess inventories and discount their prices to clear their inventories; and\n\u2022 certain manufacturers of tablets and mobile phones offer products with built-in functions, such as Bluetooth wireless technology or barcode scanning, that compete with our products.\nIncreased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins, and loss of market share. Our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products, our operating results will suffer.\nThe demand for our products depends on many factors and is difficult to forecast as we introduce and support more products, and as competition in the markets for our products intensifies. If demand is lower than forecasted levels, we could have excess production resulting in higher inventories of finished products and components, which could lead to write-downs or write-offs of some or all of the excess inventories, and reductions in our cash balances. Lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess manufacturing capacity at our third-party manufacturers and in our failure to meet minimum purchase commitments, each of which may lower our operating results.\nIf demand increases beyond forecasted levels, we would have to rapidly increase production at our third-party manufacturers. We depend on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components, and suppliers might not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand. Even if we were able to procure enough components, our third-party manufacturers might not be able to produce enough of our devices to meet our customer demand. In addition, rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for manufacturing and supply of components and other expenses. These higher costs could lower our profit margins. Further, if production is increased rapidly, manufacturing yields could decline, which may also lower operating results.\nWe rely primarily on distributors to distribute our products, and our sales would suffer if any of these distributors stops distributing our products effectively.\nBecause we distribute and fulfill resellers\u2019 orders for our products primarily through distributors, we are subject to risks associated with channel distribution, such as risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products. Our distribution channels may build up inventories in anticipation of growth in their sales. If such growth in their sales does not occur as anticipated, the inventory build-up could contribute to higher levels of product returns. The lack of sales by any one significant participant in our distribution channels could result in excess inventories and adversely affect our operating results and working capital liquidity. During the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, Ingram Micro\u00ae and BlueStar together represented approximately 54% and 55%, respectively, of our worldwide sales. We expect that a significant portion of our sales will continue to depend on sales to a limited number of distributors.\nOur agreements with distributors are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated on short notice by them without cause. Our distributors are not within our control, are not obligated to purchase products from us, and may offer competitive lines of products simultaneously. Sales growth is contingent in part on our ability to enter into additional distribution relationships and expand our sales channels. We cannot predict whether we will be successful in establishing new distribution relationships, expanding our sales channels or maintaining our existing relationships. A failure to enter into new distribution relationships, to expand our sales channels, or to maintain our existing relationships could adversely impact our ability to grow our sales.\nWe allow our distribution channels to return a portion of their inventory to us for full credit against other purchases. In addition, in the event we reduce our prices, we credit our distributors for the difference between the purchase price of products remaining in their inventory and our reduced price for such products. Actual returns and price protection may adversely affect future operating results and working capital liquidity by reducing our accounts receivable and increasing our inventory balances, particularly since we seek to continually introduce new and enhanced products and are likely to face increasing price competition.\nWe depend on alliances and other business relationships with third parties, and a disruption in these relationships would hinder our ability to develop and sell our products.\nWe depend on strategic alliances and business relationships with leading participants in various segments of the mobile applications market to help us develop and market our products. Our strategic partners may revoke their commitment to our products or services at any time in the future or may develop their own competitive products or services. Accordingly, our strategic relationships may not result in sustained business alliances, successful product or service offerings, or the generation of significant revenues. Failure of one or more of such alliances could result in delay or termination of product development projects, failure to win new customers, or loss of confidence by current or potential customers.\nWe have devoted significant research and development resources to design products to work with a number of operating systems used in mobile devices including Apple\u00ae (iOS), Google\u2122 (Android\u2122) and Microsoft\u00ae (Windows\u00ae). Such design activities have diverted financial and personnel resources from other development projects. These design activities are not undertaken pursuant to any agreement under which Apple, Google or Microsoft is obligated to collaborate or to support the products produced from such collaboration. Consequently, these organizations may terminate their collaborations with us for a variety of reasons, including our failure to meet agreed-upon standards or for reasons beyond our control, such as changing market conditions, increased competition, discontinued product lines, and product obsolescence.\nOur intellectual property and proprietary rights may be insufficient to protect our competitive position.\nOur business depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret laws, and other restrictions on disclosure to protect our proprietary technologies. We cannot be sure that these measures will provide meaningful protection for our proprietary technologies and processes. We cannot be sure that any patent issued to us will be sufficient to protect our technology. The failure of any patents to provide protection to our technology would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products. In connection with our participation in the development of various industry standards, we may be required to license certain of our patents to other parties, including our competitors that develop products based upon the adopted standards.\nWe also generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, distributors, and strategic partners, and generally control access to our documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third-party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products, services, or technology without authorization, develop similar technology independently, or design around our patents.\nAdditionally, effective copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries.\nWe may become subject to claims of intellectual property rights infringement, which could result in substantial liability.\nIn the course of operating our business, we may receive claims of intellectual property infringement or otherwise become aware of potentially relevant patents or other intellectual property rights held by other parties. Many of our competitors have large intellectual property portfolios, including patents that may cover technologies that are relevant to our business. In addition, many smaller companies, universities, and individuals have obtained or applied for patents in areas of technology that may relate to our business. The industry is moving towards aggressive assertion, licensing, and litigation of patents and other intellectual property rights.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain licenses on favorable terms for intellectual property rights required for the manufacture, sale, and use of our products, particularly those products which must comply with industry standard protocols and specifications to be commercially viable, our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition to disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of other parties\u2019 rights, we may become involved in disputes relating to our assertion of our own intellectual property rights. Whether we are defending the assertion of intellectual property rights against us or asserting our intellectual property rights against others, intellectual property litigation can be complex, costly, protracted, and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. Plaintiffs in intellectual property cases often seek injunctive relief, and the measures of damages in intellectual property litigation are complex and often subjective or uncertain. Thus, any adverse determinations in this type of litigation could subject us to significant liabilities and costs.\nNew industry standards may require us to redesign our products, which could substantially increase our operating expenses.\nStandards for the form and functionality of our products are established by standards committees. These independent committees establish standards, which evolve and change over time, for different categories of our products. We must continue to identify and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards so that our products are interoperable and we remain competitive. Unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software application providers. Should any major changes, even if anticipated, occur, we would be required to invest significant time and resources to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards. If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards for a significant period of time, we would miss opportunities to sell our products for use with new hardware components from mobile computer manufacturers and OEMs, thus affecting our business.\nUndetected flaws and defects in our products may disrupt product sales and result in expensive and time-consuming remedial action.\nOur hardware and software products may contain undetected flaws, which may not be discovered until customers have used the products. From time to time, we may temporarily suspend or delay shipments or divert development resources from other projects to correct a particular product deficiency. Efforts to identify and correct errors and make design changes may be expensive and time consuming. Failure to discover product deficiencies in the future could delay product introductions or shipments, require us to recall previously shipped products to make design modifications, or cause unfavorable publicity, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe loss of one or more of our senior personnel could harm our existing business.\nA number of our officers and senior managers have been employed for more than twenty years by us, including our President, Chief Financial Officer, Vice President of Operations and Vice President of Engineering/Chief Technical Officer. Our future success will depend upon the continued service of key officers and senior managers. Competition for officers and senior managers is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our existing senior personnel. The loss of one or more of our officers or key senior managers could adversely affect our ability to compete.\nThe expensing of options and restricted stocks will continue to reduce our operating results such that we may find it necessary to change our business practices to attract and retain employees.\nWe have been using stock options and restricted stocks as a key component of our employee compensation packages. We believe that stock options and restricted stocks provide an incentive to our employees to maximize long-term stockholder value and, through the use of vesting, encourage valued employees to remain with us. The expensing of employee stock options and restricted stocks adversely affects our net income and earnings per share, will continue to adversely affect future quarters, and will make profitability harder to achieve. In addition, we may decide in response to the effects of expensing stock options and restricted stock on our operating results to reduce the number of stock options or restricted stocks granted to employees or to grant to fewer employees. This could adversely affect our ability to retain existing employees or attract qualified candidates, and also could increase the cash compensation we would have to pay to them.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled sales and marketing and product development personnel, our ability to develop and market new products and product enhancements will be adversely affected.\nWe believe our ability to achieve increased revenues and to develop successful new products and product enhancements will depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled sales and marketing and product development personnel. Our products involve a number of new and evolving technologies, and we frequently need to apply these technologies to the unique requirements of mobile products. Our personnel must be familiar with both the technologies we support and the unique requirements of the products to which our products connect. Competition for such personnel is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain such key personnel. In addition, our ability to hire and retain such key personnel will depend upon our ability to raise capital or achieve increased revenue levels to fund the costs associated with such key personnel. Failure to attract and retain such key personnel will adversely affect our ability to develop and market new products and product enhancements.\nOur operating results could be harmed by economic, political, regulatory and other risks associated with export sales.\nOur operating results are subject to the risks inherent in export sales, including:\n\u2022 longer payment cycles;\n\u2022 unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, import and export restrictions and tariffs;\n\u2022 difficulties in managing foreign operations;\n\u2022 the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws;\n\u2022 greater difficulty or delay in accounts receivable collection;\n\u2022 potentially adverse tax consequences; and\n\u2022 political and economic instability (such as Russia\u2019s military action against Ukraine)..\nOur export sales are primarily denominated in Euros for our sales to European distributors and in British pounds for our sales to UK distributors. Accordingly, an increase in the value of the United States dollar relative to Euro or British pound could make our products more expensive and therefore potentially less competitive in European markets. Declines in the value of the Euro or pound relative to the United States dollar may result in foreign currency losses relating to collection of receivables denominated if left unhedged.\nOur facilities or operations could be adversely affected by events outside our control, such as natural disasters or health epidemics.\nOur corporate headquarters is located in a seismically active region in Northern California. If major disasters such as earthquakes occur, or our information system or communications network breaks down or operates improperly, our headquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged, or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products. In addition, we may be affected by health epidemic or pandemics, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, or geopolitical instability, such as Russia\u2019s military action against Ukraine. We may incur expenses or delays relating to such events outside of our control, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price for our common stock. The market price of our common stock could also decline if one or more of our significant stockholders decided for any reason to sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market.\nAs of March 25, 2022, we had 7,273,051 shares of common stock outstanding. Substantially all of these shares are freely tradable in the public market, either without restriction or subject, in some cases, only to S-3 prospectus delivery requirements and, in other cases, only to manner of sale, volume, and notice requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act.\nAs of March 25, 2022, we had 1,353,923 shares of common stock subject to outstanding options under our stock option plans, and 288,393 shares of common stock were available for future issuance under the plans. We have registered the shares of common stock subject to outstanding options and reserved for issuance under our stock option plans. Accordingly, the shares of common stock underlying vested options will be eligible for resale in the public market as soon as the options are exercised.\nVolatility in the trading price of our common stock could negatively impact the price of our common stock.\nDuring the period from January 1, 2021 through March 25, 2022, our common stock price fluctuated between a high of $35.00 and a low of $0.76. We have experienced low trading volumes in our stock, and thus relatively small purchases and sales can have a significant effect on our stock price. The trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and the outlook of securities analysts and investors on our industry. In addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for high technology stocks in particular, have experienced high volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 81741, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "SCKT"}
