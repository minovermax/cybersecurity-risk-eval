Actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this report. Any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nChanges in the demand for our products and services could negatively affect our operating results.\nThe frequency of visits to our animal hospitals has declined and may continue to decline. We believe that the frequency of visits is impacted by consumer spending habits, which are affected by a number of factors, including among other things, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions. The United States and Canadian economies have undergone and may in the future undergo, significant volatility and disruption. Business and financial disruptions in the United States' and Canadian economies could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our services. In addition, economic concerns may cause some pet owners to elect to skip or defer visits to veterinary hospitals, affect their willingness to approve certain diagnostic tests, comply with a treatment plan, forgo expensive treatment options, defer treatment for their pets altogether or even own a pet. Additionally, the frequency of visits to our animal hospitals and the number of diagnostic tests performed by our laboratories may be negatively impacted as a result of preventative care and better pet nutrition. Demand for vaccinations will be impacted in the future as protocols for vaccinations change. Our veterinarians establish their own vaccine protocols. Some of our veterinarians have changed their protocols and others may change their protocols in light of recent and/or future literature. The demand for our products and services may decline as a result of the eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases. Also, many pet-related products traditionally sold at animal hospitals have become more widely available in retail stores and other channels of distribution, including the Internet, resulting in a decline in demand for these products at our animal hospitals. All of the foregoing may result in a decrease in sales of our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe significant competition in the companion animal healthcare industry could result in a decrease in our prices, an increase in our acquisition costs, a loss of market share and could materially affect our revenue and profitability.\nThe companion animal healthcare industry is highly competitive with few barriers to entry and we expect that competition may become even more intense in the future. New competitors have been entering our market and may continue to do so and existing competitors may introduce new and competitive products and services. Some of our competitors or potential competitors may seek to differentiate themselves by offering similar products or services at lower prices or bundled product and service offerings through co-marketing arrangements. To compete successfully, we may be required to reduce prices, increase\nour acquisition and operating costs or take other measures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, margins and cash flow. In addition, if we are unable to compete successfully, we may lose market share.\nA significant component of our annual growth strategy includes the acquisition of independent animal hospitals. The competition for animal hospital acquisitions from national and regional multi-clinic companies may cause us to increase the amount we pay to acquire additional animal hospitals and may result in fewer acquisitions than anticipated by our growth strategy. If we are unable to acquire our forecasted number of animal hospitals in any year, or if our acquisition costs increase, we may be unable to effectively implement our growth strategy and realize anticipated increases in Animal Hospital revenue and operating income.\nSome national companies in the pet care industry, including the operators of super-stores, are developing networks of animal hospitals in markets that include our animal hospitals; this may cause us to reduce prices to remain competitive. Reducing prices may have a material adverse effect on our Animal Hospital revenue, operating income and margins, alternatively not reducing prices may cause us to lose market share.\nWe compete with clinical laboratory companies in the same markets we service. Some of these companies have acquired additional laboratories in the markets in which we operate and may continue their expansion, and aggressively \u201cbundle\u201d their products and services to compete with us. Increased competition may materially adversely affect our Laboratory revenue and margins. Several national companies develop and sell on-site diagnostic equipment that allows veterinarians to perform their own laboratory tests. Growth of the on-site diagnostic testing market may have a material adverse effect on our Laboratory revenue and operating income.\nOur medical technology business is a leader in the market for medical imaging equipment in the animal healthcare industry. Our primary competitors are companies that are much larger than us and have substantially greater capital, manufacturing, marketing and research and development resources than we do, including companies such as Siemens, Philips and Canon. The success of our medical technology business, in part, is due to its focus on the veterinary market, which allows us to differentiate our products and services to meet the unique needs of this market. If this market receives more focused attention from these larger competitors, we may find it difficult to compete and as a result our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely and negatively impacted.\nOur Vetstreet business operates in the online communication, professional education and marketing business within the animal healthcare industry. We believe that the primary factors influencing a customer's selection of a company which provides services such as Vetstreet to be price, breadth of product offerings and ease of integration with existing systems. The competitive landscape in this business changed during 2012. Five competitors have launched pet portal product offerings similar to Vetstreet's. We consider three of the five to be direct competitors. Vetstreet\u2019s main competition in this space is IDEXX, Demand Force, and ePet Health.\nIf we are unable to effectively execute our growth strategy, it may have a negative impact on our growth and profitability.\nOur ability to maintain or enhance our growth rates and profitability depends in part on our ability to increase our revenue and operating income through a balanced program of organic growth initiatives and selective acquisitions of established animal hospitals, laboratories and related businesses. If we are not able to implement or effectively execute on this strategy, our rate of growth or profitability may be negatively impacted. We currently have implemented several key initiatives in order to enhance our organic growth rates such as our Client Experience program, our Veterinarian Communication training and our VCA CareClubTM wellness plans. We have also entered into an agreement with several distributors to collaborate on the introduction of our laboratory services to their substantial list of customers in order to increase our market share. We experienced a decline in same-store revenue growth in our animal hospitals for ten consecutive quarters, which ended in the second quarter of 2011. Our Laboratory growth had also been affected and became negative during certain quarters of the three year period ending December 31, 2010. Our Animal Hospital same-store revenue, adjusted for differences in business days, has fluctuated between a decline of 2.5% and growth of 2.8% for 2010 through 2014. Our Laboratory internal revenue growth, adjusted for differences in billing days, has fluctuated between 0% and 5.3% over the same years. Our internal growth may continue to fluctuate and may be below our historical rates. Any reduction in the rate of our internal growth may cause our revenue and operating income to decrease. Investors should not assume that our historical growth rates are reliable indicators of results in future periods.\nDue to the fixed cost nature of our business, fluctuations in our revenue could adversely affect our gross profit, operating income and margins.\nA substantial portion of our expense, particularly rent and personnel costs, are fixed and are based in part on expectations of revenue. We may be unable to reduce spending in a timely manner to compensate for any significant fluctuations in our revenue. Accordingly, shortfalls in revenue may materially adversely affect our gross profit, operating income and margins.\nWe may experience difficulties hiring skilled veterinarians due to shortages that could disrupt our business.\nFrom time to time we experience shortages of skilled veterinarians in some regional markets in which we operate animal hospitals which may require us to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain enough qualified veterinarians to adequately staff our animal hospitals. If our labor costs increase, we may not be able to raise our rates for our products and services to offset these increased costs. Our failure to recruit and retain qualified veterinarians, or to control our labor costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAny failure in our information technology systems, disruption in our transportation network or failure to receive supplies could significantly increase testing turn-around time, reduce our production capacity and otherwise disrupt our operations.\nOur Laboratory operations depend on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems and transportation network, including overnight delivery services provided by FedEx. Sustained system failures or interruption in our transportation network could disrupt our ability to process laboratory requisitions, perform testing, provide test results in a timely manner and/or bill the appropriate party. We could lose customers and revenue as a result of a system or transportation network failure. In addition, any change in government regulation related to transportation samples or specimens could also have an impact on our business.\nOur computer systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including telecommunications failures, electricity brownouts or blackouts, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security measures, some of our servers are potentially vulnerable to digital break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. Despite the precautions we have taken, unanticipated problems affecting our systems could cause interruptions in our information technology systems. Our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to any failures in our systems.\nOur Laboratory operations depend on a limited number of employees to upgrade and maintain its customized computer systems. If we were to lose the services of some or all of these employees, it may be time-consuming for new employees to become familiar with our systems, and we may experience disruptions in service during these periods.\nOur operations depend, in some cases, on the ability of single source suppliers or a limited number of suppliers, to deliver products and supplies on a timely basis. Some of these suppliers are smaller companies with limited capital resources and some of the products that we purchase from these suppliers are proprietary, and, therefore, cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative suppliers. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, shortages of or difficulties in acquiring products and/or supplies in the quantities and of the quality needed. Shortages in the availability of products and/or supplies for an extended period of time will disrupt our ability to deliver products and provide services in a timely manner, could result in the loss of customers, and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nDifficulties integrating new acquisitions may impose increased costs, loss of customers and a decline in operating margins and profitability and other risks that we may not anticipate.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to timely and cost-effectively acquire, and integrate into our business, additional animal hospitals, laboratories and related businesses. In 2014, we acquired 47 animal hospitals and Camp Bow Wow. In 2013, we acquired 20 animal hospitals and one laboratory and in 2012, we acquired 79 animal hospitals, including 44 in Canada with the acquisition of AVC, one laboratory and ThinkPets. We expect to continue our animal hospital acquisition program and, if presented with favorable opportunities, we may acquire animal hospital chains, laboratories or related businesses. Our expansion into new territories and new business segments creates the risk that we will be unsuccessful in the integration of the acquired businesses that are new to our operations. Any difficulties in the integration process could result in increased expense, loss of customers and a decline in operating margins and profitability. In some cases, we have experienced delays and increased costs in integrating acquired businesses, particularly where we acquire a large number of animal hospitals in a single region at or about the same time. We also could experience delays in converting the systems of acquired businesses into our systems, which could result in increased staff and payroll expense to collect our results as well as delays in reporting our results, both for a particular region and on a consolidated basis. Further, the legal and business environment prevalent in\nnew territories and with respect to new businesses may pose risks that we do not anticipate and materially adversely impact our ability to integrate newly acquired operations. In addition, our field management may spend a greater amount of time integrating these new businesses and less time managing our existing businesses. During these periods, there may be less attention directed to marketing efforts or staffing issues, which could affect our revenue and expense. For all of these reasons, our historical success in integrating acquired businesses is not a reliable indicator of our ability to do so in the future.\nThe growth in multi-clinic animal hospital organizations and buying consortiums has resulted in the increased dependence in our Laboratory and Medical Technology Divisions on a few large supply contracts, the loss of any one of which could have a material adverse impact on our laboratory business and results of operations.\nAn increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals in the U.S. are owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals and/or opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally. Major corporate hospital owners in the U.S. include Banfield Pet Hospital and National Veterinary Associates, each of which is currently a customer of ours. A similar trend exists in Canada and may in the future also develop in other international markets. Furthermore, an increasing percentage of individually-owned veterinary hospitals in the U.S. are participating in buying consortiums. Corporate owners of veterinary hospitals and buying consortiums often seek to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. While we have strong supplier relationships with several corporate hospital groups and buying consortiums, decisions by larger corporate owners and buying consortiums to shift their purchasing of products and services away from us and to a competitor would have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nOur business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions.\nDespite the precautions we have taken, we may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions. These may be caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar events or disruptions. System redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. In addition, we rely on third parties for payment processing and secure handling of credit card and other confidential information. Failures or disruptions in their systems could prevent access to our services. System failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products, delivery of online services, transactions processing and financial reporting. If any of the above were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to loss of sensitive data that could subject us to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\nOur business requires us to use and store customer, employee and business personally identifiable information. This may include names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers and payment account information. We require user names and passwords in order to access our information technology systems. We also use encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data. These security measures may be compromised as a result of third-party security breaches, fraud, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities, and result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to our data or our customers\u2019 accounts. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords, payment information or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems.\nWe devote significant resources to network security, data encryption, and other security measures to protect our systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security. We may experience a breach of our systems and may be unable to protect sensitive data. Moreover, if fraud or a computer security breach affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of data, our reputation and brand could be materially damaged and use of our products and services could decrease. As a consequence, we could also be exposed to the risk of direct loss or litigation, governmental investigations and inquiries and possible liability.\nFailure to comply with federal, state and international laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, or the expansion of current or the enactment of new laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, could adversely affect our business and our financial condition.\nA variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data. Laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection are evolving and are subject to potentially differing interpretations.\nWe strive to comply with all applicable laws, regulations and other legal obligations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, including those relating to the use of data for marketing purposes. It is possible, however, that these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or may conflict with other rules or our practices. We cannot guarantee that our practices have complied, comply or will comply fully with all such laws, regulations, requirements and obligations. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any federal, state or international privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations industry self-regulatory principles industry standards or codes of conduct, regulatory guidance, orders to which we may be subject or other legal obligations relating to privacy or consumer protection could adversely affect our reputation, brand and business, and may result in claims, proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others or other liabilities. Any such claim, proceeding or action could hurt our reputation, brand and business, force us to incur significant expenses in defense of such proceedings, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, result in a loss of customers and suppliers and may result in the imposition of monetary liability. We may also be contractually liable to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or consequences of non-compliance with any laws, regulations or other legal obligations relating to privacy or consumer protection or any inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure of data that we store or handle as part of operating our business. Many foreign countries have adopted similar laws governing privacy. As we expand internationally, we will be subject to these laws and regulations, as well as to foreign intellectual property laws, laws regulating competition and other laws. There can be no assurance that we will not violate any applicable current or future foreign laws and regulations, which could result in fines and other penalties against us, litigation and/or regulatory action, damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to successfully expand our business internationally, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, various federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies, or self-regulatory organizations, may expand current laws or regulations, enact new laws or regulations or issue revised rules or guidance regarding privacy, data protection and consumer protection. Any such changes may force us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices. This could compromise our ability to pursue our growth strategy effectively and may adversely affect our ability to acquire customers or otherwise harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets could be subject to an impairment write-down.\nAt December 31, 2014, our consolidated balance sheet reflected $1.4 billion of goodwill and $88.2 million of other intangible assets, constituting a substantial portion of our total assets of $2.3 billion at that date. We expect that the aggregate amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet will increase as a result of future acquisitions. We continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that suggest that the fair value of our other intangible assets or each of our reporting units are below their respective carrying values. The determination that the fair value of our intangible assets or one of our reporting units is less than its carrying value would result in an impairment write-down. The impairment write-down would be reflected as an operating expense and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations during the period in which we recognize the expense.\nOur estimated fair values are calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles related to fair value and utilize valuation methods consisting primarily of discounted cash flow techniques, and market comparables, where applicable. These valuation methods involve the use of significant assumptions and estimates such as forecasted growth rates, valuation multiples, the weighted-average cost of capital, and risk premiums, which are based upon the best available market information and are consistent with our long-term strategic plans. We provide no assurance that forecasted growth rates, valuation multiples, and discount rates will not deteriorate or that we will not incur additional impairment charges. We will continue to analyze changes to these assumptions in future periods.\nLoss of our executive officers could disrupt our operations.\nWe depend on the efforts of a relatively few executive officers. Our executive officers are not currently, and are not expected to be, subject to non-compete provisions. In addition, our four most senior executive officers have served the Company in their capacities for more than 25 years. Any unplanned turnover or our failure to develop an adequate succession plan for one or more of our executive officer positions upon their retirement could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage. The loss or limited availability of the services of one or more of our executive officers, or our inability to recruit and retain qualified executive officers in the future, could, at least temporarily, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and expand our business as planned.\nWe have, and will continue to have, a substantial amount of debt. Our substantial amount of debt requires us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to service interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby reducing the funds available for use for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate purposes.\nOur failure to satisfy covenants in our debt instruments will cause a default under those instruments.\nIn addition to imposing restrictions on our business and operations, our debt instruments include a number of covenants relating to financial ratios and tests. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. The breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under these instruments. An event of default would permit our lenders and other debtholders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If we are unable to repay debt to our senior lenders, these lenders and other debtholders could proceed against our assets.\nOur debt instruments may adversely affect our ability to run our business.\nOur substantial amount of debt, as well as the guarantees of our subsidiaries and the security interests in our assets and those of our subsidiaries, could impair our ability to operate our business effectively and may limit our ability to take advantage of business opportunities. For example, our senior credit facility may:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds or to obtain other financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to dispose of our assets, create liens on our assets or to extend credit;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to economic downturns and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or industry;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors with less debt; and\n\u2022\nrestrict our ability to pay dividends, repurchase or redeem our capital stock or debt, or merge or consolidate with another entity.\nThe terms of our senior credit facility allow us, under specified conditions, to incur further indebtedness, which would heighten the foregoing risks. If compliance with our debt obligations materially hinders our ability to operate our business and adapt to changing industry conditions, we may lose market share, our revenue may decline and our operating results may suffer.\nAny failure by the manufacturers of our medical imaging equipment, failure in our ability to develop functional and cost-effective software for our products, or any product malfunctions could result in a decline in customer purchases and a reduction in our revenue and profitability.\nWe do not develop or manufacture the medical imaging equipment that we distribute, except for the software component of our digital radiography machines. Our business in large part is dependent upon distribution agreements with the manufacturers of the equipment, the ability of those manufacturers to produce desirable equipment and to keep pace with advances in technology, our ability to develop cost-effective, functional, and user-friendly software for the digital radiography machines, and the overall rate of new development within the industry. If the distribution agreements terminate or are not renewed, if the manufacturers breach their covenants under these agreements, if the equipment manufactured by these manufacturers or our software becomes less competitive or if there is a general decrease in the rate of new development within the industry, demand for our products and services would decrease.\nManufacturing flaws, component failures, design defects, or inadequate disclosure of product-related information could result in an unsafe condition or injury. These problems could result in product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that our products have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury. In addition, a material adverse event involving one of our products could result in reduced market acceptance and demand for all of our products, and could harm our reputation and\nour ability to market our products in the future. Any of the foregoing problems could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur use of self-insurance, self-insured retention and high-deductible insurance programs to cover certain claims for losses suffered and costs or expenses incurred could negatively impact our business upon the occurrence of an uninsured and/or significant event.\nWe self-insure and use high-retention or high-deductible insurance programs with regard to property risks, general, professional and employment practice liabilities, health benefits, and workers\u2019 compensation. In the event that the frequency of losses we experience increases unexpectedly, the aggregate of those losses could materially increase our liability and adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. In addition, we have made certain judgments as to the limits on our existing insurance coverage that we believe are in line with industry standards, as well as in light of economic and availability considerations. If we experience losses above these limits it could materially adversely affect our financial and business condition.\nIf we fail to comply with governmental regulations applicable to our business, various governmental agencies may impose fines, institute litigation or preclude us from operating in certain states.\nCertain states and provinces have laws, rules and regulations which require that veterinary medical practices be owned by licensed veterinarians and that corporations which are not owned by licensed veterinarians refrain from providing, or holding themselves out as providers of, veterinary medical care. At December 31, 2014, we provided management and administrative services to 184 animal hospitals in 15 states and 68 animal hospital in four Canadian provinces, under management agreements with these veterinary practices, including 48 practices in Texas, 34 in Washington, and 34 in New York. We may experience difficulty in expanding our operations into other states or provinces with similar laws, rules and regulations. Although we have structured our operations to comply with our understanding of the veterinary medicine laws of each state and province in which we operate, interpretive legal precedent and regulatory guidance varies by jurisdiction and is often sparse and not fully developed. A determination that we are in violation of applicable restrictions on the practice of veterinary medicine in any jurisdiction in which we operate, could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly if we are unable to restructure our operations to comply with the requirements of that jurisdiction.\nAll of the states in which we operate impose various registration requirements. To fulfill these requirements, we have registered each of our facilities with appropriate governmental agencies and, where required, have appointed a licensed veterinarian to act on behalf of each facility. All veterinarians practicing in our animal hospitals are required to maintain valid state licenses to practice.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our operating results.\nAt December 31, 2014, we operated 68 animal hospitals and four laboratories in Canada. Transactions in those facilities are in Canadian dollars. Any strengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar adversely affects our results, as it reduces the dollar value of sales that are made in Canada and reduces the profits on products manufactured or sourced in U.S. dollars and exported to Canada. Approximately 8.2%, 7.3% and 6.5% of our consolidated revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was derived from our operations in Canada. In the future, we may expand into other international markets. Currency exchange rates fluctuate on a daily basis as a result of a number of factors and cannot easily be predicted. To date, we have not hedged against foreign currency fluctuations; however, we may pursue hedging alternatives in the future. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between international currencies and the U.S. dollar.\nOur international operations may result in additional market risks, which may harm our business.\nAs our international operations grow, they may require greater management and financial resources. Internal operations require the integration of personnel with varying cultural and business backgrounds and an understanding of the relevant differences in the cultural, legal and regulatory environments. Our results may be increasingly affected by the risks of our international operations, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in internal staffing and employment issues,\n\u2022\nfailure to understand the local culture and market, and\n\u2022\nthe burden of complying with foreign laws, including tax and labor laws and foreign financial accounting standards.", "PERMNO": 89213, "SIC": 700, "TIC": "WOOF"}
